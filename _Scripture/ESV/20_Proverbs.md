The proverbs of Solomon, son of David, king of Israel: ^0101

To know wisdom and instruction, to understand words of insight, ^0102

to receive instruction in wise dealing, in righteousness, justice, and equity; ^0103

to give prudence to the simple, knowledge and discretion to the youth-- ^0104

Let the wise hear and increase in learning, and the one who understands obtain guidance, ^0105

to understand a proverb and a saying, the words of the wise and their riddles. ^0106

The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge; fools despise wisdom and instruction. ^0107

Hear, my son, your father's instruction, and forsake not your mother's teaching, ^0108

for they are a graceful garland for your head and pendants for your neck. ^0109

My son, if sinners entice you, do not consent. ^0110

If they say, "Come with us, let us lie in wait for blood; let us ambush the innocent without reason; ^0111

like Sheol let us swallow them alive, and whole, like those who go down to the pit; ^0112

we shall find all precious goods, we shall fill our houses with plunder; ^0113

throw in your lot among us; we will all have one purse"-- ^0114

my son, do not walk in the way with them; hold back your foot from their paths, ^0115

for their feet run to evil, and they make haste to shed blood. ^0116

For in vain is a net spread in the sight of any bird, ^0117

but these men lie in wait for their own blood; they set an ambush for their own lives. ^0118

Such are the ways of everyone who is greedy for unjust gain; it takes away the life of its possessors. ^0119

Wisdom cries aloud in the street, in the markets she raises her voice; ^0120

at the head of the noisy streets she cries out; at the entrance of the city gates she speaks: ^0121

"How long, O simple ones, will you love being simple? How long will scoffers delight in their scoffing and fools hate knowledge? ^0122

If you turn at my reproof, behold, I will pour out my spirit to you; I will make my words known to you. ^0123

Because I have called and you refused to listen, have stretched out my hand and no one has heeded, ^0124

because you have ignored all my counsel and would have none of my reproof, ^0125

I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when terror strikes you, ^0126

when terror strikes you like a storm and your calamity comes like a whirlwind, when distress and anguish come upon you. ^0127

Then they will call upon me, but I will not answer; they will seek me diligently but will not find me. ^0128

Because they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of the LORD, ^0129

would have none of my counsel and despised all my reproof, ^0130

therefore they shall eat the fruit of their way, and have their fill of their own devices. ^0131

For the simple are killed by their turning away, and the complacency of fools destroys them; ^0132

but whoever listens to me will dwell secure and will be at ease, without dread of disaster." ^0133


My son, if you receive my words and treasure up my commandments with you, ^0201

making your ear attentive to wisdom and inclining your heart to understanding; ^0202

yes, if you call out for insight and raise your voice for understanding, ^0203

if you seek it like silver and search for it as for hidden treasures, ^0204

then you will understand the fear of the LORD and find the knowledge of God. ^0205

For the LORD gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding; ^0206

he stores up sound wisdom for the upright; he is a shield to those who walk in integrity, ^0207

guarding the paths of justice and watching over the way of his saints. ^0208

Then you will understand righteousness and justice and equity, every good path; ^0209

for wisdom will come into your heart, and knowledge will be pleasant to your soul; ^0210

discretion will watch over you, understanding will guard you, ^0211

delivering you from the way of evil, from men of perverted speech, ^0212

who forsake the paths of uprightness to walk in the ways of darkness, ^0213

who rejoice in doing evil and delight in the perverseness of evil, ^0214

men whose paths are crooked, and who are devious in their ways. ^0215

So you will be delivered from the forbidden woman, from the adulteress with her smooth words, ^0216

who forsakes the companion of her youth and forgets the covenant of her God; ^0217

for her house sinks down to death, and her paths to the departed; ^0218

none who go to her come back, nor do they regain the paths of life. ^0219

So you will walk in the way of the good and keep to the paths of the righteous. ^0220

For the upright will inhabit the land, and those with integrity will remain in it, ^0221

but the wicked will be cut off from the land, and the treacherous will be rooted out of it. ^0222


My son, do not forget my teaching, but let your heart keep my commandments, ^0301

for length of days and years of life and peace they will add to you. ^0302

Let not steadfast love and faithfulness forsake you; bind them around your neck; write them on the tablet of your heart. ^0303

So you will find favor and good success in the sight of God and man. ^0304

Trust in the LORD with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding. ^0305

In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight your paths. ^0306

Be not wise in your own eyes; fear the LORD, and turn away from evil. ^0307

It will be healing to your flesh and refreshment to your bones. ^0308

Honor the LORD with your wealth and with the firstfruits of all your produce; ^0309

then your barns will be filled with plenty, and your vats will be bursting with wine. ^0310

My son, do not despise the LORD's discipline or be weary of his reproof, ^0311

for the LORD reproves him whom he loves, as a father the son in whom he delights. ^0312

Blessed is the one who finds wisdom, and the one who gets understanding, ^0313

for the gain from her is better than gain from silver and her profit better than gold. ^0314

She is more precious than jewels, and nothing you desire can compare with her. ^0315

Long life is in her right hand; in her left hand are riches and honor. ^0316

Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace. ^0317

She is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her; those who hold her fast are called blessed. ^0318

The LORD by wisdom founded the earth; by understanding he established the heavens; ^0319

by his knowledge the deeps broke open, and the clouds drop down the dew. ^0320

My son, do not lose sight of these--keep sound wisdom and discretion, ^0321

and they will be life for your soul and adornment for your neck. ^0322

Then you will walk on your way securely, and your foot will not stumble. ^0323

If you lie down, you will not be afraid; when you lie down, your sleep will be sweet. ^0324

Do not be afraid of sudden terror or of the ruin of the wicked, when it comes, ^0325

for the LORD will be your confidence and will keep your foot from being caught. ^0326

Do not withhold good from those to whom it is due, when it is in your power to do it. ^0327

Do not say to your neighbor, "Go, and come again, tomorrow I will give it"--when you have it with you. ^0328

Do not plan evil against your neighbor, who dwells trustingly beside you. ^0329

Do not contend with a man for no reason, when he has done you no harm. ^0330

Do not envy a man of violence and do not choose any of his ways, ^0331

for the devious person is an abomination to the LORD, but the upright are in his confidence. ^0332

The LORD's curse is on the house of the wicked, but he blesses the dwelling of the righteous. ^0333

Toward the scorners he is scornful, but to the humble he gives favor. ^0334

The wise will inherit honor, but fools get disgrace. ^0335


Hear, O sons, a father's instruction, and be attentive, that you may gain insight, ^0401

for I give you good precepts; do not forsake my teaching. ^0402

When I was a son with my father, tender, the only one in the sight of my mother, ^0403

he taught me and said to me, "Let your heart hold fast my words; keep my commandments, and live. ^0404

Get wisdom; get insight; do not forget, and do not turn away from the words of my mouth. ^0405

Do not forsake her, and she will keep you; love her, and she will guard you. ^0406

The beginning of wisdom is this: Get wisdom, and whatever you get, get insight. ^0407

Prize her highly, and she will exalt you; she will honor you if you embrace her. ^0408

She will place on your head a graceful garland; she will bestow on you a beautiful crown." ^0409

Hear, my son, and accept my words, that the years of your life may be many. ^0410

I have taught you the way of wisdom; I have led you in the paths of uprightness. ^0411

When you walk, your step will not be hampered, and if you run, you will not stumble. ^0412

Keep hold of instruction; do not let go; guard her, for she is your life. ^0413

Do not enter the path of the wicked, and do not walk in the way of the evil. ^0414

Avoid it; do not go on it; turn away from it and pass on. ^0415

For they cannot sleep unless they have done wrong; they are robbed of sleep unless they have made someone stumble. ^0416

For they eat the bread of wickedness and drink the wine of violence. ^0417

But the path of the righteous is like the light of dawn, which shines brighter and brighter until full day. ^0418

The way of the wicked is like deep darkness; they do not know over what they stumble. ^0419

My son, be attentive to my words; incline your ear to my sayings. ^0420

Let them not escape from your sight; keep them within your heart. ^0421

For they are life to those who find them, and healing to all their flesh. ^0422

Keep your heart with all vigilance, for from it flow the springs of life. ^0423

Put away from you crooked speech, and put devious talk far from you. ^0424

Let your eyes look directly forward, and your gaze be straight before you. ^0425

Ponder the path of your feet; then all your ways will be sure. ^0426

Do not swerve to the right or to the left; turn your foot away from evil. ^0427


My son, be attentive to my wisdom; incline your ear to my understanding, ^0501

that you may keep discretion, and your lips may guard knowledge. ^0502

For the lips of a forbidden woman drip honey, and her speech is smoother than oil, ^0503

but in the end she is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword. ^0504

Her feet go down to death; her steps follow the path to Sheol; ^0505

she does not ponder the path of life; her ways wander, and she does not know it. ^0506

And now, O sons, listen to me, and do not depart from the words of my mouth. ^0507

Keep your way far from her, and do not go near the door of her house, ^0508

lest you give your honor to others and your years to the merciless, ^0509

lest strangers take their fill of your strength, and your labors go to the house of a foreigner, ^0510

and at the end of your life you groan, when your flesh and body are consumed, ^0511

and you say, "How I hated discipline, and my heart despised reproof! ^0512

I did not listen to the voice of my teachers or incline my ear to my instructors. ^0513

I am at the brink of utter ruin in the assembled congregation." ^0514

Drink water from your own cistern, flowing water from your own well. ^0515

Should your springs be scattered abroad, streams of water in the streets? ^0516

Let them be for yourself alone, and not for strangers with you. ^0517

Let your fountain be blessed, and rejoice in the wife of your youth, ^0518

a lovely deer, a graceful doe. Let her breasts fill you at all times with delight; be intoxicated always in her love. ^0519

Why should you be intoxicated, my son, with a forbidden woman and embrace the bosom of an adulteress? ^0520

For a man's ways are before the eyes of the LORD, and he ponders all his paths. ^0521

The iniquities of the wicked ensnare him, and he is held fast in the cords of his sin. ^0522

He dies for lack of discipline, and because of his great folly he is led astray. ^0523


My son, if you have put up security for your neighbor, have given your pledge for a stranger, ^0601

if you are snared in the words of your mouth, caught in the words of your mouth, ^0602

then do this, my son, and save yourself, for you have come into the hand of your neighbor: go, hasten, and plead urgently with your neighbor. ^0603

Give your eyes no sleep and your eyelids no slumber; ^0604

save yourself like a gazelle from the hand of the hunter, like a bird from the hand of the fowler. ^0605

Go to the ant, O sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise. ^0606

Without having any chief, officer, or ruler, ^0607

she prepares her bread in summer and gathers her food in harvest. ^0608

How long will you lie there, O sluggard? When will you arise from your sleep? ^0609

A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest, ^0610

and poverty will come upon you like a robber, and want like an armed man. ^0611

A worthless person, a wicked man, goes about with crooked speech, ^0612

winks with his eyes, signals with his feet, points with his finger, ^0613

with perverted heart devises evil, continually sowing discord; ^0614

therefore calamity will come upon him suddenly; in a moment he will be broken beyond healing. ^0615

There are six things that the LORD hates, seven that are an abomination to him: ^0616

haughty eyes, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood, ^0617

a heart that devises wicked plans, feet that make haste to run to evil, ^0618

a false witness who breathes out lies, and one who sows discord among brothers. ^0619

My son, keep your father's commandment, and forsake not your mother's teaching. ^0620

Bind them on your heart always; tie them around your neck. ^0621

When you walk, they will lead you; when you lie down, they will watch over you; and when you awake, they will talk with you. ^0622

For the commandment is a lamp and the teaching a light, and the reproofs of discipline are the way of life, ^0623

to preserve you from the evil woman, from the smooth tongue of the adulteress. ^0624

Do not desire her beauty in your heart, and do not let her capture you with her eyelashes; ^0625

for the price of a prostitute is only a loaf of bread, but a married woman hunts down a precious life. ^0626

Can a man carry fire next to his chest and his clothes not be burned? ^0627

Or can one walk on hot coals and his feet not be scorched? ^0628

So is he who goes in to his neighbor's wife; none who touches her will go unpunished. ^0629

People do not despise a thief if he steals to satisfy his appetite when he is hungry, ^0630

but if he is caught, he will pay sevenfold; he will give all the goods of his house. ^0631

He who commits adultery lacks sense; he who does it destroys himself. ^0632

Wounds and dishonor will he get, and his disgrace will not be wiped away. ^0633

For jealousy makes a man furious, and he will not spare when he takes revenge. ^0634

He will accept no compensation; he will refuse though you multiply gifts. ^0635


My son, keep my words and treasure up my commandments with you; ^0701

keep my commandments and live; keep my teaching as the apple of your eye; ^0702

bind them on your fingers; write them on the tablet of your heart. ^0703

Say to wisdom, "You are my sister," and call insight your intimate friend, ^0704

to keep you from the forbidden woman, from the adulteress with her smooth words. ^0705

For at the window of my house I have looked out through my lattice, ^0706

and I have seen among the simple, I have perceived among the youths, a young man lacking sense, ^0707

passing along the street near her corner, taking the road to her house ^0708

in the twilight, in the evening, at the time of night and darkness. ^0709

And behold, the woman meets him, dressed as a prostitute, wily of heart. ^0710

She is loud and wayward; her feet do not stay at home; ^0711

now in the street, now in the market, and at every corner she lies in wait. ^0712

She seizes him and kisses him, and with bold face she says to him, ^0713

"I had to offer sacrifices, and today I have paid my vows; ^0714

so now I have come out to meet you, to seek you eagerly, and I have found you. ^0715

I have spread my couch with coverings, colored linens from Egyptian linen; ^0716

I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. ^0717

Come, let us take our fill of love till morning; let us delight ourselves with love. ^0718

For my husband is not at home; he has gone on a long journey; ^0719

he took a bag of money with him; at full moon he will come home." ^0720

With much seductive speech she persuades him; with her smooth talk she compels him. ^0721

All at once he follows her, as an ox goes to the slaughter, or as a stag is caught fast ^0722

till an arrow pierces its liver; as a bird rushes into a snare; he does not know that it will cost him his life. ^0723

And now, O sons, listen to me, and be attentive to the words of my mouth. ^0724

Let not your heart turn aside to her ways; do not stray into her paths, ^0725

for many a victim has she laid low, and all her slain are a mighty throng. ^0726

Her house is the way to Sheol, going down to the chambers of death. ^0727


Does not wisdom call? Does not understanding raise her voice? ^0801

On the heights beside the way, at the crossroads she takes her stand; ^0802

beside the gates in front of the town, at the entrance of the portals she cries aloud: ^0803

"To you, O men, I call, and my cry is to the children of man. ^0804

O simple ones, learn prudence; O fools, learn sense. ^0805

Hear, for I will speak noble things, and from my lips will come what is right, ^0806

for my mouth will utter truth; wickedness is an abomination to my lips. ^0807

All the words of my mouth are righteous; there is nothing twisted or crooked in them. ^0808

They are all straight to him who understands, and right to those who find knowledge. ^0809

Take my instruction instead of silver, and knowledge rather than choice gold, ^0810

for wisdom is better than jewels, and all that you may desire cannot compare with her. ^0811

"I, wisdom, dwell with prudence, and I find knowledge and discretion. ^0812

The fear of the LORD is hatred of evil. Pride and arrogance and the way of evil and perverted speech I hate. ^0813

I have counsel and sound wisdom; I have insight; I have strength. ^0814

By me kings reign, and rulers decree what is just; ^0815

by me princes rule, and nobles, all who govern justly. ^0816

I love those who love me, and those who seek me diligently find me. ^0817

Riches and honor are with me, enduring wealth and righteousness. ^0818

My fruit is better than gold, even fine gold, and my yield than choice silver. ^0819

I walk in the way of righteousness, in the paths of justice, ^0820

granting an inheritance to those who love me, and filling their treasuries. ^0821

"The LORD possessed me at the beginning of his work, the first of his acts of old. ^0822

Ages ago I was set up, at the first, before the beginning of the earth. ^0823

When there were no depths I was brought forth, when there were no springs abounding with water. ^0824

Before the mountains had been shaped, before the hills, I was brought forth, ^0825

before he had made the earth with its fields, or the first of the dust of the world. ^0826

When he established the heavens, I was there; when he drew a circle on the face of the deep, ^0827

when he made firm the skies above, when he established the fountains of the deep, ^0828

when he assigned to the sea its limit, so that the waters might not transgress his command, when he marked out the foundations of the earth, ^0829

then I was beside him, like a master workman, and I was daily his delight, rejoicing before him always, ^0830

rejoicing in his inhabited world and delighting in the children of man. ^0831

"And now, O sons, listen to me: blessed are those who keep my ways. ^0832

Hear instruction and be wise, and do not neglect it. ^0833

Blessed is the one who listens to me, watching daily at my gates, waiting beside my doors. ^0834

For whoever finds me finds life and obtains favor from the LORD, ^0835

but he who fails to find me injures himself; all who hate me love death." ^0836


Wisdom has built her house; she has hewn her seven pillars. ^0901

She has slaughtered her beasts; she has mixed her wine; she has also set her table. ^0902

She has sent out her young women to call from the highest places in the town, ^0903

"Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!" To him who lacks sense she says, ^0904

"Come, eat of my bread and drink of the wine I have mixed. ^0905

Leave your simple ways, and live, and walk in the way of insight." ^0906

Whoever corrects a scoffer gets himself abuse, and he who reproves a wicked man incurs injury. ^0907

Do not reprove a scoffer, or he will hate you; reprove a wise man, and he will love you. ^0908

Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be still wiser; teach a righteous man, and he will increase in learning. ^0909

The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom, and the knowledge of the Holy One is insight. ^0910

For by me your days will be multiplied, and years will be added to your life. ^0911

If you are wise, you are wise for yourself; if you scoff, you alone will bear it. ^0912

The woman Folly is loud; she is seductive and knows nothing. ^0913

She sits at the door of her house; she takes a seat on the highest places of the town, ^0914

calling to those who pass by, who are going straight on their way, ^0915

"Whoever is simple, let him turn in here!" And to him who lacks sense she says, ^0916

"Stolen water is sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant." ^0917

But he does not know that the dead are there, that her guests are in the depths of Sheol. ^0918


The proverbs of Solomon. A wise son makes a glad father, but a foolish son is a sorrow to his mother. ^1001

Treasures gained by wickedness do not profit, but righteousness delivers from death. ^1002

The LORD does not let the righteous go hungry, but he thwarts the craving of the wicked. ^1003

A slack hand causes poverty, but the hand of the diligent makes rich. ^1004

He who gathers in summer is a prudent son, but he who sleeps in harvest is a son who brings shame. ^1005

Blessings are on the head of the righteous, but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence. ^1006

The memory of the righteous is a blessing, but the name of the wicked will rot. ^1007

The wise of heart will receive commandments, but a babbling fool will come to ruin. ^1008

Whoever walks in integrity walks securely, but he who makes his ways crooked will be found out. ^1009

Whoever winks the eye causes trouble, but a babbling fool will come to ruin. ^1010

The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life, but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence. ^1011

Hatred stirs up strife, but love covers all offenses. ^1012

On the lips of him who has understanding, wisdom is found, but a rod is for the back of him who lacks sense. ^1013

The wise lay up knowledge, but the mouth of a fool brings ruin near. ^1014

A rich man's wealth is his strong city; the poverty of the poor is their ruin. ^1015

The wage of the righteous leads to life, the gain of the wicked to sin. ^1016

Whoever heeds instruction is on the path to life, but he who rejects reproof leads others astray. ^1017

The one who conceals hatred has lying lips, and whoever utters slander is a fool. ^1018

When words are many, transgression is not lacking, but whoever restrains his lips is prudent. ^1019

The tongue of the righteous is choice silver; the heart of the wicked is of little worth. ^1020

The lips of the righteous feed many, but fools die for lack of sense. ^1021

The blessing of the LORD makes rich, and he adds no sorrow with it. ^1022

Doing wrong is like a joke to a fool, but wisdom is pleasure to a man of understanding. ^1023

What the wicked dreads will come upon him, but the desire of the righteous will be granted. ^1024

When the tempest passes, the wicked is no more, but the righteous is established forever. ^1025

Like vinegar to the teeth and smoke to the eyes, so is the sluggard to those who send him. ^1026

The fear of the LORD prolongs life, but the years of the wicked will be short. ^1027

The hope of the righteous brings joy, but the expectation of the wicked will perish. ^1028

The way of the LORD is a stronghold to the blameless, but destruction to evildoers. ^1029

The righteous will never be removed, but the wicked will not dwell in the land. ^1030

The mouth of the righteous brings forth wisdom, but the perverse tongue will be cut off. ^1031

The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable, but the mouth of the wicked, what is perverse. ^1032


A false balance is an abomination to the LORD, but a just weight is his delight. ^1101

When pride comes, then comes disgrace, but with the humble is wisdom. ^1102

The integrity of the upright guides them, but the crookedness of the treacherous destroys them. ^1103

Riches do not profit in the day of wrath, but righteousness delivers from death. ^1104

The righteousness of the blameless keeps his way straight, but the wicked falls by his own wickedness. ^1105

The righteousness of the upright delivers them, but the treacherous are taken captive by their lust. ^1106

When the wicked dies, his hope will perish, and the expectation of wealth perishes too. ^1107

The righteous is delivered from trouble, and the wicked walks into it instead. ^1108

With his mouth the godless man would destroy his neighbor, but by knowledge the righteous are delivered. ^1109

When it goes well with the righteous, the city rejoices, and when the wicked perish there are shouts of gladness. ^1110

By the blessing of the upright a city is exalted, but by the mouth of the wicked it is overthrown. ^1111

Whoever belittles his neighbor lacks sense, but a man of understanding remains silent. ^1112

Whoever goes about slandering reveals secrets, but he who is trustworthy in spirit keeps a thing covered. ^1113

Where there is no guidance, a people falls, but in an abundance of counselors there is safety. ^1114

Whoever puts up security for a stranger will surely suffer harm, but he who hates striking hands in pledge is secure. ^1115

A gracious woman gets honor, and violent men get riches. ^1116

A man who is kind benefits himself, but a cruel man hurts himself. ^1117

The wicked earns deceptive wages, but one who sows righteousness gets a sure reward. ^1118

Whoever is steadfast in righteousness will live, but he who pursues evil will die. ^1119

Those of crooked heart are an abomination to the LORD, but those of blameless ways are his delight. ^1120

Be assured, an evil person will not go unpunished, but the offspring of the righteous will be delivered. ^1121

Like a gold ring in a pig's snout is a beautiful woman without discretion. ^1122

The desire of the righteous ends only in good; the expectation of the wicked in wrath. ^1123

One gives freely, yet grows all the richer; another withholds what he should give, and only suffers want. ^1124

Whoever brings blessing will be enriched, and one who waters will himself be watered. ^1125

The people curse him who holds back grain, but a blessing is on the head of him who sells it. ^1126

Whoever diligently seeks good seeks favor, but evil comes to him who searches for it. ^1127

Whoever trusts in his riches will fall, but the righteous will flourish like a green leaf. ^1128

Whoever troubles his own household will inherit the wind, and the fool will be servant to the wise of heart. ^1129

The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life, and whoever captures souls is wise. ^1130

If the righteous is repaid on earth, how much more the wicked and the sinner! ^1131


Whoever loves discipline loves knowledge, but he who hates reproof is stupid. ^1201

A good man obtains favor from the LORD, but a man of evil devices he condemns. ^1202

No one is established by wickedness, but the root of the righteous will never be moved. ^1203

An excellent wife is the crown of her husband, but she who brings shame is like rottenness in his bones. ^1204

The thoughts of the righteous are just; the counsels of the wicked are deceitful. ^1205

The words of the wicked lie in wait for blood, but the mouth of the upright delivers them. ^1206

The wicked are overthrown and are no more, but the house of the righteous will stand. ^1207

Do you see a man skillful in his work? He will stand before kings; he will not stand before obscure men. ^2229


When you sit down to eat with a ruler, observe carefully what is before you, ^2301

and put a knife to your throat if you are given to appetite. ^2302

Do not desire his delicacies, for they are deceptive food. ^2303

Do not toil to acquire wealth; be discerning enough to desist. ^2304

When your eyes light on it, it is gone, for suddenly it sprouts wings, flying like an eagle toward heaven. ^2305

Do not eat the bread of a man who is stingy; do not desire his delicacies, ^2306

for he is like one who is inwardly calculating. "Eat and drink!" he says to you, but his heart is not with you. ^2307

You will vomit up the morsels that you have eaten, and waste your pleasant words. ^2308

Do not speak in the hearing of a fool, for he will despise the good sense of your words. ^2309

Do not move an ancient landmark or enter the fields of the fatherless, ^2310

for their Redeemer is strong; he will plead their cause against you. ^2311

Apply your heart to instruction and your ear to words of knowledge. ^2312

Do not withhold discipline from a child; if you strike him with a rod, he will not die. ^2313

If you strike him with the rod, you will save his soul from Sheol. ^2314

My son, if your heart is wise, my heart too will be glad. ^2315

My inmost being will exult when your lips speak what is right. ^2316

Let not your heart envy sinners, but continue in the fear of the LORD all the day. ^2317

Surely there is a future, and your hope will not be cut off. ^2318

Hear, my son, and be wise, and direct your heart in the way. ^2319

Be not among drunkards or among gluttonous eaters of meat, ^2320

for the drunkard and the glutton will come to poverty, and slumber will clothe them with rags. ^2321

Listen to your father who gave you life, and do not despise your mother when she is old. ^2322

Buy truth, and do not sell it; buy wisdom, instruction, and understanding. ^2323

The father of the righteous will greatly rejoice; he who fathers a wise son will be glad in him. ^2324

Let your father and mother be glad; let her who bore you rejoice. ^2325

My son, give me your heart, and let your eyes observe my ways. ^2326

For a prostitute is a deep pit; an adulteress is a narrow well. ^2327

She lies in wait like a robber and increases the traitors among mankind. ^2328

Who has woe? Who has sorrow? Who has strife? Who has complaining? Who has wounds without cause? Who has redness of eyes? ^2329

Those who tarry long over wine; those who go to try mixed wine. ^2330

Do not look at wine when it is red, when it sparkles in the cup and goes down smoothly. ^2331

In the end it bites like a serpent and stings like an adder. ^2332

Your eyes will see strange things, and your heart utter perverse things. ^2333

You will be like one who lies down in the midst of the sea, like one who lies on the top of a mast. ^2334

"They struck me," you will say, "but I was not hurt; they beat me, but I did not feel it. When shall I awake? I must have another drink." ^2335


Be not envious of evil men, nor desire to be with them, ^2401

for their hearts devise violence, and their lips talk of trouble. ^2402

By wisdom a house is built, and by understanding it is established; ^2403

by knowledge the rooms are filled with all precious and pleasant riches. ^2404

A wise man is full of strength, and a man of knowledge enhances his might, ^2405

for by wise guidance you can wage your war, and in abundance of counselors there is victory. ^2406

Wisdom is too high for a fool; in the gate he does not open his mouth. ^2407

Whoever plans to do evil will be called a schemer. ^2408

The devising of folly is sin, and the scoffer is an abomination to mankind. ^2409

If you faint in the day of adversity, your strength is small. ^2410

Rescue those who are being taken away to death; hold back those who are stumbling to the slaughter. ^2411

If you say, "Behold, we did not know this," does not he who weighs the heart perceive it? Does not he who keeps watch over your soul know it, and will he not repay man according to his work? ^2412

My son, eat honey, for it is good, and the drippings of the honeycomb are sweet to your taste. ^2413

Know that wisdom is such to your soul; if you find it, there will be a future, and your hope will not be cut off. ^2414

Lie not in wait as a wicked man against the dwelling of the righteous; do no violence to his home; ^2415

for the righteous falls seven times and rises again, but the wicked stumble in times of calamity. ^2416

Do not rejoice when your enemy falls, and let not your heart be glad when he stumbles, ^2417

lest the LORD see it and be displeased, and turn away his anger from him. ^2418

Fret not yourself because of evildoers, and be not envious of the wicked, ^2419

for the evil man has no future; the lamp of the wicked will be put out. ^2420

My son, fear the LORD and the king, and do not join with those who do otherwise, ^2421

for disaster from them will rise suddenly, and who knows the ruin that will come from them both? ^2422

These also are sayings of the wise. Partiality in judging is not good. ^2423

Whoever says to the wicked, "You are in the right," will be cursed by peoples, abhorred by nations, ^2424

but those who rebuke the wicked will have delight, and a good blessing will come upon them. ^2425

Whoever gives an honest answer kisses the lips. ^2426

Prepare your work outside; get everything ready for yourself in the field, and after that build your house. ^2427

Be not a witness against your neighbor without cause, and do not deceive with your lips. ^2428

Do not say, "I will do to him as he has done to me; I will pay the man back for what he has done." ^2429

I passed by the field of a sluggard, by the vineyard of a man lacking sense, ^2430

and behold, it was all overgrown with thorns; the ground was covered with nettles, and its stone wall was broken down. ^2431

Then I saw and considered it; I looked and received instruction. ^2432

A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to rest, ^2433

and poverty will come upon you like a robber, and want like an armed man. ^2434


These also are proverbs of Solomon which the men of Hezekiah king of Judah copied. ^2501

It is the glory of God to conceal things, but the glory of kings is to search things out. ^2502

As the heavens for height, and the earth for depth, so the heart of kings is unsearchable. ^2503

Take away the dross from the silver, and the smith has material for a vessel; ^2504

take away the wicked from the presence of the king, and his throne will be established in righteousness. ^2505

Do not put yourself forward in the king's presence or stand in the place of the great, ^2506

for it is better to be told, "Come up here," than to be put lower in the presence of a noble.What your eyes have seen ^2507

do not hastily bring into court, for what will you do in the end, when your neighbor puts you to shame? ^2508

Argue your case with your neighbor himself, and do not reveal another's secret, ^2509

lest he who hears you bring shame upon you, and your ill repute have no end. ^2510

A word fitly spoken is like apples of gold in a setting of silver. ^2511

Like a gold ring or an ornament of gold is a wise reprover to a listening ear. ^2512

Like the cold of snow in the time of harvest is a faithful messenger to those who send him; he refreshes the soul of his masters. ^2513

Like clouds and wind without rain is a man who boasts of a gift he does not give. ^2514

With patience a ruler may be persuaded, and a soft tongue will break a bone. ^2515

If you have found honey, eat only enough for you, lest you have your fill of it and vomit it. ^2516

Let your foot be seldom in your neighbor's house, lest he have his fill of you and hate you. ^2517

A man who bears false witness against his neighbor is like a war club, or a sword, or a sharp arrow. ^2518

Trusting in a treacherous man in time of trouble is like a bad tooth or a foot that slips. ^2519

Whoever sings songs to a heavy heart is like one who takes off a garment on a cold day, and like vinegar on soda. ^2520

If your enemy is hungry, give him bread to eat, and if he is thirsty, give him water to drink, ^2521

for you will heap burning coals on his head, and the LORD will reward you. ^2522

The north wind brings forth rain, and a backbiting tongue, angry looks. ^2523

It is better to live in a corner of the housetop than in a house shared with a quarrelsome wife. ^2524

Like cold water to a thirsty soul, so is good news from a far country. ^2525

Like a muddied spring or a polluted fountain is a righteous man who gives way before the wicked. ^2526

It is not good to eat much honey, nor is it glorious to seek one's own glory. ^2527

A man without self-control is like a city broken into and left without walls. ^2528


Like snow in summer or rain in harvest, so honor is not fitting for a fool. ^2601

Like a sparrow in its flitting, like a swallow in its flying, a curse that is causeless does not alight. ^2602

A whip for the horse, a bridle for the donkey, and a rod for the back of fools. ^2603

Answer not a fool according to his folly, lest you be like him yourself. ^2604

Answer a fool according to his folly, lest he be wise in his own eyes. ^2605

Whoever sends a message by the hand of a fool cuts off his own feet and drinks violence. ^2606

Like a lame man's legs, which hang useless, is a proverb in the mouth of fools. ^2607

Like one who binds the stone in the sling is one who gives honor to a fool. ^2608

Like a thorn that goes up into the hand of a drunkard is a proverb in the mouth of fools. ^2609

Like an archer who wounds everyone is one who hires a passing fool or drunkard. ^2610

Like a dog that returns to his vomit is a fool who repeats his folly. ^2611

Do you see a man who is wise in his own eyes? There is more hope for a fool than for him. ^2612

The sluggard says, "There is a lion in the road! There is a lion in the streets!" ^2613

As a door turns on its hinges, so does a sluggard on his bed. ^2614

The sluggard buries his hand in the dish; it wears him out to bring it back to his mouth. ^2615

The sluggard is wiser in his own eyes than seven men who can answer sensibly. ^2616

Whoever meddles in a quarrel not his own is like one who takes a passing dog by the ears. ^2617

Like a madman who throws firebrands, arrows, and death ^2618

is the man who deceives his neighbor and says, "I am only joking!" ^2619

For lack of wood the fire goes out, and where there is no whisperer, quarreling ceases. ^2620

As charcoal to hot embers and wood to fire, so is a quarrelsome man for kindling strife. ^2621

The words of a whisperer are like delicious morsels; they go down into the inner parts of the body. ^2622

Like the glaze covering an earthen vessel are fervent lips with an evil heart. ^2623

Whoever hates disguises himself with his lips and harbors deceit in his heart; ^2624

when he speaks graciously, believe him not, for there are seven abominations in his heart; ^2625

though his hatred be covered with deception, his wickedness will be exposed in the assembly. ^2626

Whoever digs a pit will fall into it, and a stone will come back on him who starts it rolling. ^2627

A lying tongue hates its victims, and a flattering mouth works ruin. ^2628


Do not boast about tomorrow, for you do not know what a day may bring. ^2701

Let another praise you, and not your own mouth; a stranger, and not your own lips. ^2702

A stone is heavy, and sand is weighty, but a fool's provocation is heavier than both. ^2703

Wrath is cruel, anger is overwhelming, but who can stand before jealousy? ^2704

Better is open rebuke than hidden love. ^2705

Faithful are the wounds of a friend; profuse are the kisses of an enemy. ^2706

One who is full loathes honey, but to one who is hungry everything bitter is sweet. ^2707

Like a bird that strays from its nest is a man who strays from his home. ^2708

Oil and perfume make the heart glad, and the sweetness of a friend comes from his earnest counsel. ^2709

Do not forsake your friend and your father's friend, and do not go to your brother's house in the day of your calamity. Better is a neighbor who is near than a brother who is far away. ^2710

Be wise, my son, and make my heart glad, that I may answer him who reproaches me. ^2711

The prudent sees danger and hides himself, but the simple go on and suffer for it. ^2712

Take a man's garment when he has put up security for a stranger, and hold it in pledge when he puts up security for an adulteress. ^2713

Whoever blesses his neighbor with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, will be counted as cursing. ^2714

A continual dripping on a rainy day and a quarrelsome wife are alike; ^2715

to restrain her is to restrain the wind or to grasp oil in one's right hand. ^2716

Iron sharpens iron, and one man sharpens another. ^2717

Whoever tends a fig tree will eat its fruit, and he who guards his master will be honored. ^2718

As in water face reflects face, so the heart of man reflects the man. ^2719

Sheol and Abaddon are never satisfied, and never satisfied are the eyes of man. ^2720

The crucible is for silver, and the furnace is for gold, and a man is tested by his praise. ^2721

Crush a fool in a mortar with a pestle along with crushed grain, yet his folly will not depart from him. ^2722

Know well the condition of your flocks, and give attention to your herds, ^2723

for riches do not last forever; and does a crown endure to all generations? ^2724

When the grass is gone and the new growth appears and the vegetation of the mountains is gathered, ^2725

the lambs will provide your clothing, and the goats the price of a field. ^2726

There will be enough goats' milk for your food, for the food of your household and maintenance for your girls. ^2727


The wicked flee when no one pursues, but the righteous are bold as a lion. ^2801

When a land transgresses, it has many rulers, but with a man of understanding and knowledge, its stability will long continue. ^2802

A poor man who oppresses the poor is a beating rain that leaves no food. ^2803

Those who forsake the law praise the wicked, but those who keep the law strive against them. ^2804

Evil men do not understand justice, but those who seek the LORD understand it completely. ^2805

Better is a poor man who walks in his integrity than a rich man who is crooked in his ways. ^2806

The one who keeps the law is a son with understanding, but a companion of gluttons shames his father. ^2807

Whoever multiplies his wealth by interest and profit gathers it for him who is generous to the poor. ^2808

If one turns away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer is an abomination. ^2809

Whoever misleads the upright into an evil way will fall into his own pit, but the blameless will have a goodly inheritance. ^2810

A rich man is wise in his own eyes, but a poor man who has understanding will find him out. ^2811

When the righteous triumph, there is great glory, but when the wicked rise, people hide themselves. ^2812

Whoever conceals his transgressions will not prosper, but he who confesses and forsakes them will obtain mercy. ^2813

Blessed is the one who fears the LORD always, but whoever hardens his heart will fall into calamity. ^2814

Like a roaring lion or a charging bear is a wicked ruler over a poor people. ^2815

A ruler who lacks understanding is a cruel oppressor, but he who hates unjust gain will prolong his days. ^2816

If one is burdened with the blood of another, he will be a fugitive until death; let no one help him. ^2817

Whoever walks in integrity will be delivered, but he who is crooked in his ways will suddenly fall. ^2818

Whoever works his land will have plenty of bread, but he who follows worthless pursuits will have plenty of poverty. ^2819

A faithful man will abound with blessings, but whoever hastens to be rich will not go unpunished. ^2820

To show partiality is not good, but for a piece of bread a man will do wrong. ^2821

A stingy man hastens after wealth and does not know that poverty will come upon him. ^2822

Whoever rebukes a man will afterward find more favor than he who flatters with his tongue. ^2823

Whoever robs his father or his mother and says, "That is no transgression," is a companion to a man who destroys. ^2824

A greedy man stirs up strife, but the one who trusts in the LORD will be enriched. ^2825

Whoever trusts in his own mind is a fool, but he who walks in wisdom will be delivered. ^2826

Whoever gives to the poor will not want, but he who hides his eyes will get many a curse. ^2827

When the wicked rise, people hide themselves, but when they perish, the righteous increase. ^2828


He who is often reproved, yet stiffens his neck, will suddenly be broken beyond healing. ^2901

When the righteous increase, the people rejoice, but when the wicked rule, the people groan. ^2902

He who loves wisdom makes his father glad, but a companion of prostitutes squanders his wealth. ^2903

By justice a king builds up the land, but he who exacts gifts tears it down. ^2904

A man who flatters his neighbor spreads a net for his feet. ^2905

An evil man is ensnared in his transgression, but a righteous man sings and rejoices. ^2906

A righteous man knows the rights of the poor; a wicked man does not understand such knowledge. ^2907

Scoffers set a city aflame, but the wise turn away wrath. ^2908

If a wise man has an argument with a fool, the fool only rages and laughs, and there is no quiet. ^2909

Bloodthirsty men hate one who is blameless and seek the life of the upright. ^2910

A fool gives full vent to his spirit, but a wise man quietly holds it back. ^2911

If a ruler listens to falsehood, all his officials will be wicked. ^2912

The poor man and the oppressor meet together; the LORD gives light to the eyes of both. ^2913

If a king faithfully judges the poor, his throne will be established forever. ^2914

The rod and reproof give wisdom, but a child left to himself brings shame to his mother. ^2915

When the wicked increase, transgression increases, but the righteous will look upon their downfall. ^2916

Discipline your son, and he will give you rest; he will give delight to your heart. ^2917

Where there is no prophetic vision the people cast off restraint, but blessed is he who keeps the law. ^2918

By mere words a servant is not disciplined, for though he understands, he will not respond. ^2919

Do you see a man who is hasty in his words? There is more hope for a fool than for him. ^2920

Whoever pampers his servant from childhood will in the end find him his heir. ^2921

A man of wrath stirs up strife, and one given to anger causes much transgression. ^2922

One's pride will bring him low, but he who is lowly in spirit will obtain honor. ^2923

The partner of a thief hates his own life; he hears the curse, but discloses nothing. ^2924

The fear of man lays a snare, but whoever trusts in the LORD is safe. ^2925

Many seek the face of a ruler, but it is from the LORD that a man gets justice. ^2926

An unjust man is an abomination to the righteous, but one whose way is straight is an abomination to the wicked. ^2927


The words of Agur son of Jakeh. The oracle. The man declares, I am weary, O God; I am weary, O God, and worn out. ^3001

Surely I am too stupid to be a man. I have not the understanding of a man. ^3002

I have not learned wisdom, nor have I knowledge of the Holy One. ^3003

Who has ascended to heaven and come down? Who has gathered the wind in his fists? Who has wrapped up the waters in a garment? Who has established all the ends of the earth? What is his name, and what is his son's name? Surely you know! ^3004

Every word of God proves true; he is a shield to those who take refuge in him. ^3005

Do not add to his words, lest he rebuke you and you be found a liar. ^3006

Two things I ask of you; deny them not to me before I die: ^3007

Remove far from me falsehood and lying; give me neither poverty nor riches; feed me with the food that is needful for me, ^3008

lest I be full and deny you and say, "Who is the LORD?" or lest I be poor and steal and profane the name of my God. ^3009

Do not slander a servant to his master, lest he curse you and you be held guilty. ^3010

There are those who curse their fathers and do not bless their mothers. ^3011

There are those who are clean in their own eyes but are not washed of their filth. ^3012

There are those--how lofty are their eyes, how high their eyelids lift! ^3013

There are those whose teeth are swords, whose fangs are knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, the needy from among mankind. ^3014

The leech has two daughters; "Give" and "Give," they cry. Three things are never satisfied; four never say, "Enough": ^3015

Sheol, the barren womb, the land never satisfied with water, and the fire that never says, "Enough." ^3016

The eye that mocks a father and scorns to obey a mother will be picked out by the ravens of the valley and eaten by the vultures. ^3017

Three things are too wonderful for me; four I do not understand: ^3018

the way of an eagle in the sky, the way of a serpent on a rock, the way of a ship on the high seas, and the way of a man with a virgin. ^3019

This is the way of an adulteress: she eats and wipes her mouth and says, "I have done no wrong." ^3020

Under three things the earth trembles; under four it cannot bear up: ^3021

a slave when he becomes king, and a fool when he is filled with food; ^3022

an unloved woman when she gets a husband, and a maidservant when she displaces her mistress. ^3023

Four things on earth are small, but they are exceedingly wise: ^3024

the ants are a people not strong, yet they provide their food in the summer; ^3025

the rock badgers are a people not mighty, yet they make their homes in the cliffs; ^3026

the locusts have no king, yet all of them march in rank; ^3027

the lizard you can take in your hands, yet it is in kings' palaces. ^3028

Three things are stately in their tread; four are stately in their stride: ^3029

the lion, which is mightiest among beasts and does not turn back before any; ^3030

the strutting rooster, the he-goat, and a king whose army is with him. ^3031

If you have been foolish, exalting yourself, or if you have been devising evil, put your hand on your mouth. ^3032

For pressing milk produces curds, pressing the nose produces blood, and pressing anger produces strife. ^3033


The words of King Lemuel. An oracle that his mother taught him: ^3101

What are you doing, my son? What are you doing, son of my womb? What are you doing, son of my vows? ^3102

Do not give your strength to women, your ways to those who destroy kings. ^3103

It is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine, or for rulers to take strong drink, ^3104

lest they drink and forget what has been decreed and pervert the rights of all the afflicted. ^3105

Give strong drink to the one who is perishing, and wine to those in bitter distress; ^3106

let them drink and forget their poverty and remember their misery no more. ^3107

Open your mouth for the mute, for the rights of all who are destitute. ^3108

Open your mouth, judge righteously, defend the rights of the poor and needy. ^3109

An excellent wife who can find? She is far more precious than jewels. ^3110

The heart of her husband trusts in her, and he will have no lack of gain. ^3111

She does him good, and not harm, all the days of her life. ^3112

She seeks wool and flax, and works with willing hands. ^3113

She is like the ships of the merchant; she brings her food from afar. ^3114

She rises while it is yet night and provides food for her household and portions for her maidens. ^3115

She considers a field and buys it; with the fruit of her hands she plants a vineyard. ^3116

She dresses herself with strength and makes her arms strong. ^3117

She perceives that her merchandise is profitable. Her lamp does not go out at night. ^3118

She puts her hands to the distaff, and her hands hold the spindle. ^3119

She opens her hand to the poor and reaches out her hands to the needy. ^3120

She is not afraid of snow for her household, for all her household are clothed in scarlet. ^3121

She makes bed coverings for herself; her clothing is fine linen and purple. ^3122

Her husband is known in the gates when he sits among the elders of the land. ^3123

She makes linen garments and sells them; she delivers sashes to the merchant. ^3124

Strength and dignity are her clothing, and she laughs at the time to come. ^3125

She opens her mouth with wisdom, and the teaching of kindness is on her tongue. ^3126

She looks well to the ways of her household and does not eat the bread of idleness. ^3127

Her children rise up and call her blessed; her husband also, and he praises her: ^3128

"Many women have done excellently, but you surpass them all." ^3129

Charm is deceitful, and beauty is vain, but a woman who fears the LORD is to be praised. ^3130

Give her of the fruit of her hands, and let her works praise her in the gates. ^3131
