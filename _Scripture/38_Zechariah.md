In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of the Lord came to the prophet Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, son of Iddo, saying, ^0101

The Lord was very angry with your fathers. ^0102

Therefore say to them, Thus declares the Lord of hosts : Return to me, says the Lord of hosts, and I will return to you, says the Lord of hosts. ^0103

Do not be like your fathers, to whom the former prophets cried out, Thus says the Lord of hosts, Return from your evil ways and from your evil deeds. But they did not hear or pay attention to me, declares the Lord. ^0104

Your fathers, where are they? And the prophets, do they live forever? ^0105

But my words and my statutes, which I commanded my servants the prophets, did they not overtake your fathers? So they repented and said, As the Lord of hosts purposed to deal with us for our ways and deeds, so has he dealt with us. ^0106

On the twenty-fourth day of the eleventh month, which is the month of Shebat, in the second year of Darius, the word of the Lord came to the prophet Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, son of Iddo, saying, ^0107

I saw in the night, and behold, a man riding on a red horse! He was standing among the myrtle trees in the glen, and behind him were red, sorrel, and white horses. ^0108

Then I said, What are these, my lord? The angel who talked with me said to me, I will show you what they are. ^0109

So the man who was standing among the myrtle trees answered, These are they whom the Lord has sent to patrol the earth. ^0110

And they answered the angel of the Lord who was standing among the myrtle trees, and said, We have patrolled the earth, and behold, all the earth remains at rest. ^0111

Then the angel of the Lord said, O Lord of hosts, how long will you have no mercy on Jerusalem and the cities of Judah, against which you have been angry these seventy years? ^0112

And the Lord answered gracious and comforting words to the angel who talked with me. ^0113

So the angel who talked with me said to me, Cry out, Thus says the Lord of hosts : I am exceedingly jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion. ^0114

And I am exceedingly angry with the nations that are at ease; for while I was angry but a little, they furthered the disaster. ^0115

Therefore, thus says the Lord, I have returned to Jerusalem with mercy; my house shall be built in it, declares the Lord of hosts, and the measuring line shall be stretched out over Jerusalem. ^0116

Cry out again, Thus says the Lord of hosts : My cities shall again overflow with prosperity, and the Lord will again comfort Zion and again choose Jerusalem. ^0117

And I lifted my eyes and saw, and behold, four horns! ^0118

And I said to the angel who talked with me, What are these? And he said to me, These are the horns that have scattered Judah, Israel, and Jerusalem. ^0119

Then the Lord showed me four craftsmen. ^0120

And I said, What are these coming to do? He said, These are the horns that scattered Judah, so that no one raised his head. And these have come to terrify them, to cast down the horns of the nations who lifted up their horns against the land of Judah to scatter it. ^0121



And I lifted my eyes and saw, and behold, a man with a measuring line in his hand! ^0201

Then I said, Where are you going? And he said to me, To measure Jerusalem, to see what is its width and what is its length. ^0202

And behold, the angel who talked with me came forward, and another angel came forward to meet him ^0203

and said to him, Run, say to that young man, Jerusalem shall be inhabited as villages without walls, because of the multitude of people and livestock in it. ^0204

And I will be to her a wall of fire all around, declares the Lord, and I will be the glory in her midst. ^0205

Up! Up! Flee from the land of the north, declares the Lord. For I have spread you abroad as the four winds of the heavens, declares the Lord. ^0206

Up! Escape to Zion, you who dwell with the daughter of Babylon. ^0207

For thus said the Lord of hosts, after his glory sent me to the nations who plundered you, for he who touches you touches the apple of his eye : ^0208

Behold, I will shake my hand over them, and they shall become plunder for those who served them. Then you will know that the Lord of hosts has sent me. ^0209

Sing and rejoice, O daughter of Zion, for behold, I come and I will dwell in your midst, declares the Lord. ^0210

And many nations shall join themselves to the Lord in that day, and shall be my people. And I will dwell in your midst, and you shall know that the Lord of hosts has sent me to you. ^0211

And the Lord will inherit Judah as his portion in the holy land, and will again choose Jerusalem. ^0212

Be silent, all flesh, before the Lord, for he has roused himself from his holy dwelling. ^0213



Then he showed me Joshua the high priest standing before the angel of the Lord, and Satan standing at his right hand to accuse him. ^0301

And the Lord said to Satan, The Lord rebuke you, O Satan! The Lord who has chosen Jerusalem rebuke you! Is not this a brand plucked from the fire? ^0302

Now Joshua was standing before the angel, clothed with filthy garments. ^0303

And the angel said to those who were standing before him, Remove the filthy garments from him. And to him he said, Behold, I have taken your iniquity away from you, and I will clothe you with pure vestments. ^0304

And I said, Let them put a clean turban on his head. So they put a clean turban on his head and clothed him with garments. And the angel of the Lord was standing by. ^0305

And the angel of the Lord solemnly assured Joshua, ^0306

Thus says the Lord of hosts : If you will walk in my ways and keep my charge, then you shall rule my house and have charge of my courts, and I will give you the right of access among those who are standing here. ^0307

Hear now, O Joshua the high priest, you and your friends who sit before you, for they are men who are a sign : behold, I will bring my servant the Branch. ^0308

For behold, on the stone that I have set before Joshua, on a single stone with seven eyes, I will engrave its inscription, declares the Lord of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of this land in a single day. ^0309

In that day, declares the Lord of hosts, every one of you will invite his neighbor to come under his vine and under his fig tree. ^0310



And the angel who talked with me came again and woke me, like a man who is awakened out of his sleep. ^0401

And he said to me, What do you see? I said, I see, and behold, a lampstand all of gold, with a bowl on the top of it, and seven lamps on it, with seven lips on each of the lamps that are on the top of it. ^0402

And there are two olive trees by it, one on the right of the bowl and the other on its left. ^0403

And I said to the angel who talked with me, What are these, my lord? ^0404

Then the angel who talked with me answered and said to me, Do you not know what these are? I said, No, my lord. ^0405

Then he said to me, This is the word of the Lord to Zerubbabel : Not by might, nor by power, but by my Spirit, says the Lord of hosts. ^0406

Who are you, O great mountain? Before Zerubbabel you shall become a plain. And he shall bring forward the top stone amid shouts of Grace, grace to it! ^0407

Then the word of the Lord came to me, saying, ^0408

The hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house; his hands shall also complete it. Then you will know that the Lord of hosts has sent me to you. ^0409

For whoever has despised the day of small things shall rejoice, and shall see the plumb line in the hand of Zerubbabel. These seven are the eyes of the Lord, which range through the whole earth. ^0410

Then I said to him, What are these two olive trees on the right and the left of the lampstand? ^0411

And a second time I answered and said to him, What are these two branches of the olive trees, which are beside the two golden pipes from which the golden oil is poured out? ^0412

He said to me, Do you not know what these are? I said, No, my lord. ^0413

Then he said, These are the two anointed ones who stand by the Lord of the whole earth. ^0414



Again I lifted my eyes and saw, and behold, a flying scroll! ^0501

And he said to me, What do you see? I answered, I see a flying scroll. Its length is twenty cubits, and its width ten cubits. ^0502

Then he said to me, This is the curse that goes out over the face of the whole land. For everyone who steals shall be cleaned out according to what is on one side, and everyone who swears falsely shall be cleaned out according to what is on the other side. ^0503

I will send it out, declares the Lord of hosts, and it shall enter the house of the thief, and the house of him who swears falsely by my name. And it shall remain in his house and consume it, both timber and stones. ^0504

Then the angel who talked with me came forward and said to me, Lift your eyes and see what this is that is going out. ^0505

And I said, What is it? He said, This is the basket that is going out. And he said, This is their iniquity in all the land. ^0506

And behold, the leaden cover was lifted, and there was a woman sitting in the basket! ^0507

And he said, This is Wickedness. And he thrust her back into the basket, and thrust down the leaden weight on its opening. ^0508

Then I lifted my eyes and saw, and behold, two women coming forward! The wind was in their wings. They had wings like the wings of a stork, and they lifted up the basket between earth and heaven. ^0509

Then I said to the angel who talked with me, Where are they taking the basket? ^0510

He said to me, To the land of Shinar, to build a house for it. And when this is prepared, they will set the basket down there on its base. ^0511



Again I lifted my eyes and saw, and behold, four chariots came out from between two mountains. And the mountains were mountains of bronze. ^0601

The first chariot had red horses, the second black horses, ^0602

the third white horses, and the fourth chariot dappled horses —all of them strong. ^0603

Then I answered and said to the angel who talked with me, What are these, my lord? ^0604

And the angel answered and said to me, These are going out to the four winds of heaven, after presenting themselves before the Lord of all the earth. ^0605

The chariot with the black horses goes toward the north country, the white ones go after them, and the dappled ones go toward the south country. ^0606

When the strong horses came out, they were impatient to go and patrol the earth. And he said, Go, patrol the earth. So they patrolled the earth. ^0607

Then he cried to me, Behold, those who go toward the north country have set my Spirit at rest in the north country. ^0608

And the word of the Lord came to me: ^0609

Take from the exiles Heldai, Tobijah, and Jedaiah, who have arrived from Babylon, and go the same day to the house of Josiah, the son of Zephaniah. ^0610

Take from them silver and gold, and make a crown, and set it on the head of Joshua, the son of Jehozadak, the high priest. ^0611

And say to him, Thus says the Lord of hosts, Behold, the man whose name is the Branch : for he shall branch out from his place, and he shall build the temple of the Lord. ^0612

It is he who shall build the temple of the Lord and shall bear royal honor, and shall sit and rule on his throne. And there shall be a priest on his throne, and the counsel of peace shall be between them both. ^0613

And the crown shall be in the temple of the Lord as a reminder to Helem, Tobijah, Jedaiah, and Hen the son of Zephaniah. ^0614

And those who are far off shall come and help to build the temple of the Lord. And you shall know that the Lord of hosts has sent me to you. And this shall come to pass, if you will diligently obey the voice of the Lord your God. ^0615



In the fourth year of King Darius, the word of the Lord came to Zechariah on the fourth day of the ninth month, which is Chislev. ^0701

Now the people of Bethel had sent Sharezer and Regem-melech and their men to entreat the favor of the Lord, ^0702

saying to the priests of the house of the Lord of hosts and the prophets, Should I weep and abstain in the fifth month, as I have done for so many years? ^0703

Then the word of the Lord of hosts came to me: ^0704

Say to all the people of the land and the priests, When you fasted and mourned in the fifth month and in the seventh, for these seventy years, was it for me that you fasted? ^0705

And when you eat and when you drink, do you not eat for yourselves and drink for yourselves? ^0706

Were not these the words that the Lord proclaimed by the former prophets, when Jerusalem was inhabited and prosperous, with her cities around her, and the South and the lowland were inhabited? ^0707

And the word of the Lord came to Zechariah, saying, ^0708

Thus says the Lord of hosts, Render true judgments, show kindness and mercy to one another, ^0709

do not oppress the widow, the fatherless, the sojourner, or the poor, and let none of you devise evil against another in your heart. ^0710

But they refused to pay attention and turned a stubborn shoulder and stopped their ears that they might not hear. ^0711

They made their hearts diamond-hard lest they should hear the law and the words that the Lord of hosts had sent by his Spirit through the former prophets. Therefore great anger came from the Lord of hosts. ^0712

As I called, and they would not hear, so they called, and I would not hear, says the Lord of hosts, ^0713

and I scattered them with a whirlwind among all the nations that they had not known. Thus the land they left was desolate, so that no one went to and fro, and the pleasant land was made desolate. ^0714



And the word of the Lord of hosts came, saying, ^0801

Thus says the Lord of hosts : I am jealous for Zion with great jealousy, and I am jealous for her with great wrath. ^0802

Thus says the Lord : I have returned to Zion and will dwell in the midst of Jerusalem, and Jerusalem shall be called the faithful city, and the mountain of the Lord of hosts, the holy mountain. ^0803

Thus says the Lord of hosts : Old men and old women shall again sit in the streets of Jerusalem, each with staff in hand because of great age. ^0804

And the streets of the city shall be full of boys and girls playing in its streets. ^0805

Thus says the Lord of hosts : If it is marvelous in the sight of the remnant of this people in those days, should it also be marvelous in my sight, declares the Lord of hosts? ^0806

Thus says the Lord of hosts : Behold, I will save my people from the east country and from the west country, ^0807

and I will bring them to dwell in the midst of Jerusalem. And they shall be my people, and I will be their God, in faithfulness and in righteousness. ^0808

Thus says the Lord of hosts : Let your hands be strong, you who in these days have been hearing these words from the mouth of the prophets who were present on the day that the foundation of the house of the Lord of hosts was laid, that the temple might be built. ^0809

For before those days there was no wage for man or any wage for beast, neither was there any safety from the foe for him who went out or came in, for I set every man against his neighbor. ^0810

But now I will not deal with the remnant of this people as in the former days, declares the Lord of hosts. ^0811

For there shall be a sowing of peace. The vine shall give its fruit, and the ground shall give its produce, and the heavens shall give their dew. And I will cause the remnant of this people to possess all these things. ^0812

And as you have been a byword of cursing among the nations, O house of Judah and house of Israel, so will I save you, and you shall be a blessing. Fear not, but let your hands be strong. ^0813

For thus says the Lord of hosts : As I purposed to bring disaster to you when your fathers provoked me to wrath, and I did not relent, says the Lord of hosts, ^0814

so again have I purposed in these days to bring good to Jerusalem and to the house of Judah; fear not. ^0815

These are the things that you shall do : Speak the truth to one another; render in your gates judgments that are true and make for peace; ^0816

do not devise evil in your hearts against one another, and love no false oath, for all these things I hate, declares the Lord. ^0817

And the word of the Lord of hosts came to me, saying, ^0818

Thus says the Lord of hosts : The fast of the fourth month and the fast of the fifth and the fast of the seventh and the fast of the tenth shall be to the house of Judah seasons of joy and gladness and cheerful feasts. Therefore love truth and peace. ^0819

Thus says the Lord of hosts : Peoples shall yet come, even the inhabitants of many cities. ^0820

The inhabitants of one city shall go to another, saying, Let us go at once to entreat the favor of the Lord and to seek the Lord of hosts; I myself am going. ^0821

Many peoples and strong nations shall come to seek the Lord of hosts in Jerusalem and to entreat the favor of the Lord. ^0822

Thus says the Lord of hosts : In those days ten men from the nations of every tongue shall take hold of the robe of a Jew, saying, Let us go with you, for we have heard that God is with you. ^0823



The oracle of the word of the Lord is against the land of Hadrach and Damascus is its resting place. For the Lord has an eye on mankind and on all the tribes of Israel, ^0901

and on Hamath also, which borders on it, Tyre and Sidon, though they are very wise. ^0902

Tyre has built herself a rampart and heaped up silver like dust, and fine gold like the mud of the streets. ^0903

But behold, the Lord will strip her of her possessions and strike down her power on the sea, and she shall be devoured by fire. ^0904

Ashkelon shall see it, and be afraid; Gaza too, and shall writhe in anguish; Ekron also, because its hopes are confounded. The king shall perish from Gaza; Ashkelon shall be uninhabited; ^0905

a mixed people shall dwell in Ashdod, and I will cut off the pride of Philistia. ^0906

I will take away its blood from its mouth, and its abominations from between its teeth; it too shall be a remnant for our God; it shall be like a clan in Judah, and Ekron shall be like the Jebusites. ^0907

Then I will encamp at my house as a guard, so that none shall march to and fro; no oppressor shall again march over them, for now I see with my own eyes. ^0908

Rejoice greatly, O daughter of Zion! Shout aloud, O daughter of Jerusalem! Behold, your king is coming to you; righteous and having salvation is he, humble and mounted on a donkey, on a colt, the foal of a donkey. ^0909

I will cut off the chariot from Ephraim and the war horse from Jerusalem; and the battle bow shall be cut off, and he shall speak peace to the nations; his rule shall be from sea to sea, and from the River to the ends of the earth. ^0910

As for you also, because of the blood of my covenant with you, I will set your prisoners free from the waterless pit. ^0911

Return to your stronghold, O prisoners of hope; today I declare that I will restore to you double. ^0912

For I have bent Judah as my bow; I have made Ephraim its arrow. I will stir up your sons, O Zion, against your sons, O Greece, and wield you like a warrior’s sword. ^0913

Then the Lord will appear over them, and his arrow will go forth like lightning; the Lord God will sound the trumpet and will march forth in the whirlwinds of the south. ^0914

The Lord of hosts will protect them, and they shall devour, and tread down the sling stones, and they shall drink and roar as if drunk with wine, and be full like a bowl, drenched like the corners of the altar. ^0915

On that day the Lord their God will save them, as the flock of his people; for like the jewels of a crown they shall shine on his land. ^0916

For how great is his goodness, and how great his beauty! Grain shall make the young men flourish, and new wine the young women. ^0917



Ask rain from the Lord in the season of the spring rain, from the Lord who makes the storm clouds, and he will give them showers of rain, to everyone the vegetation in the field. ^1001

For the household gods utter nonsense, and the diviners see lies; they tell false dreams and give empty consolation. Therefore the people wander like sheep; they are afflicted for lack of a shepherd. ^1002

My anger is hot against the shepherds, and I will punish the leaders; for the Lord of hosts cares for his flock, the house of Judah, and will make them like his majestic steed in battle. ^1003

From him shall come the cornerstone, from him the tent peg, from him the battle bow, from him every ruler — all of them together. ^1004

They shall be like mighty men in battle, trampling the foe in the mud of the streets; they shall fight because the Lord is with them, and they shall put to shame the riders on horses. ^1005

I will strengthen the house of Judah, and I will save the house of Joseph. I will bring them back because I have compassion on them, and they shall be as though I had not rejected them, for I am the Lord their God and I will answer them. ^1006

Then Ephraim shall become like a mighty warrior, and their hearts shall be glad as with wine. Their children shall see it and be glad; their hearts shall rejoice in the Lord. ^1007

I will whistle for them and gather them in, for I have redeemed them, and they shall be as many as they were before. ^1008

Though I scattered them among the nations, yet in far countries they shall remember me, and with their children they shall live and return. ^1009

I will bring them home from the land of Egypt, and gather them from Assyria, and I will bring them to the land of Gilead and to Lebanon, till there is no room for them. ^1010

He shall pass through the sea of troubles and strike down the waves of the sea, and all the depths of the Nile shall be dried up. The pride of Assyria shall be laid low, and the scepter of Egypt shall depart. ^1011

I will make them strong in the Lord, and they shall walk in his name, declares the Lord. ^1012



Open your doors, O Lebanon, that the fire may devour your cedars! ^1101

Wail, O cypress, for the cedar has fallen, for the glorious trees are ruined! Wail, oaks of Bashan, for the thick forest has been felled! ^1102

The sound of the wail of the shepherds, for their glory is ruined! The sound of the roar of the lions, for the thicket of the Jordan is ruined! ^1103

Thus said the Lord my God : Become shepherd of the flock doomed to slaughter. ^1104

Those who buy them slaughter them and go unpunished, and those who sell them say, Blessed be the Lord, I have become rich, and their own shepherds have no pity on them. ^1105

For I will no longer have pity on the inhabitants of this land, declares the Lord. Behold, I will cause each of them to fall into the hand of his neighbor, and each into the hand of his king, and they shall crush the land, and I will deliver none from their hand. ^1106

So I became the shepherd of the flock doomed to be slaughtered by the sheep traders. And I took two staffs, one I named Favor, the other I named Union. And I tended the sheep. ^1107

In one month I destroyed the three shepherds. But I became impatient with them, and they also detested me. ^1108

So I said, I will not be your shepherd. What is to die, let it die. What is to be destroyed, let it be destroyed. And let those who are left devour the flesh of one another. ^1109

And I took my staff Favor, and I broke it, annulling the covenant that I had made with all the peoples. ^1110

So it was annulled on that day, and the sheep traders, who were watching me, knew that it was the word of the Lord. ^1111

Then I said to them, If it seems good to you, give me my wages; but if not, keep them. And they weighed out as my wages thirty pieces of silver. ^1112

Then the Lord said to me, Throw it to the potter — the lordly price at which I was priced by them. So I took the thirty pieces of silver and threw them into the house of the Lord, to the potter. ^1113

Then I broke my second staff Union, annulling the brotherhood between Judah and Israel. ^1114

Then the Lord said to me, Take once more the equipment of a foolish shepherd. ^1115

For behold, I am raising up in the land a shepherd who does not care for those being destroyed, or seek the young or heal the maimed or nourish the healthy, but devours the flesh of the fat ones, tearing off even their hoofs. ^1116

Woe to my worthless shepherd, who deserts the flock! May the sword strike his arm and his right eye! Let his arm be wholly withered, his right eye utterly blinded! ^1117



The oracle of the word of the Lord concerning Israel : Thus declares the Lord, who stretched out the heavens and founded the earth and formed the spirit of man within him: ^1201

Behold, I am about to make Jerusalem a cup of staggering to all the surrounding peoples. The siege of Jerusalem will also be against Judah. ^1202

On that day I will make Jerusalem a heavy stone for all the peoples. All who lift it will surely hurt themselves. And all the nations of the earth will gather against it. ^1203

On that day, declares the Lord, I will strike every horse with panic, and its rider with madness. But for the sake of the house of Judah I will keep my eyes open, when I strike every horse of the peoples with blindness. ^1204

Then the clans of Judah shall say to themselves, The inhabitants of Jerusalem have strength through the Lord of hosts, their God. ^1205

On that day I will make the clans of Judah like a blazing pot in the midst of wood, like a flaming torch among sheaves. And they shall devour to the right and to the left all the surrounding peoples, while Jerusalem shall again be inhabited in its place, in Jerusalem. ^1206

And the Lord will give salvation to the tents of Judah first, that the glory of the house of David and the glory of the inhabitants of Jerusalem may not surpass that of Judah. ^1207

On that day the Lord will protect the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the feeblest among them on that day shall be like David, and the house of David shall be like God, like the angel of the Lord, going before them. ^1208

And on that day I will seek to destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem. ^1209

And I will pour out on the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem a spirit of grace and pleas for mercy, so that, when they look on me, on him whom they have pierced, they shall mourn for him, as one mourns for an only child, and weep bitterly over him, as one weeps over a firstborn. ^1210

On that day the mourning in Jerusalem will be as great as the mourning for Hadad-rimmon in the plain of Megiddo. ^1211

The land shall mourn, each family by itself : the family of the house of David by itself, and their wives by themselves; the family of the house of Nathan by itself, and their wives by themselves; ^1212

the family of the house of Levi by itself, and their wives by themselves; the family of the Shimeites by itself, and their wives by themselves; ^1213

and all the families that are left, each by itself, and their wives by themselves. ^1214



On that day there shall be a fountain opened for the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, to cleanse them from sin and uncleanness. ^1301

And on that day, declares the Lord of hosts, I will cut off the names of the idols from the land, so that they shall be remembered no more. And also I will remove from the land the prophets and the spirit of uncleanness. ^1302

And if anyone again prophesies, his father and mother who bore him will say to him, You shall not live, for you speak lies in the name of the Lord. And his father and mother who bore him shall pierce him through when he prophesies. ^1303

On that day every prophet will be ashamed of his vision when he prophesies. He will not put on a hairy cloak in order to deceive, ^1304

but he will say, I am no prophet, I am a worker of the soil, for a man sold me in my youth. ^1305

And if one asks him, What are these wounds on your back? he will say, The wounds I received in the house of my friends. ^1306

Awake, O sword, against my shepherd, against the man who stands next to me, declares the Lord of hosts. Strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered; I will turn my hand against the little ones. ^1307

In the whole land, declares the Lord, two thirds shall be cut off and perish, and one third shall be left alive. ^1308

And I will put this third into the fire, and refine them as one refines silver, and test them as gold is tested. They will call upon my name, and I will answer them. I will say, They are my people; and they will say, The Lord is my God. ^1309



Behold, a day is coming for the Lord, when the spoil taken from you will be divided in your midst. ^1401

For I will gather all the nations against Jerusalem to battle, and the city shall be taken and the houses plundered and the women raped. Half of the city shall go out into exile, but the rest of the people shall not be cut off from the city. ^1402

Then the Lord will go out and fight against those nations as when he fights on a day of battle. ^1403

On that day his feet shall stand on the Mount of Olives that lies before Jerusalem on the east, and the Mount of Olives shall be split in two from east to west by a very wide valley, so that one half of the Mount shall move northward, and the other half southward. ^1404

And you shall flee to the valley of my mountains, for the valley of the mountains shall reach to Azal. And you shall flee as you fled from the earthquake in the days of Uzziah king of Judah. Then the Lord my God will come, and all the holy ones with him. ^1405

On that day there shall be no light, cold, or frost. ^1406

And there shall be a unique day, which is known to the Lord, neither day nor night, but at evening time there shall be light. ^1407

On that day living waters shall flow out from Jerusalem, half of them to the eastern sea and half of them to the western sea. It shall continue in summer as in winter. ^1408

And the Lord will be king over all the earth. On that day the Lord will be one and his name one. ^1409

The whole land shall be turned into a plain from Geba to Rimmon south of Jerusalem. But Jerusalem shall remain aloft on its site from the Gate of Benjamin to the place of the former gate, to the Corner Gate, and from the Tower of Hananel to the king’s winepresses. ^1410

And it shall be inhabited, for there shall never again be a decree of utter destruction. Jerusalem shall dwell in security. ^1411

And this shall be the plague with which the Lord will strike all the peoples that wage war against Jerusalem : their flesh will rot while they are still standing on their feet, their eyes will rot in their sockets, and their tongues will rot in their mouths. ^1412

And on that day a great panic from the Lord shall fall on them, so that each will seize the hand of another, and the hand of the one will be raised against the hand of the other. ^1413

Even Judah will fight at Jerusalem. And the wealth of all the surrounding nations shall be collected, gold, silver, and garments in great abundance. ^1414

And a plague like this plague shall fall on the horses, the mules, the camels, the donkeys, and whatever beasts may be in those camps. ^1415

Then everyone who survives of all the nations that have come against Jerusalem shall go up year after year to worship the King, the Lord of hosts, and to keep the Feast of Booths. ^1416

And if any of the families of the earth do not go up to Jerusalem to worship the King, the Lord of hosts, there will be no rain on them. ^1417

And if the family of Egypt does not go up and present themselves, then on them there shall be no rain; there shall be the plague with which the Lord afflicts the nations that do not go up to keep the Feast of Booths. ^1418

This shall be the punishment to Egypt and the punishment to all the nations that do not go up to keep the Feast of Booths. ^1419

And on that day there shall be inscribed on the bells of the horses, Holy to the Lord. And the pots in the house of the Lord shall be as the bowls before the altar. ^1420

And every pot in Jerusalem and Judah shall be holy to the Lord of hosts, so that all who sacrifice may come and take of them and boil the meat of the sacrifice in them. And there shall no longer be a trader in the house of the Lord of hosts on that day. ^1421
