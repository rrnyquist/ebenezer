Paul, a prisoner for Christ Jesus, and Timothy our brother,To Philemon our beloved fellow worker ^0101

and Apphia our sister and Archippus our fellow soldier, and the church in your house: ^0102

Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. ^0103

I thank my God always when I remember you in my prayers, ^0104

because I hear of your love and of the faith that you have toward the Lord Jesus and all the saints, ^0105

and I pray that the sharing of your faith may become effective for the full knowledge of every good thing that is in us for the sake of Christ. ^0106

For I have derived much joy and comfort from your love, my brother, because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed through you. ^0107

Accordingly, though I am bold enough in Christ to command you to do what is required, ^0108

yet for love's sake I prefer to appeal to you--I, Paul, an old man and now a prisoner also for Christ Jesus-- ^0109

I appeal to you for my child, Onesimus, whose father I became in my imprisonment. ^0110

(Formerly he was useless to you, but now he is indeed useful to you and to me.) ^0111

I am sending him back to you, sending my very heart. ^0112

I would have been glad to keep him with me, in order that he might serve me on your behalf during my imprisonment for the gospel, ^0113

but I preferred to do nothing without your consent in order that your goodness might not be by compulsion but of your own free will. ^0114

For this perhaps is why he was parted from you for a while, that you might have him back forever, ^0115

no longer as a slave but more than a slave, as a beloved brother--especially to me, but how much more to you, both in the flesh and in the Lord. ^0116

So if you consider me your partner, receive him as you would receive me. ^0117

If he has wronged you at all, or owes you anything, charge that to my account. ^0118

I, Paul, write this with my own hand: I will repay it--to say nothing of your owing me even your own self. ^0119

Yes, brother, I want some benefit from you in the Lord. Refresh my heart in Christ. ^0120

Confident of your obedience, I write to you, knowing that you will do even more than I say. ^0121

At the same time, prepare a guest room for me, for I am hoping that through your prayers I will be graciously given to you. ^0122

Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus, sends greetings to you, ^0123

and so do Mark, Aristarchus, Demas, and Luke, my fellow workers. ^0124

The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ be with your spirit. ^0125
