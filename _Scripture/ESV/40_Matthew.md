The book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham. ^0101

Abraham was the father of Isaac, and Isaac the father of Jacob, and Jacob the father of Judah and his brothers, ^0102

and Judah the father of Perez and Zerah by Tamar, and Perez the father of Hezron, and Hezron the father of Ram, ^0103

and Ram the father of Amminadab, and Amminadab the father of Nahshon, and Nahshon the father of Salmon, ^0104

and Salmon the father of Boaz by Rahab, and Boaz the father of Obed by Ruth, and Obed the father of Jesse, ^0105

and Jesse the father of David the king.And David was the father of Solomon by the wife of Uriah, ^0106

and Solomon the father of Rehoboam, and Rehoboam the father of Abijah, and Abijah the father of Asaph, ^0107

and Asaph the father of Jehoshaphat, and Jehoshaphat the father of Joram, and Joram the father of Uzziah, ^0108

and Uzziah the father of Jotham, and Jotham the father of Ahaz, and Ahaz the father of Hezekiah, ^0109

and Hezekiah the father of Manasseh, and Manasseh the father of Amos, and Amos the father of Josiah, ^0110

and Josiah the father of Jechoniah and his brothers, at the time of the deportation to Babylon. ^0111

And after the deportation to Babylon: Jechoniah was the father of Shealtiel, and Shealtiel the father of Zerubbabel, ^0112

and Zerubbabel the father of Abiud, and Abiud the father of Eliakim, and Eliakim the father of Azor, ^0113

and Azor the father of Zadok, and Zadok the father of Achim, and Achim the father of Eliud, ^0114

and Eliud the father of Eleazar, and Eleazar the father of Matthan, and Matthan the father of Jacob, ^0115

and Jacob the father of Joseph the husband of Mary, of whom Jesus was born, who is called Christ. ^0116

So all the generations from Abraham to David were fourteen generations, and from David to the deportation to Babylon fourteen generations, and from the deportation to Babylon to the Christ fourteen generations. ^0117

Now the birth of Jesus Christ took place in this way. When his mother Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together she was found to be with child from the Holy Spirit. ^0118

And her husband Joseph, being a just man and unwilling to put her to shame, resolved to divorce her quietly. ^0119

But as he considered these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, son of David, do not fear to take Mary as your wife, for that which is conceived in her is from the Holy Spirit. ^0120

She will bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins. ^0121

All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet: ^0122

Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel(which means, God with us). ^0123

When Joseph woke from sleep, he did as the angel of the Lord commanded him: he took his wife, ^0124

but knew her not until she had given birth to a son. And he called his name Jesus. ^0125


Now after Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea in the days of Herod the king, behold, wise men from the east came to Jerusalem, ^0201

saying, Where is he who has been born king of the Jews? For we saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him. ^0202

When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him; ^0203

and assembling all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he inquired of them where the Christ was to be born. ^0204

They told him, In Bethlehem of Judea, for so it is written by the prophet: ^0205

'And you, O Bethlehem, in the land of Judah, are by no means least among the rulers of Judah; for from you shall come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel.' ^0206

Then Herod summoned the wise men secretly and ascertained from them what time the star had appeared. ^0207

And he sent them to Bethlehem, saying, Go and search diligently for the child, and when you have found him, bring me word, that I too may come and worship him. ^0208

After listening to the king, they went on their way. And behold, the star that they had seen when it rose went before them until it came to rest over the place where the child was. ^0209

When they saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy. ^0210

And going into the house they saw the child with Mary his mother, and they fell down and worshiped him. Then, opening their treasures, they offered him gifts, gold and frankincense and myrrh. ^0211

And being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed to their own country by another way. ^0212

Now when they had departed, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, Rise, take the child and his mother, and flee to Egypt, and remain there until I tell you, for Herod is about to search for the child, to destroy him. ^0213

And he rose and took the child and his mother by night and departed to Egypt ^0214

and remained there until the death of Herod. This was to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet, Out of Egypt I called my son. ^0215

Then Herod, when he saw that he had been tricked by the wise men, became furious, and he sent and killed all the male children in Bethlehem and in all that region who were two years old or under, according to the time that he had ascertained from the wise men. ^0216

Then was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah: ^0217

A voice was heard in Ramah, weeping and loud lamentation, Rachel weeping for her children; she refused to be comforted, because they are no more. ^0218

But when Herod died, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt, ^0219

saying, Rise, take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel, for those who sought the child's life are dead. ^0220

And he rose and took the child and his mother and went to the land of Israel. ^0221

But when he heard that Archelaus was reigning over Judea in place of his father Herod, he was afraid to go there, and being warned in a dream he withdrew to the district of Galilee. ^0222

And he went and lived in a city called Nazareth, that what was spoken by the prophets might be fulfilled: He shall be called a Nazarene. ^0223


In those days John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea, ^0301

Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. ^0302

For this is he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah when he said, The voice of one crying in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way of the Lord; make his paths straight.' ^0303

Now John wore a garment of camel's hair and a leather belt around his waist, and his food was locusts and wild honey. ^0304

Then Jerusalem and all Judea and all the region about the Jordan were going out to him, ^0305

and they were baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins. ^0306

But when he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming for baptism, he said to them, You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the wrath to come? ^0307

Bear fruit in keeping with repentance. ^0308

And do not presume to say to yourselves, 'We have Abraham as our father,' for I tell you, God is able from these stones to raise up children for Abraham. ^0309

Even now the axe is laid to the root of the trees. Every tree therefore that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. ^0310

I baptize you with water for repentance, but he who is coming after me is mightier than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and with fire. ^0311

His winnowing fork is in his hand, and he will clear his threshing floor and gather his wheat into the barn, but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire. ^0312

Then Jesus came from Galilee to the Jordan to John, to be baptized by him. ^0313

John would have prevented him, saying, I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me? ^0314

But Jesus answered him, Let it be so now, for thus it is fitting for us to fulfill all righteousness. Then he consented. ^0315

And when Jesus was baptized, immediately he went up from the water, and behold, the heavens were opened to him, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and coming to rest on him; ^0316

and behold, a voice from heaven said, This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased. ^0317


Then Jesus was led up by the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted by the devil. ^0401

And after fasting forty days and forty nights, he was hungry. ^0402

And the tempter came and said to him, If you are the Son of God, command these stones to become loaves of bread. ^0403

But he answered, It is written, 'Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God.' ^0404

Then the devil took him to the holy city and set him on the pinnacle of the temple ^0405

and said to him, If you are the Son of God, throw yourself down, for it is written, 'He will command his angels concerning you,'and 'On their hands they will bear you up, lest you strike your foot against a stone.' ^0406

Jesus said to him, Again it is written, 'You shall not put the Lord your God to the test.' ^0407

Again, the devil took him to a very high mountain and showed him all the kingdoms of the world and their glory. ^0408

And he said to him, All these I will give you, if you will fall down and worship me. ^0409

Then Jesus said to him, Be gone, Satan! For it is written, 'You shall worship the Lord your God and him only shall you serve.' ^0410

Then the devil left him, and behold, angels came and were ministering to him. ^0411

Now when he heard that John had been arrested, he withdrew into Galilee. ^0412

And leaving Nazareth he went and lived in Capernaum by the sea, in the territory of Zebulun and Naphtali, ^0413

so that what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah might be fulfilled: ^0414

The land of Zebulun and the land of Naphtali, the way of the sea, beyond the Jordan, Galilee of the Gentiles-- ^0415

the people dwelling in darkness have seen a great light, and for those dwelling in the region and shadow of death, on them a light has dawned. ^0416

From that time Jesus began to preach, saying, Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. ^0417

While walking by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon (who is called Peter) and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen. ^0418

And he said to them, Follow me, and I will make you fishers of men. ^0419

Immediately they left their nets and followed him. ^0420

And going on from there he saw two other brothers, James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, in the boat with Zebedee their father, mending their nets, and he called them. ^0421

Immediately they left the boat and their father and followed him. ^0422

And he went throughout all Galilee, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom and healing every disease and every affliction among the people. ^0423

So his fame spread throughout all Syria, and they brought him all the sick, those afflicted with various diseases and pains, those oppressed by demons, epileptics, and paralytics, and he healed them. ^0424

And great crowds followed him from Galilee and the Decapolis, and from Jerusalem and Judea, and from beyond the Jordan. ^0425


Seeing the crowds, he went up on the mountain, and when he sat down, his disciples came to him. ^0501

And he opened his mouth and taught them, saying: ^0502

Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. ^0503

Blessed are those who mourn, for they shall be comforted. ^0504

Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth. ^0505

Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied. ^0506

Blessed are the merciful, for they shall receive mercy. ^0507

Blessed are the pure in heart, for they shall see God. ^0508

Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God. ^0509

Blessed are those who are persecuted for righteousness' sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. ^0510

Blessed are you when others revile you and persecute you and utter all kinds of evil against you falsely on my account. ^0511

Rejoice and be glad, for your reward is great in heaven, for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you. ^0512

You are the salt of the earth, but if salt has lost its taste, how shall its saltiness be restored? It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled under people's feet. ^0513

You are the light of the world. A city set on a hill cannot be hidden. ^0514

Nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a stand, and it gives light to all in the house. ^0515

In the same way, let your light shine before others, so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven. ^0516

Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. ^0517

For truly, I say to you, until heaven and earth pass away, not an iota, not a dot, will pass from the Law until all is accomplished. ^0518

Therefore whoever relaxes one of the least of these commandments and teaches others to do the same will be called least in the kingdom of heaven, but whoever does them and teaches them will be called great in the kingdom of heaven. ^0519

For I tell you, unless your righteousness exceeds that of the scribes and Pharisees, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. ^0520

You have heard that it was said to those of old, 'You shall not murder; and whoever murders will be liable to judgment.' ^0521

But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment; whoever insults his brother will be liable to the council; and whoever says, 'You fool!' will be liable to the hell of fire. ^0522

So if you are offering your gift at the altar and there remember that your brother has something against you, ^0523

leave your gift there before the altar and go. First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift. ^0524

Come to terms quickly with your accuser while you are going with him to court, lest your accuser hand you over to the judge, and the judge to the guard, and you be put in prison. ^0525

Truly, I say to you, you will never get out until you have paid the last penny. ^0526

You have heard that it was said, 'You shall not commit adultery.' ^0527

But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart. ^0528

If your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away. For it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body be thrown into hell. ^0529

And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. For it is better that you lose one of your members than that your whole body go into hell. ^0530

It was also said, 'Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce.' ^0531

But I say to you that everyone who divorces his wife, except on the ground of sexual immorality, makes her commit adultery. And whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery. ^0532

Again you have heard that it was said to those of old, 'You shall not swear falsely, but shall perform to the Lord what you have sworn.' ^0533

But I say to you, Do not take an oath at all, either by heaven, for it is the throne of God, ^0534

or by the earth, for it is his footstool, or by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great King. ^0535

And do not take an oath by your head, for you cannot make one hair white or black. ^0536

Let what you say be simply 'Yes' or 'No'; anything more than this comes from evil. ^0537

You have heard that it was said, 'An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.' ^0538

But I say to you, Do not resist the one who is evil. But if anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn to him the other also. ^0539

And if anyone would sue you and take your tunic, let him have your cloak as well. ^0540

And if anyone forces you to go one mile, go with him two miles. ^0541

Give to the one who begs from you, and do not refuse the one who would borrow from you. ^0542

You have heard that it was said, 'You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.' ^0543

But I say to you, Love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, ^0544

so that you may be sons of your Father who is in heaven. For he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust. ^0545

For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have? Do not even the tax collectors do the same? ^0546

And if you greet only your brothers, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same? ^0547

You therefore must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect. ^0548


Beware of practicing your righteousness before other people in order to be seen by them, for then you will have no reward from your Father who is in heaven. ^0601

Thus, when you give to the needy, sound no trumpet before you, as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may be praised by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward. ^0602

But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing, ^0603

so that your giving may be in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you. ^0604

And when you pray, you must not be like the hypocrites. For they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners, that they may be seen by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward. ^0605

But when you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you. ^0606

And when you pray, do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do, for they think that they will be heard for their many words. ^0607

Do not be like them, for your Father knows what you need before you ask him. ^0608

Pray then like this: Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name. ^0609

Your kingdom come, your will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. ^0610

Give us this day our daily bread, ^0611

and forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors. ^0612

And lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. ^0613

For if you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you, ^0614

but if you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses. ^0615

And when you fast, do not look gloomy like the hypocrites, for they disfigure their faces that their fasting may be seen by others. Truly, I say to you, they have received their reward. ^0616

But when you fast, anoint your head and wash your face, ^0617

that your fasting may not be seen by others but by your Father who is in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you. ^0618

Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal, ^0619

but lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. ^0620

For where your treasure is, there your heart will be also. ^0621

The eye is the lamp of the body. So, if your eye is healthy, your whole body will be full of light, ^0622

but if your eye is bad, your whole body will be full of darkness. If then the light in you is darkness, how great is the darkness! ^0623

No one can serve two masters, for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money. ^0624

Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat or what you will drink, nor about your body, what you will put on. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing? ^0625

Look at the birds of the air: they neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they? ^0626

And which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his span of life? ^0627

And why are you anxious about clothing? Consider the lilies of the field, how they grow: they neither toil nor spin, ^0628

yet I tell you, even Solomon in all his glory was not arrayed like one of these. ^0629

But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which today is alive and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith? ^0630

Therefore do not be anxious, saying, 'What shall we eat?' or 'What shall we drink?' or 'What shall we wear?' ^0631

For the Gentiles seek after all these things, and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all. ^0632

But seek first the kingdom of God and his righteousness, and all these things will be added to you. ^0633

Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow, for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble. ^0634


Judge not, that you be not judged. ^0701

For with the judgment you pronounce you will be judged, and with the measure you use it will be measured to you. ^0702

Why do you see the speck that is in your brother's eye, but do not notice the log that is in your own eye? ^0703

Or how can you say to your brother, 'Let me take the speck out of your eye,' when there is the log in your own eye? ^0704

You hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye. ^0705

Do not give dogs what is holy, and do not throw your pearls before pigs, lest they trample them underfoot and turn to attack you. ^0706

Ask, and it will be given to you; seek, and you will find; knock, and it will be opened to you. ^0707

For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds, and to the one who knocks it will be opened. ^0708

Or which one of you, if his son asks him for bread, will give him a stone? ^0709

Or if he asks for a fish, will give him a serpent? ^0710

If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more will your Father who is in heaven give good things to those who ask him! ^0711

So whatever you wish that others would do to you, do also to them, for this is the Law and the Prophets. ^0712

Enter by the narrow gate. For the gate is wide and the way is easy that leads to destruction, and those who enter by it are many. ^0713

For the gate is narrow and the way is hard that leads to life, and those who find it are few. ^0714

Beware of false prophets, who come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves. ^0715

You will recognize them by their fruits. Are grapes gathered from thornbushes, or figs from thistles? ^0716

So, every healthy tree bears good fruit, but the diseased tree bears bad fruit. ^0717

A healthy tree cannot bear bad fruit, nor can a diseased tree bear good fruit. ^0718

Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire. ^0719

Thus you will recognize them by their fruits. ^0720

Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. ^0721

On that day many will say to me, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name, and cast out demons in your name, and do many mighty works in your name?' ^0722

And then will I declare to them, 'I never knew you; depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.' ^0723

Everyone then who hears these words of mine and does them will be like a wise man who built his house on the rock. ^0724

And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat on that house, but it did not fall, because it had been founded on the rock. ^0725

And everyone who hears these words of mine and does not do them will be like a foolish man who built his house on the sand. ^0726

And the rain fell, and the floods came, and the winds blew and beat against that house, and it fell, and great was the fall of it. ^0727

And when Jesus finished these sayings, the crowds were astonished at his teaching, ^0728

for he was teaching them as one who had authority, and not as their scribes. ^0729


When he came down from the mountain, great crowds followed him. ^0801

And behold, a leper came to him and knelt before him, saying, Lord, if you will, you can make me clean. ^0802

And Jesus stretched out his hand and touched him, saying, I will; be clean. And immediately his leprosy was cleansed. ^0803

And Jesus said to him, See that you say nothing to anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer the gift that Moses commanded, for a proof to them. ^0804

When he entered Capernaum, a centurion came forward to him, appealing to him, ^0805

Lord, my servant is lying paralyzed at home, suffering terribly. ^0806

And he said to him, I will come and heal him. ^0807

But the centurion replied, Lord, I am not worthy to have you come under my roof, but only say the word, and my servant will be healed. ^0808

For I too am a man under authority, with soldiers under me. And I say to one, 'Go,' and he goes, and to another, 'Come,' and he comes, and to my servant, 'Do this,' and he does it. ^0809

When Jesus heard this, he marveled and said to those who followed him, Truly, I tell you, with no one in Israel have I found such faith. ^0810

I tell you, many will come from east and west and recline at table with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven, ^0811

while the sons of the kingdom will be thrown into the outer darkness. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. ^0812

And to the centurion Jesus said, Go; let it be done for you as you have believed. And the servant was healed at that very moment. ^0813

And when Jesus entered Peter's house, he saw his mother-in-law lying sick with a fever. ^0814

He touched her hand, and the fever left her, and she rose and began to serve him. ^0815

That evening they brought to him many who were oppressed by demons, and he cast out the spirits with a word and healed all who were sick. ^0816

This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah: He took our illnesses and bore our diseases. ^0817

Now when Jesus saw a great crowd around him, he gave orders to go over to the other side. ^0818

And a scribe came up and said to him, Teacher, I will follow you wherever you go. ^0819

And Jesus said to him, Foxes have holes, and birds of the air have nests, but the Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head. ^0820

Another of the disciples said to him, Lord, let me first go and bury my father. ^0821

And Jesus said to him, Follow me, and leave the dead to bury their own dead. ^0822

And when he got into the boat, his disciples followed him. ^0823

And behold, there arose a great storm on the sea, so that the boat was being swamped by the waves; but he was asleep. ^0824

And they went and woke him, saying, Save us, Lord; we are perishing. ^0825

And he said to them, Why are you afraid, O you of little faith? Then he rose and rebuked the winds and the sea, and there was a great calm. ^0826

And the men marveled, saying, What sort of man is this, that even winds and sea obey him? ^0827

And when he came to the other side, to the country of the Gadarenes, two demon-possessed men met him, coming out of the tombs, so fierce that no one could pass that way. ^0828

And behold, they cried out, What have you to do with us, O Son of God? Have you come here to torment us before the time? ^0829

Now a herd of many pigs was feeding at some distance from them. ^0830

And the demons begged him, saying, If you cast us out, send us away into the herd of pigs. ^0831

And he said to them, Go. So they came out and went into the pigs, and behold, the whole herd rushed down the steep bank into the sea and drowned in the waters. ^0832

The herdsmen fled, and going into the city they told everything, especially what had happened to the demon-possessed men. ^0833

And behold, all the city came out to meet Jesus, and when they saw him, they begged him to leave their region. ^0834


And getting into a boat he crossed over and came to his own city. ^0901

And behold, some people brought to him a paralytic, lying on a bed. And when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, Take heart, my son; your sins are forgiven. ^0902

And behold, some of the scribes said to themselves, This man is blaspheming. ^0903

But Jesus, knowing their thoughts, said, Why do you think evil in your hearts? ^0904

For which is easier, to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Rise and walk'? ^0905

But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins--he then said to the paralytic--Rise, pick up your bed and go home. ^0906

And he rose and went home. ^0907

When the crowds saw it, they were afraid, and they glorified God, who had given such authority to men. ^0908

As Jesus passed on from there, he saw a man called Matthew sitting at the tax booth, and he said to him, Follow me. And he rose and followed him. ^0909

And as Jesus reclined at table in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and were reclining with Jesus and his disciples. ^0910

And when the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners? ^0911

But when he heard it, he said, Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. ^0912

Go and learn what this means, 'I desire mercy, and not sacrifice.' For I came not to call the righteous, but sinners. ^0913

Then the disciples of John came to him, saying, Why do we and the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast? ^0914

And Jesus said to them, Can the wedding guests mourn as long as the bridegroom is with them? The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast. ^0915

No one puts a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment, for the patch tears away from the garment, and a worse tear is made. ^0916

Neither is new wine put into old wineskins. If it is, the skins burst and the wine is spilled and the skins are destroyed. But new wine is put into fresh wineskins, and so both are preserved. ^0917

While he was saying these things to them, behold, a ruler came in and knelt before him, saying, My daughter has just died, but come and lay your hand on her, and she will live. ^0918

And Jesus rose and followed him, with his disciples. ^0919

And behold, a woman who had suffered from a discharge of blood for twelve years came up behind him and touched the fringe of his garment, ^0920

for she said to herself, If I only touch his garment, I will be made well. ^0921

Jesus turned, and seeing her he said, Take heart, daughter; your faith has made you well. And instantly the woman was made well. ^0922

And when Jesus came to the ruler's house and saw the flute players and the crowd making a commotion, ^0923

he said, Go away, for the girl is not dead but sleeping. And they laughed at him. ^0924

But when the crowd had been put outside, he went in and took her by the hand, and the girl arose. ^0925

And the report of this went through all that district. ^0926

And as Jesus passed on from there, two blind men followed him, crying aloud, Have mercy on us, Son of David. ^0927

When he entered the house, the blind men came to him, and Jesus said to them, Do you believe that I am able to do this? They said to him, Yes, Lord. ^0928

Then he touched their eyes, saying, According to your faith be it done to you. ^0929

And their eyes were opened. And Jesus sternly warned them, See that no one knows about it. ^0930

But they went away and spread his fame through all that district. ^0931

As they were going away, behold, a demon-oppressed man who was mute was brought to him. ^0932

And when the demon had been cast out, the mute man spoke. And the crowds marveled, saying, Never was anything like this seen in Israel. ^0933

But the Pharisees said, He casts out demons by the prince of demons. ^0934

And Jesus went throughout all the cities and villages, teaching in their synagogues and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom and healing every disease and every affliction. ^0935

When he saw the crowds, he had compassion for them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep without a shepherd. ^0936

Then he said to his disciples, The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few; ^0937

therefore pray earnestly to the Lord of the harvest to send out laborers into his harvest. ^0938


And he called to him his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits, to cast them out, and to heal every disease and every affliction. ^1001

The names of the twelve apostles are these: first, Simon, who is called Peter, and Andrew his brother; James the son of Zebedee, and John his brother; ^1002

Philip and Bartholomew; Thomas and Matthew the tax collector; James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus; ^1003

Simon the Cananaean, and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him. ^1004

These twelve Jesus sent out, instructing them, Go nowhere among the Gentiles and enter no town of the Samaritans, ^1005

but go rather to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. ^1006

And proclaim as you go, saying, 'The kingdom of heaven is at hand.' ^1007

Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse lepers, cast out demons. You received without paying; give without pay. ^1008

Acquire no gold nor silver nor copper for your belts, ^1009

no bag for your journey, nor two tunics nor sandals nor a staff, for the laborer deserves his food. ^1010

And whatever town or village you enter, find out who is worthy in it and stay there until you depart. ^1011

As you enter the house, greet it. ^1012

And if the house is worthy, let your peace come upon it, but if it is not worthy, let your peace return to you. ^1013

And if anyone will not receive you or listen to your words, shake off the dust from your feet when you leave that house or town. ^1014

Truly, I say to you, it will be more bearable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom and Gomorrah than for that town. ^1015

Behold, I am sending you out as sheep in the midst of wolves, so be wise as serpents and innocent as doves. ^1016

Beware of men, for they will deliver you over to courts and flog you in their synagogues, ^1017

and you will be dragged before governors and kings for my sake, to bear witness before them and the Gentiles. ^1018

When they deliver you over, do not be anxious how you are to speak or what you are to say, for what you are to say will be given to you in that hour. ^1019

For it is not you who speak, but the Spirit of your Father speaking through you. ^1020

Brother will deliver brother over to death, and the father his child, and children will rise against parents and have them put to death, ^1021

and you will be hated by all for my name's sake. But the one who endures to the end will be saved. ^1022

When they persecute you in one town, flee to the next, for truly, I say to you, you will not have gone through all the towns of Israel before the Son of Man comes. ^1023

A disciple is not above his teacher, nor a servant above his master. ^1024

It is enough for the disciple to be like his teacher, and the servant like his master. If they have called the master of the house Beelzebul, how much more will they malign those of his household. ^1025

So have no fear of them, for nothing is covered that will not be revealed, or hidden that will not be known. ^1026

What I tell you in the dark, say in the light, and what you hear whispered, proclaim on the housetops. ^1027

And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. Rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell. ^1028

Are not two sparrows sold for a penny? And not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father. ^1029

But even the hairs of your head are all numbered. ^1030

Fear not, therefore; you are of more value than many sparrows. ^1031

So everyone who acknowledges me before men, I also will acknowledge before my Father who is in heaven, ^1032

but whoever denies me before men, I also will deny before my Father who is in heaven. ^1033

Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword. ^1034

For I have come to set a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law. ^1035

And a person's enemies will be those of his own household. ^1036

Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me, and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. ^1037

And whoever does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me. ^1038

Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it. ^1039

Whoever receives you receives me, and whoever receives me receives him who sent me. ^1040

The one who receives a prophet because he is a prophet will receive a prophet's reward, and the one who receives a righteous person because he is a righteous person will receive a righteous person's reward. ^1041

And whoever gives one of these little ones even a cup of cold water because he is a disciple, truly, I say to you, he will by no means lose his reward. ^1042


When Jesus had finished instructing his twelve disciples, he went on from there to teach and preach in their cities. ^1101

Now when John heard in prison about the deeds of the Christ, he sent word by his disciples ^1102

and said to him, Are you the one who is to come, or shall we look for another? ^1103

And Jesus answered them, Go and tell John what you hear and see: ^1104

the blind receive their sight and the lame walk, lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear, and the dead are raised up, and the poor have good news preached to them. ^1105

And blessed is the one who is not offended by me. ^1106

As they went away, Jesus began to speak to the crowds concerning John: What did you go out into the wilderness to see? A reed shaken by the wind? ^1107

What then did you go out to see? A man dressed in soft clothing? Behold, those who wear soft clothing are in kings' houses. ^1108

What then did you go out to see? A prophet? Yes, I tell you, and more than a prophet. ^1109

This is he of whom it is written, 'Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way before you.' ^1110

Truly, I say to you, among those born of women there has arisen no one greater than John the Baptist. Yet the one who is least in the kingdom of heaven is greater than he. ^1111

From the days of John the Baptist until now the kingdom of heaven has suffered violence, and the violent take it by force. ^1112

For all the Prophets and the Law prophesied until John, ^1113

and if you are willing to accept it, he is Elijah who is to come. ^1114

He who has ears to hear, let him hear. ^1115

But to what shall I compare this generation? It is like children sitting in the marketplaces and calling to their playmates, ^1116

'We played the flute for you, and you did not dance; we sang a dirge, and you did not mourn.' ^1117

For John came neither eating nor drinking, and they say, 'He has a demon.' ^1118

The Son of Man came eating and drinking, and they say, 'Look at him! A glutton and a drunkard, a friend of tax collectors and sinners!' Yet wisdom is justified by her deeds. ^1119

Then he began to denounce the cities where most of his mighty works had been done, because they did not repent. ^1120

Woe to you, Chorazin! Woe to you, Bethsaida! For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Tyre and Sidon, they would have repented long ago in sackcloth and ashes. ^1121

But I tell you, it will be more bearable on the day of judgment for Tyre and Sidon than for you. ^1122

And you, Capernaum, will you be exalted to heaven? You will be brought down to Hades. For if the mighty works done in you had been done in Sodom, it would have remained until this day. ^1123

But I tell you that it will be more tolerable on the day of judgment for the land of Sodom than for you. ^1124

At that time Jesus declared, I thank you, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and understanding and revealed them to little children; ^1125

yes, Father, for such was your gracious will. ^1126

All things have been handed over to me by my Father, and no one knows the Son except the Father, and no one knows the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the Son chooses to reveal him. ^1127

Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. ^1128

Take my yoke upon you, and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. ^1129

For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light. ^1130


At that time Jesus went through the grainfields on the Sabbath. His disciples were hungry, and they began to pluck heads of grain and to eat. ^1201

But when the Pharisees saw it, they said to him, Look, your disciples are doing what is not lawful to do on the Sabbath. ^1202

He said to them, Have you not read what David did when he was hungry, and those who were with him: ^1203

how he entered the house of God and ate the bread of the Presence, which it was not lawful for him to eat nor for those who were with him, but only for the priests? ^1204

Or have you not read in the Law how on the Sabbath the priests in the temple profane the Sabbath and are guiltless? ^1205

I tell you, something greater than the temple is here. ^1206

And if you had known what this means, 'I desire mercy, and not sacrifice,' you would not have condemned the guiltless. ^1207

For the Son of Man is lord of the Sabbath. ^1208

He went on from there and entered their synagogue. ^1209

And a man was there with a withered hand. And they asked him, Is it lawful to heal on the Sabbath?--so that they might accuse him. ^1210

He said to them, Which one of you who has a sheep, if it falls into a pit on the Sabbath, will not take hold of it and lift it out? ^1211

Of how much more value is a man than a sheep! So it is lawful to do good on the Sabbath. ^1212

Then he said to the man, Stretch out your hand. And the man stretched it out, and it was restored, healthy like the other. ^1213

But the Pharisees went out and conspired against him, how to destroy him. ^1214

Jesus, aware of this, withdrew from there. And many followed him, and he healed them all ^1215

and ordered them not to make him known. ^1216

This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet Isaiah: ^1217

Behold, my servant whom I have chosen, my beloved with whom my soul is well pleased. I will put my Spirit upon him, and he will proclaim justice to the Gentiles. ^1218

He will not quarrel or cry aloud, nor will anyone hear his voice in the streets; ^1219

a bruised reed he will not break, and a smoldering wick he will not quench, until he brings justice to victory; ^1220

and in his name the Gentiles will hope. ^1221

Then a demon-oppressed man who was blind and mute was brought to him, and he healed him, so that the man spoke and saw. ^1222

And all the people were amazed, and said, Can this be the Son of David? ^1223

But when the Pharisees heard it, they said, It is only by Beelzebul, the prince of demons, that this man casts out demons. ^1224

Knowing their thoughts, he said to them, Every kingdom divided against itself is laid waste, and no city or house divided against itself will stand. ^1225

And if Satan casts out Satan, he is divided against himself. How then will his kingdom stand? ^1226

And if I cast out demons by Beelzebul, by whom do your sons cast them out? Therefore they will be your judges. ^1227

But if it is by the Spirit of God that I cast out demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you. ^1228

Or how can someone enter a strong man's house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man? Then indeed he may plunder his house. ^1229

Whoever is not with me is against me, and whoever does not gather with me scatters. ^1230

Therefore I tell you, every sin and blasphemy will be forgiven people, but the blasphemy against the Spirit will not be forgiven. ^1231

And whoever speaks a word against the Son of Man will be forgiven, but whoever speaks against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either in this age or in the age to come. ^1232

Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree bad and its fruit bad, for the tree is known by its fruit. ^1233

You brood of vipers! How can you speak good, when you are evil? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. ^1234

The good person out of his good treasure brings forth good, and the evil person out of his evil treasure brings forth evil. ^1235

I tell you, on the day of judgment people will give account for every careless word they speak, ^1236

for by your words you will be justified, and by your words you will be condemned. ^1237

Then some of the scribes and Pharisees answered him, saying, Teacher, we wish to see a sign from you. ^1238

But he answered them, An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of the prophet Jonah. ^1239

For just as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the great fish, so will the Son of Man be three days and three nights in the heart of the earth. ^1240

The men of Nineveh will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for they repented at the preaching of Jonah, and behold, something greater than Jonah is here. ^1241

The queen of the South will rise up at the judgment with this generation and condemn it, for she came from the ends of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and behold, something greater than Solomon is here. ^1242

When the unclean spirit has gone out of a person, it passes through waterless places seeking rest, but finds none. ^1243

Then it says, 'I will return to my house from which I came.' And when it comes, it finds the house empty, swept, and put in order. ^1244

Then it goes and brings with it seven other spirits more evil than itself, and they enter and dwell there, and the last state of that person is worse than the first. So also will it be with this evil generation. ^1245

While he was still speaking to the people, behold, his mother and his brothers stood outside, asking to speak to him. ^1246

But he replied to the man who told him, Who is my mother, and who are my brothers? ^1248

And stretching out his hand toward his disciples, he said, Here are my mother and my brothers! ^1249

For whoever does the will of my Father in heaven is my brother and sister and mother. ^1250


That same day Jesus went out of the house and sat beside the sea. ^1301

And great crowds gathered about him, so that he got into a boat and sat down. And the whole crowd stood on the beach. ^1302

And he told them many things in parables, saying: A sower went out to sow. ^1303

And as he sowed, some seeds fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured them. ^1304

Other seeds fell on rocky ground, where they did not have much soil, and immediately they sprang up, since they had no depth of soil, ^1305

but when the sun rose they were scorched. And since they had no root, they withered away. ^1306

Other seeds fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked them. ^1307

Other seeds fell on good soil and produced grain, some a hundredfold, some sixty, some thirty. ^1308

He who has ears, let him hear. ^1309

Then the disciples came and said to him, Why do you speak to them in parables? ^1310

And he answered them, To you it has been given to know the secrets of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it has not been given. ^1311

For to the one who has, more will be given, and he will have an abundance, but from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away. ^1312

This is why I speak to them in parables, because seeing they do not see, and hearing they do not hear, nor do they understand. ^1313

Indeed, in their case the prophecy of Isaiah is fulfilled that says: 'You will indeed hear but never understand, and you will indeed see but never perceive. ^1314

For this people's heart has grown dull, and with their ears they can barely hear, and their eyes they have closed, lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and turn, and I would heal them.' ^1315

But blessed are your eyes, for they see, and your ears, for they hear. ^1316

Truly, I say to you, many prophets and righteous people longed to see what you see, and did not see it, and to hear what you hear, and did not hear it. ^1317

Hear then the parable of the sower: ^1318

When anyone hears the word of the kingdom and does not understand it, the evil one comes and snatches away what has been sown in his heart. This is what was sown along the path. ^1319

As for what was sown on rocky ground, this is the one who hears the word and immediately receives it with joy, ^1320

yet he has no root in himself, but endures for a while, and when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word, immediately he falls away. ^1321

As for what was sown among thorns, this is the one who hears the word, but the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches choke the word, and it proves unfruitful. ^1322

As for what was sown on good soil, this is the one who hears the word and understands it. He indeed bears fruit and yields, in one case a hundredfold, in another sixty, and in another thirty. ^1323

He put another parable before them, saying, The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a man who sowed good seed in his field, ^1324

but while his men were sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat and went away. ^1325

So when the plants came up and bore grain, then the weeds appeared also. ^1326

And the servants of the master of the house came and said to him, 'Master, did you not sow good seed in your field? How then does it have weeds?' ^1327

He said to them, 'An enemy has done this.' So the servants said to him, 'Then do you want us to go and gather them?' ^1328

But he said, 'No, lest in gathering the weeds you root up the wheat along with them. ^1329

Let both grow together until the harvest, and at harvest time I will tell the reapers, Gather the weeds first and bind them in bundles to be burned, but gather the wheat into my barn.' ^1330

He put another parable before them, saying, The kingdom of heaven is like a grain of mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his field. ^1331

It is the smallest of all seeds, but when it has grown it is larger than all the garden plants and becomes a tree, so that the birds of the air come and make nests in its branches. ^1332

He told them another parable. The kingdom of heaven is like leaven that a woman took and hid in three measures of flour, till it was all leavened. ^1333

All these things Jesus said to the crowds in parables; indeed, he said nothing to them without a parable. ^1334

This was to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet: I will open my mouth in parables; I will utter what has been hidden since the foundation of the world. ^1335

Then he left the crowds and went into the house. And his disciples came to him, saying, Explain to us the parable of the weeds of the field. ^1336

He answered, The one who sows the good seed is the Son of Man. ^1337

The field is the world, and the good seed is the children of the kingdom. The weeds are the sons of the evil one, ^1338

and the enemy who sowed them is the devil. The harvest is the close of the age, and the reapers are angels. ^1339

Just as the weeds are gathered and burned with fire, so will it be at the close of the age. ^1340

The Son of Man will send his angels, and they will gather out of his kingdom all causes of sin and all law-breakers, ^1341

and throw them into the fiery furnace. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. ^1342

Then the righteous will shine like the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears, let him hear. ^1343

The kingdom of heaven is like treasure hidden in a field, which a man found and covered up. Then in his joy he goes and sells all that he has and buys that field. ^1344

Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a merchant in search of fine pearls, ^1345

who, on finding one pearl of great value, went and sold all that he had and bought it. ^1346

Again, the kingdom of heaven is like a net that was thrown into the sea and gathered fish of every kind. ^1347

When it was full, men drew it ashore and sat down and sorted the good into containers but threw away the bad. ^1348

So it will be at the close of the age. The angels will come out and separate the evil from the righteous ^1349

and throw them into the fiery furnace. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. ^1350

Have you understood all these things? They said to him, Yes. ^1351

And he said to them, Therefore every scribe who has been trained for the kingdom of heaven is like a master of a house, who brings out of his treasure what is new and what is old. ^1352

And when Jesus had finished these parables, he went away from there, ^1353

and coming to his hometown he taught them in their synagogue, so that they were astonished, and said, Where did this man get this wisdom and these mighty works? ^1354

Is not this the carpenter's son? Is not his mother called Mary? And are not his brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas? ^1355

And are not all his sisters with us? Where then did this man get all these things? ^1356

And they took offense at him. But Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honor except in his hometown and in his own household. ^1357

And he did not do many mighty works there, because of their unbelief. ^1358


At that time Herod the tetrarch heard about the fame of Jesus, ^1401

and he said to his servants, This is John the Baptist. He has been raised from the dead; that is why these miraculous powers are at work in him. ^1402

For Herod had seized John and bound him and put him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, ^1403

because John had been saying to him, It is not lawful for you to have her. ^1404

And though he wanted to put him to death, he feared the people, because they held him to be a prophet. ^1405

But when Herod's birthday came, the daughter of Herodias danced before the company and pleased Herod, ^1406

so that he promised with an oath to give her whatever she might ask. ^1407

Prompted by her mother, she said, Give me the head of John the Baptist here on a platter. ^1408

And the king was sorry, but because of his oaths and his guests he commanded it to be given. ^1409

He sent and had John beheaded in the prison, ^1410

and his head was brought on a platter and given to the girl, and she brought it to her mother. ^1411

And his disciples came and took the body and buried it, and they went and told Jesus. ^1412

Now when Jesus heard this, he withdrew from there in a boat to a desolate place by himself. But when the crowds heard it, they followed him on foot from the towns. ^1413

When he went ashore he saw a great crowd, and he had compassion on them and healed their sick. ^1414

Now when it was evening, the disciples came to him and said, This is a desolate place, and the day is now over; send the crowds away to go into the villages and buy food for themselves. ^1415

But Jesus said, They need not go away; you give them something to eat. ^1416

They said to him, We have only five loaves here and two fish. ^1417

And he said, Bring them here to me. ^1418

Then he ordered the crowds to sit down on the grass, and taking the five loaves and the two fish, he looked up to heaven and said a blessing. Then he broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds. ^1419

And they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up twelve baskets full of the broken pieces left over. ^1420

And those who ate were about five thousand men, besides women and children. ^1421

Immediately he made the disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, while he dismissed the crowds. ^1422

And after he had dismissed the crowds, he went up on the mountain by himself to pray. When evening came, he was there alone, ^1423

but the boat by this time was a long way from the land, beaten by the waves, for the wind was against them. ^1424

And in the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea. ^1425

But when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were terrified, and said, It is a ghost! and they cried out in fear. ^1426

But immediately Jesus spoke to them, saying, Take heart; it is I. Do not be afraid. ^1427

And Peter answered him, Lord, if it is you, command me to come to you on the water. ^1428

He said, Come. So Peter got out of the boat and walked on the water and came to Jesus. ^1429

But when he saw the wind, he was afraid, and beginning to sink he cried out, Lord, save me. ^1430

Jesus immediately reached out his hand and took hold of him, saying to him, O you of little faith, why did you doubt? ^1431

And when they got into the boat, the wind ceased. ^1432

And those in the boat worshiped him, saying, Truly you are the Son of God. ^1433

And when they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret. ^1434

And when the men of that place recognized him, they sent around to all that region and brought to him all who were sick ^1435

and implored him that they might only touch the fringe of his garment. And as many as touched it were made well. ^1436


Then Pharisees and scribes came to Jesus from Jerusalem and said, ^1501

Why do your disciples break the tradition of the elders? For they do not wash their hands when they eat. ^1502

He answered them, And why do you break the commandment of God for the sake of your tradition? ^1503

For God commanded, 'Honor your father and your mother,' and, 'Whoever reviles father or mother must surely die.' ^1504

But you say, 'If anyone tells his father or his mother, What you would have gained from me is given to God, ^1505

he need not honor his father.' So for the sake of your tradition you have made void the word of God. ^1506

You hypocrites! Well did Isaiah prophesy of you, when he said: ^1507

'This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me; ^1508

in vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.' ^1509

And he called the people to him and said to them, Hear and understand: ^1510

it is not what goes into the mouth that defiles a person, but what comes out of the mouth; this defiles a person. ^1511

Then the disciples came and said to him, Do you know that the Pharisees were offended when they heard this saying? ^1512

He answered, Every plant that my heavenly Father has not planted will be rooted up. ^1513

Let them alone; they are blind guides. And if the blind lead the blind, both will fall into a pit. ^1514

But Peter said to him, Explain the parable to us. ^1515

And he said, Are you also still without understanding? ^1516

Do you not see that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the stomach and is expelled? ^1517

But what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart, and this defiles a person. ^1518

For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false witness, slander. ^1519

These are what defile a person. But to eat with unwashed hands does not defile anyone. ^1520

And Jesus went away from there and withdrew to the district of Tyre and Sidon. ^1521

And behold, a Canaanite woman from that region came out and was crying, Have mercy on me, O Lord, Son of David; my daughter is severely oppressed by a demon. ^1522

But he did not answer her a word. And his disciples came and begged him, saying, Send her away, for she is crying out after us. ^1523

He answered, I was sent only to the lost sheep of the house of Israel. ^1524

But she came and knelt before him, saying, Lord, help me. ^1525

And he answered, It is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs. ^1526

She said, Yes, Lord, yet even the dogs eat the crumbs that fall from their masters' table. ^1527

Then Jesus answered her, O woman, great is your faith! Be it done for you as you desire. And her daughter was healed instantly. ^1528

Jesus went on from there and walked beside the Sea of Galilee. And he went up on the mountain and sat down there. ^1529

And great crowds came to him, bringing with them the lame, the blind, the crippled, the mute, and many others, and they put them at his feet, and he healed them, ^1530

so that the crowd wondered, when they saw the mute speaking, the crippled healthy, the lame walking, and the blind seeing. And they glorified the God of Israel. ^1531

Then Jesus called his disciples to him and said, I have compassion on the crowd because they have been with me now three days and have nothing to eat. And I am unwilling to send them away hungry, lest they faint on the way. ^1532

And the disciples said to him, Where are we to get enough bread in such a desolate place to feed so great a crowd? ^1533

And Jesus said to them, How many loaves do you have? They said, Seven, and a few small fish. ^1534

And directing the crowd to sit down on the ground, ^1535

he took the seven loaves and the fish, and having given thanks he broke them and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples gave them to the crowds. ^1536

And they all ate and were satisfied. And they took up seven baskets full of the broken pieces left over. ^1537

Those who ate were four thousand men, besides women and children. ^1538

And after sending away the crowds, he got into the boat and went to the region of Magadan. ^1539


And the Pharisees and Sadducees came, and to test him they asked him to show them a sign from heaven. ^1601

He answered them, When it is evening, you say, 'It will be fair weather, for the sky is red.' ^1602

And in the morning, 'It will be stormy today, for the sky is red and threatening.' You know how to interpret the appearance of the sky, but you cannot interpret the signs of the times. ^1603

An evil and adulterous generation seeks for a sign, but no sign will be given to it except the sign of Jonah. So he left them and departed. ^1604

When the disciples reached the other side, they had forgotten to bring any bread. ^1605

Jesus said to them, Watch and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees. ^1606

And they began discussing it among themselves, saying, We brought no bread. ^1607

But Jesus, aware of this, said, O you of little faith, why are you discussing among yourselves the fact that you have no bread? ^1608

Do you not yet perceive? Do you not remember the five loaves for the five thousand, and how many baskets you gathered? ^1609

Or the seven loaves for the four thousand, and how many baskets you gathered? ^1610

How is it that you fail to understand that I did not speak about bread? Beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees. ^1611

Then they understood that he did not tell them to beware of the leaven of bread, but of the teaching of the Pharisees and Sadducees. ^1612

Now when Jesus came into the district of Caesarea Philippi, he asked his disciples, Who do people say that the Son of Man is? ^1613

And they said, Some say John the Baptist, others say Elijah, and others Jeremiah or one of the prophets. ^1614

He said to them, But who do you say that I am? ^1615

Simon Peter replied, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God. ^1616

And Jesus answered him, Blessed are you, Simon Bar-Jonah! For flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven. ^1617

And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. ^1618

I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. ^1619

Then he strictly charged the disciples to tell no one that he was the Christ. ^1620

From that time Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and chief priests and scribes, and be killed, and on the third day be raised. ^1621

And Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him, saying, Far be it from you, Lord! This shall never happen to you. ^1622

But he turned and said to Peter, Get behind me, Satan! You are a hindrance to me. For you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man. ^1623

Then Jesus told his disciples, If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. ^1624

For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it. ^1625

For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his life? Or what shall a man give in return for his life? ^1626

For the Son of Man is going to come with his angels in the glory of his Father, and then he will repay each person according to what he has done. ^1627

Truly, I say to you, there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in his kingdom. ^1628


And after six days Jesus took with him Peter and James, and John his brother, and led them up a high mountain by themselves. ^1701

And he was transfigured before them, and his face shone like the sun, and his clothes became white as light. ^1702

And behold, there appeared to them Moses and Elijah, talking with him. ^1703

And Peter said to Jesus, Lord, it is good that we are here. If you wish, I will make three tents here, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah. ^1704

He was still speaking when, behold, a bright cloud overshadowed them, and a voice from the cloud said, This is my beloved Son, with whom I am well pleased; listen to him. ^1705

When the disciples heard this, they fell on their faces and were terrified. ^1706

But Jesus came and touched them, saying, Rise, and have no fear. ^1707

And when they lifted up their eyes, they saw no one but Jesus only. ^1708

And as they were coming down the mountain, Jesus commanded them, Tell no one the vision, until the Son of Man is raised from the dead. ^1709

And the disciples asked him, Then why do the scribes say that first Elijah must come? ^1710

He answered, Elijah does come, and he will restore all things. ^1711

But I tell you that Elijah has already come, and they did not recognize him, but did to him whatever they pleased. So also the Son of Man will certainly suffer at their hands. ^1712

Then the disciples understood that he was speaking to them of John the Baptist. ^1713

And when they came to the crowd, a man came up to him and, kneeling before him, ^1714

said, Lord, have mercy on my son, for he is an epileptic and he suffers terribly. For often he falls into the fire, and often into the water. ^1715

And I brought him to your disciples, and they could not heal him. ^1716

And Jesus answered, O faithless and twisted generation, how long am I to be with you? How long am I to bear with you? Bring him here to me. ^1717

And Jesus rebuked him, and the demon came out of him, and the boy was healed instantly. ^1718

Then the disciples came to Jesus privately and said, Why could we not cast it out? ^1719

He said to them, Because of your little faith. For truly, I say to you, if you have faith like a grain of mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, 'Move from here to there,' and it will move, and nothing will be impossible for you. ^1720

See Footnote ^1721

As they were gathering in Galilee, Jesus said to them, The Son of Man is about to be delivered into the hands of men, ^1722

and they will kill him, and he will be raised on the third day. And they were greatly distressed. ^1723

When they came to Capernaum, the collectors of the half-shekel tax went up to Peter and said, Does your teacher not pay the tax? ^1724

He said, Yes. And when he came into the house, Jesus spoke to him first, saying, What do you think, Simon? From whom do kings of the earth take toll or tax? From their sons or from others? ^1725

And when he said, From others, Jesus said to him, Then the sons are free. ^1726

However, not to give offense to them, go to the sea and cast a hook and take the first fish that comes up, and when you open its mouth you will find a shekel. Take that and give it to them for me and for yourself. ^1727


At that time the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven? ^1801

And calling to him a child, he put him in the midst of them ^1802

and said, Truly, I say to you, unless you turn and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. ^1803

Whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. ^1804

Whoever receives one such child in my name receives me, ^1805

but whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him to have a great millstone fastened around his neck and to be drowned in the depth of the sea. ^1806

Woe to the world for temptations to sin! For it is necessary that temptations come, but woe to the one by whom the temptation comes! ^1807

And if your hand or your foot causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life crippled or lame than with two hands or two feet to be thrown into the eternal fire. ^1808

And if your eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away. It is better for you to enter life with one eye than with two eyes to be thrown into the hell of fire. ^1809

See that you do not despise one of these little ones. For I tell you that in heaven their angels always see the face of my Father who is in heaven. ^1810

See Footnote ^1811

What do you think? If a man has a hundred sheep and one of them has gone astray, does he not leave the ninety-nine on the mountains and go in search of the one that went astray? ^1812

And if he finds it, truly, I say to you, he rejoices over it more than over the ninety-nine that never went astray. ^1813

So it is not the will of my Father who is in heaven that one of these little ones should perish. ^1814

If your brother sins against you, go and tell him his fault, between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother. ^1815

But if he does not listen, take one or two others along with you, that every charge may be established by the evidence of two or three witnesses. ^1816

If he refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church. And if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile and a tax collector. ^1817

Truly, I say to you, whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven. ^1818

Again I say to you, if two of you agree on earth about anything they ask, it will be done for them by my Father in heaven. ^1819

For where two or three are gathered in my name, there am I among them. ^1820

Then Peter came up and said to him, Lord, how often will my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? As many as seven times? ^1821

Jesus said to him, I do not say to you seven times, but seventy times seven. ^1822

Therefore the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who wished to settle accounts with his servants. ^1823

When he began to settle, one was brought to him who owed him ten thousand talents. ^1824

And since he could not pay, his master ordered him to be sold, with his wife and children and all that he had, and payment to be made. ^1825

So the servant fell on his knees, imploring him, 'Have patience with me, and I will pay you everything.' ^1826

And out of pity for him, the master of that servant released him and forgave him the debt. ^1827

But when that same servant went out, he found one of his fellow servants who owed him a hundred denarii, and seizing him, he began to choke him, saying, 'Pay what you owe.' ^1828

So his fellow servant fell down and pleaded with him, 'Have patience with me, and I will pay you.' ^1829

He refused and went and put him in prison until he should pay the debt. ^1830

When his fellow servants saw what had taken place, they were greatly distressed, and they went and reported to their master all that had taken place. ^1831

Then his master summoned him and said to him, 'You wicked servant! I forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me. ^1832

And should not you have had mercy on your fellow servant, as I had mercy on you?' ^1833

And in anger his master delivered him to the jailers, until he should pay all his debt. ^1834

So also my heavenly Father will do to every one of you, if you do not forgive your brother from your heart. ^1835


Now when Jesus had finished these sayings, he went away from Galilee and entered the region of Judea beyond the Jordan. ^1901

And large crowds followed him, and he healed them there. ^1902

And Pharisees came up to him and tested him by asking, Is it lawful to divorce one's wife for any cause? ^1903

He answered, Have you not read that he who created them from the beginning made them male and female, ^1904

and said, 'Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother and hold fast to his wife, and they shall become one flesh'? ^1905

So they are no longer two but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate. ^1906

They said to him, Why then did Moses command one to give a certificate of divorce and to send her away? ^1907

He said to them, Because of your hardness of heart Moses allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it was not so. ^1908

And I say to you: whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another, commits adultery. ^1909

The disciples said to him, If such is the case of a man with his wife, it is better not to marry. ^1910

But he said to them, Not everyone can receive this saying, but only those to whom it is given. ^1911

For there are eunuchs who have been so from birth, and there are eunuchs who have been made eunuchs by men, and there are eunuchs who have made themselves eunuchs for the sake of the kingdom of heaven. Let the one who is able to receive this receive it. ^1912

Then children were brought to him that he might lay his hands on them and pray. The disciples rebuked the people, ^1913

but Jesus said, Let the little children come to me and do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of heaven. ^1914

And he laid his hands on them and went away. ^1915

And behold, a man came up to him, saying, Teacher, what good deed must I do to have eternal life? ^1916

And he said to him, Why do you ask me about what is good? There is only one who is good. If you would enter life, keep the commandments. ^1917

He said to him, Which ones? And Jesus said, You shall not murder, You shall not commit adultery, You shall not steal, You shall not bear false witness, ^1918

Honor your father and mother, and, You shall love your neighbor as yourself. ^1919

The young man said to him, All these I have kept. What do I still lack? ^1920

Jesus said to him, If you would be perfect, go, sell what you possess and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me. ^1921

When the young man heard this he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions. ^1922

And Jesus said to his disciples, Truly, I say to you, only with difficulty will a rich person enter the kingdom of heaven. ^1923

Again I tell you, it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God. ^1924

When the disciples heard this, they were greatly astonished, saying, Who then can be saved? ^1925

But Jesus looked at them and said, With man this is impossible, but with God all things are possible. ^1926

Then Peter said in reply, See, we have left everything and followed you. What then will we have? ^1927

Jesus said to them, Truly, I say to you, in the new world, when the Son of Man will sit on his glorious throne, you who have followed me will also sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel. ^1928

And everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or lands, for my name's sake, will receive a hundredfold and will inherit eternal life. ^1929

But many who are first will be last, and the last first. ^1930


For the kingdom of heaven is like a master of a house who went out early in the morning to hire laborers for his vineyard. ^2001

After agreeing with the laborers for a denarius a day, he sent them into his vineyard. ^2002

And going out about the third hour he saw others standing idle in the marketplace, ^2003

and to them he said, 'You go into the vineyard too, and whatever is right I will give you.' ^2004

So they went. Going out again about the sixth hour and the ninth hour, he did the same. ^2005

And about the eleventh hour he went out and found others standing. And he said to them, 'Why do you stand here idle all day?' ^2006

They said to him, 'Because no one has hired us.' He said to them, 'You go into the vineyard too.' ^2007

And when evening came, the owner of the vineyard said to his foreman, 'Call the laborers and pay them their wages, beginning with the last, up to the first.' ^2008

And when those hired about the eleventh hour came, each of them received a denarius. ^2009

Now when those hired first came, they thought they would receive more, but each of them also received a denarius. ^2010

And on receiving it they grumbled at the master of the house, ^2011

saying, 'These last worked only one hour, and you have made them equal to us who have borne the burden of the day and the scorching heat.' ^2012

But he replied to one of them, 'Friend, I am doing you no wrong. Did you not agree with me for a denarius? ^2013

Take what belongs to you and go. I choose to give to this last worker as I give to you. ^2014

Am I not allowed to do what I choose with what belongs to me? Or do you begrudge my generosity?' ^2015

So the last will be first, and the first last. ^2016

And as Jesus was going up to Jerusalem, he took the twelve disciples aside, and on the way he said to them, ^2017

See, we are going up to Jerusalem. And the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and scribes, and they will condemn him to death ^2018

and deliver him over to the Gentiles to be mocked and flogged and crucified, and he will be raised on the third day. ^2019

Then the mother of the sons of Zebedee came up to him with her sons, and kneeling before him she asked him for something. ^2020

And he said to her, What do you want? She said to him, Say that these two sons of mine are to sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your kingdom. ^2021

Jesus answered, You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I am to drink? They said to him, We are able. ^2022

He said to them, You will drink my cup, but to sit at my right hand and at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared by my Father. ^2023

And when the ten heard it, they were indignant at the two brothers. ^2024

But Jesus called them to him and said, You know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them. ^2025

It shall not be so among you. But whoever would be great among you must be your servant, ^2026

and whoever would be first among you must be your slave, ^2027

even as the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many. ^2028

And as they went out of Jericho, a great crowd followed him. ^2029

And behold, there were two blind men sitting by the roadside, and when they heard that Jesus was passing by, they cried out, Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David! ^2030

The crowd rebuked them, telling them to be silent, but they cried out all the more, Lord, have mercy on us, Son of David! ^2031

And stopping, Jesus called them and said, What do you want me to do for you? ^2032

They said to him, Lord, let our eyes be opened. ^2033

And Jesus in pity touched their eyes, and immediately they recovered their sight and followed him. ^2034


Now when they drew near to Jerusalem and came to Bethphage, to the Mount of Olives, then Jesus sent two disciples, ^2101

saying to them, Go into the village in front of you, and immediately you will find a donkey tied, and a colt with her. Untie them and bring them to me. ^2102

If anyone says anything to you, you shall say, 'The Lord needs them,' and he will send them at once. ^2103

This took place to fulfill what was spoken by the prophet, saying, ^2104

Say to the daughter of Zion, 'Behold, your king is coming to you, humble, and mounted on a donkey, and on a colt, the foal of a beast of burden.' ^2105

The disciples went and did as Jesus had directed them. ^2106

They brought the donkey and the colt and put on them their cloaks, and he sat on them. ^2107

Most of the crowd spread their cloaks on the road, and others cut branches from the trees and spread them on the road. ^2108

And the crowds that went before him and that followed him were shouting, Hosanna to the Son of David! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! Hosanna in the highest! ^2109

And when he entered Jerusalem, the whole city was stirred up, saying, Who is this? ^2110

And the crowds said, This is the prophet Jesus, from Nazareth of Galilee. ^2111

And Jesus entered the temple and drove out all who sold and bought in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who sold pigeons. ^2112

He said to them, It is written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer,' but you make it a den of robbers. ^2113

And the blind and the lame came to him in the temple, and he healed them. ^2114

But when the chief priests and the scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying out in the temple, Hosanna to the Son of David! they were indignant, ^2115

and they said to him, Do you hear what these are saying? And Jesus said to them, Yes; have you never read, 'Out of the mouth of infants and nursing babies you have prepared praise'? ^2116

And leaving them, he went out of the city to Bethany and lodged there. ^2117

In the morning, as he was returning to the city, he became hungry. ^2118

And seeing a fig tree by the wayside, he went to it and found nothing on it but only leaves. And he said to it, May no fruit ever come from you again! And the fig tree withered at once. ^2119

When the disciples saw it, they marveled, saying, How did the fig tree wither at once? ^2120

And Jesus answered them, Truly, I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you will not only do what has been done to the fig tree, but even if you say to this mountain, 'Be taken up and thrown into the sea,' it will happen. ^2121

And whatever you ask in prayer, you will receive, if you have faith. ^2122

And when he entered the temple, the chief priests and the elders of the people came up to him as he was teaching, and said, By what authority are you doing these things, and who gave you this authority? ^2123

Jesus answered them, I also will ask you one question, and if you tell me the answer, then I also will tell you by what authority I do these things. ^2124

The baptism of John, from where did it come? From heaven or from man? And they discussed it among themselves, saying, If we say, 'From heaven,' he will say to us, 'Why then did you not believe him?' ^2125

But if we say, 'From man,' we are afraid of the crowd, for they all hold that John was a prophet. ^2126

So they answered Jesus, We do not know. And he said to them, Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things. ^2127

What do you think? A man had two sons. And he went to the first and said, 'Son, go and work in the vineyard today.' ^2128

And he answered, 'I will not,' but afterward he changed his mind and went. ^2129

And he went to the other son and said the same. And he answered, 'I go, sir,' but did not go. ^2130

Which of the two did the will of his father? They said, The first. Jesus said to them, Truly, I say to you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes go into the kingdom of God before you. ^2131

For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the prostitutes believed him. And even when you saw it, you did not afterward change your minds and believe him. ^2132

Hear another parable. There was a master of a house who planted a vineyard and put a fence around it and dug a winepress in it and built a tower and leased it to tenants, and went into another country. ^2133

When the season for fruit drew near, he sent his servants to the tenants to get his fruit. ^2134

And the tenants took his servants and beat one, killed another, and stoned another. ^2135

Again he sent other servants, more than the first. And they did the same to them. ^2136

Finally he sent his son to them, saying, 'They will respect my son.' ^2137

But when the tenants saw the son, they said to themselves, 'This is the heir. Come, let us kill him and have his inheritance.' ^2138

And they took him and threw him out of the vineyard and killed him. ^2139

When therefore the owner of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those tenants? ^2140

They said to him, He will put those wretches to a miserable death and let out the vineyard to other tenants who will give him the fruits in their seasons. ^2141

Jesus said to them, Have you never read in the Scriptures: 'The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; this was the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes'? ^2142

Therefore I tell you, the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people producing its fruits. ^2143

And the one who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces; and when it falls on anyone, it will crush him. ^2144

When the chief priests and the Pharisees heard his parables, they perceived that he was speaking about them. ^2145

And although they were seeking to arrest him, they feared the crowds, because they held him to be a prophet. ^2146


And again Jesus spoke to them in parables, saying, ^2201

The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who gave a wedding feast for his son, ^2202

and sent his servants to call those who were invited to the wedding feast, but they would not come. ^2203

Again he sent other servants, saying, 'Tell those who are invited, See, I have prepared my dinner, my oxen and my fat calves have been slaughtered, and everything is ready. Come to the wedding feast.' ^2204

But they paid no attention and went off, one to his farm, another to his business, ^2205

while the rest seized his servants, treated them shamefully, and killed them. ^2206

The king was angry, and he sent his troops and destroyed those murderers and burned their city. ^2207

Then he said to his servants, 'The wedding feast is ready, but those invited were not worthy. ^2208

Go therefore to the main roads and invite to the wedding feast as many as you find.' ^2209

And those servants went out into the roads and gathered all whom they found, both bad and good. So the wedding hall was filled with guests. ^2210

But when the king came in to look at the guests, he saw there a man who had no wedding garment. ^2211

And he said to him, 'Friend, how did you get in here without a wedding garment?' And he was speechless. ^2212

Then the king said to the attendants, 'Bind him hand and foot and cast him into the outer darkness. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.' ^2213

For many are called, but few are chosen. ^2214

Then the Pharisees went and plotted how to entangle him in his talk. ^2215

And they sent their disciples to him, along with the Herodians, saying, Teacher, we know that you are true and teach the way of God truthfully, and you do not care about anyone's opinion, for you are not swayed by appearances. ^2216

Tell us, then, what you think. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not? ^2217

But Jesus, aware of their malice, said, Why put me to the test, you hypocrites? ^2218

Show me the coin for the tax. And they brought him a denarius. ^2219

And Jesus said to them, Whose likeness and inscription is this? ^2220

They said, Caesar's. Then he said to them, Therefore render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's. ^2221

When they heard it, they marveled. And they left him and went away. ^2222

The same day Sadducees came to him, who say that there is no resurrection, and they asked him a question, ^2223

saying, Teacher, Moses said, 'If a man dies having no children, his brother must marry the widow and raise up children for his brother.' ^2224

Now there were seven brothers among us. The first married and died, and having no children left his wife to his brother. ^2225

So too the second and third, down to the seventh. ^2226

After them all, the woman died. ^2227

In the resurrection, therefore, of the seven, whose wife will she be? For they all had her. ^2228

But Jesus answered them, You are wrong, because you know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God. ^2229

For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven. ^2230

And as for the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was said to you by God: ^2231

'I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'? He is not God of the dead, but of the living. ^2232

And when the crowd heard it, they were astonished at his teaching. ^2233

But when the Pharisees heard that he had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered together. ^2234

And one of them, a lawyer, asked him a question to test him. ^2235

Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law? ^2236

And he said to him, You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind. ^2237

This is the great and first commandment. ^2238

And a second is like it: You shall love your neighbor as yourself. ^2239

On these two commandments depend all the Law and the Prophets. ^2240

Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question, ^2241

saying, What do you think about the Christ? Whose son is he? They said to him, The son of David. ^2242

He said to them, How is it then that David, in the Spirit, calls him Lord, saying, ^2243

'The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand, until I put your enemies under your feet'? ^2244

If then David calls him Lord, how is he his son? ^2245

And no one was able to answer him a word, nor from that day did anyone dare to ask him any more questions. ^2246


Then Jesus said to the crowds and to his disciples, ^2301

The scribes and the Pharisees sit on Moses' seat, ^2302

so practice and observe whatever they tell you--but not what they do. For they preach, but do not practice. ^2303

They tie up heavy burdens, hard to bear, and lay them on people's shoulders, but they themselves are not willing to move them with their finger. ^2304

They do all their deeds to be seen by others. For they make their phylacteries broad and their fringes long, ^2305

and they love the place of honor at feasts and the best seats in the synagogues ^2306

and greetings in the marketplaces and being called rabbi by others. ^2307

But you are not to be called rabbi, for you have one teacher, and you are all brothers. ^2308

And call no man your father on earth, for you have one Father, who is in heaven. ^2309

Neither be called instructors, for you have one instructor, the Christ. ^2310

The greatest among you shall be your servant. ^2311

Whoever exalts himself will be humbled, and whoever humbles himself will be exalted. ^2312

But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you shut the kingdom of heaven in people's faces. For you neither enter yourselves nor allow those who would enter to go in. ^2313

See Footnote ^2314

Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you travel across sea and land to make a single proselyte, and when he becomes a proselyte, you make him twice as much a child of hell as yourselves. ^2315

Woe to you, blind guides, who say, 'If anyone swears by the temple, it is nothing, but if anyone swears by the gold of the temple, he is bound by his oath.' ^2316

You blind fools! For which is greater, the gold or the temple that has made the gold sacred? ^2317

And you say, 'If anyone swears by the altar, it is nothing, but if anyone swears by the gift that is on the altar, he is bound by his oath.' ^2318

You blind men! For which is greater, the gift or the altar that makes the gift sacred? ^2319

So whoever swears by the altar swears by it and by everything on it. ^2320

And whoever swears by the temple swears by it and by him who dwells in it. ^2321

And whoever swears by heaven swears by the throne of God and by him who sits upon it. ^2322

Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you tithe mint and dill and cumin, and have neglected the weightier matters of the law: justice and mercy and faithfulness. These you ought to have done, without neglecting the others. ^2323

You blind guides, straining out a gnat and swallowing a camel! ^2324

Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and the plate, but inside they are full of greed and self-indulgence. ^2325

You blind Pharisee! First clean the inside of the cup and the plate, that the outside also may be clean. ^2326

Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs, which outwardly appear beautiful, but within are full of dead people's bones and all uncleanness. ^2327

So you also outwardly appear righteous to others, but within you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness. ^2328

Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you build the tombs of the prophets and decorate the monuments of the righteous, ^2329

saying, 'If we had lived in the days of our fathers, we would not have taken part with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.' ^2330

Thus you witness against yourselves that you are sons of those who murdered the prophets. ^2331

Fill up, then, the measure of your fathers. ^2332

You serpents, you brood of vipers, how are you to escape being sentenced to hell? ^2333

Therefore I send you prophets and wise men and scribes, some of whom you will kill and crucify, and some you will flog in your synagogues and persecute from town to town, ^2334

so that on you may come all the righteous blood shed on earth, from the blood of innocent Abel to the blood of Zechariah the son of Barachiah, whom you murdered between the sanctuary and the altar. ^2335

Truly, I say to you, all these things will come upon this generation. ^2336

O Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city that kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to it! How often would I have gathered your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you would not! ^2337

See, your house is left to you desolate. ^2338

For I tell you, you will not see me again, until you say, 'Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord.' ^2339


Jesus left the temple and was going away, when his disciples came to point out to him the buildings of the temple. ^2401

But he answered them, You see all these, do you not? Truly, I say to you, there will not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down. ^2402

As he sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to him privately, saying, Tell us, when will these things be, and what will be the sign of your coming and of the close of the age? ^2403

And Jesus answered them, See that no one leads you astray. ^2404

For many will come in my name, saying, 'I am the Christ,' and they will lead many astray. ^2405

And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not alarmed, for this must take place, but the end is not yet. ^2406

For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom, and there will be famines and earthquakes in various places. ^2407

All these are but the beginning of the birth pains. ^2408

Then they will deliver you up to tribulation and put you to death, and you will be hated by all nations for my name's sake. ^2409

And then many will fall away and betray one another and hate one another. ^2410

And many false prophets will arise and lead many astray. ^2411

And because lawlessness will be increased, the love of many will grow cold. ^2412

But the one who endures to the end will be saved. ^2413

And this gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed throughout the whole world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come. ^2414

So when you see the abomination of desolation spoken of by the prophet Daniel, standing in the holy place (let the reader understand), ^2415

then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. ^2416

Let the one who is on the housetop not go down to take what is in his house, ^2417

and let the one who is in the field not turn back to take his cloak. ^2418

And alas for women who are pregnant and for those who are nursing infants in those days! ^2419

Pray that your flight may not be in winter or on a Sabbath. ^2420

For then there will be great tribulation, such as has not been from the beginning of the world until now, no, and never will be. ^2421

And if those days had not been cut short, no human being would be saved. But for the sake of the elect those days will be cut short. ^2422

Then if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or 'There he is!' do not believe it. ^2423

For false christs and false prophets will arise and perform great signs and wonders, so as to lead astray, if possible, even the elect. ^2424

See, I have told you beforehand. ^2425

So, if they say to you, 'Look, he is in the wilderness,' do not go out. If they say, 'Look, he is in the inner rooms,' do not believe it. ^2426

For as the lightning comes from the east and shines as far as the west, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. ^2427

Wherever the corpse is, there the vultures will gather. ^2428

Immediately after the tribulation of those days the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, and the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken. ^2429

Then will appear in heaven the sign of the Son of Man, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. ^2430

And he will send out his angels with a loud trumpet call, and they will gather his elect from the four winds, from one end of heaven to the other. ^2431

From the fig tree learn its lesson: as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts out its leaves, you know that summer is near. ^2432

So also, when you see all these things, you know that he is near, at the very gates. ^2433

Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place. ^2434

Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away. ^2435

But concerning that day and hour no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father only. ^2436

As were the days of Noah, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. ^2437

For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day when Noah entered the ark, ^2438

and they were unaware until the flood came and swept them all away, so will be the coming of the Son of Man. ^2439

Then two men will be in the field; one will be taken and one left. ^2440

Two women will be grinding at the mill; one will be taken and one left. ^2441

Therefore, stay awake, for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming. ^2442

But know this, that if the master of the house had known in what part of the night the thief was coming, he would have stayed awake and would not have let his house be broken into. ^2443

Therefore you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at an hour you do not expect. ^2444

Who then is the faithful and wise servant, whom his master has set over his household, to give them their food at the proper time? ^2445

Blessed is that servant whom his master will find so doing when he comes. ^2446

Truly, I say to you, he will set him over all his possessions. ^2447

But if that wicked servant says to himself, 'My master is delayed,' ^2448

and begins to beat his fellow servants and eats and drinks with drunkards, ^2449

the master of that servant will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour he does not know ^2450

and will cut him in pieces and put him with the hypocrites. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. ^2451


Then the kingdom of heaven will be like ten virgins who took their lamps and went to meet the bridegroom. ^2501

Five of them were foolish, and five were wise. ^2502

For when the foolish took their lamps, they took no oil with them, ^2503

but the wise took flasks of oil with their lamps. ^2504

As the bridegroom was delayed, they all became drowsy and slept. ^2505

But at midnight there was a cry, 'Here is the bridegroom! Come out to meet him.' ^2506

Then all those virgins rose and trimmed their lamps. ^2507

And the foolish said to the wise, 'Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out.' ^2508

But the wise answered, saying, 'Since there will not be enough for us and for you, go rather to the dealers and buy for yourselves.' ^2509

And while they were going to buy, the bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast, and the door was shut. ^2510

Afterward the other virgins came also, saying, 'Lord, lord, open to us.' ^2511

But he answered, 'Truly, I say to you, I do not know you.' ^2512

Watch therefore, for you know neither the day nor the hour. ^2513

For it will be like a man going on a journey, who called his servants and entrusted to them his property. ^2514

To one he gave five talents, to another two, to another one, to each according to his ability. Then he went away. ^2515

He who had received the five talents went at once and traded with them, and he made five talents more. ^2516

So also he who had the two talents made two talents more. ^2517

But he who had received the one talent went and dug in the ground and hid his master's money. ^2518

Now after a long time the master of those servants came and settled accounts with them. ^2519

And he who had received the five talents came forward, bringing five talents more, saying, 'Master, you delivered to me five talents; here I have made five talents more.' ^2520

His master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master.' ^2521

And he also who had the two talents came forward, saying, 'Master, you delivered to me two talents; here I have made two talents more.' ^2522

His master said to him, 'Well done, good and faithful servant. You have been faithful over a little; I will set you over much. Enter into the joy of your master.' ^2523

He also who had received the one talent came forward, saying, 'Master, I knew you to be a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you scattered no seed, ^2524

so I was afraid, and I went and hid your talent in the ground. Here you have what is yours.' ^2525

But his master answered him, 'You wicked and slothful servant! You knew that I reap where I have not sowed and gather where I scattered no seed? ^2526

Then you ought to have invested my money with the bankers, and at my coming I should have received what was my own with interest. ^2527

So take the talent from him and give it to him who has the ten talents. ^2528

For to everyone who has will more be given, and he will have an abundance. But from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away. ^2529

And cast the worthless servant into the outer darkness. In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.' ^2530

When the Son of Man comes in his glory, and all the angels with him, then he will sit on his glorious throne. ^2531

Before him will be gathered all the nations, and he will separate people one from another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. ^2532

And he will place the sheep on his right, but the goats on the left. ^2533

Then the King will say to those on his right, 'Come, you who are blessed by my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. ^2534

For I was hungry and you gave me food, I was thirsty and you gave me drink, I was a stranger and you welcomed me, ^2535

I was naked and you clothed me, I was sick and you visited me, I was in prison and you came to me.' ^2536

Then the righteous will answer him, saying, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry and feed you, or thirsty and give you drink? ^2537

And when did we see you a stranger and welcome you, or naked and clothe you? ^2538

And when did we see you sick or in prison and visit you?' ^2539

And the King will answer them, 'Truly, I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these my brothers, you did it to me.' ^2540

Then he will say to those on his left, 'Depart from me, you cursed, into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. ^2541

For I was hungry and you gave me no food, I was thirsty and you gave me no drink, ^2542

I was a stranger and you did not welcome me, naked and you did not clothe me, sick and in prison and you did not visit me.' ^2543

Then they also will answer, saying, 'Lord, when did we see you hungry or thirsty or a stranger or naked or sick or in prison, and did not minister to you?' ^2544

Then he will answer them, saying, 'Truly, I say to you, as you did not do it to one of the least of these, you did not do it to me.' ^2545

And these will go away into eternal punishment, but the righteous into eternal life. ^2546


When Jesus had finished all these sayings, he said to his disciples, ^2601

You know that after two days the Passover is coming, and the Son of Man will be delivered up to be crucified. ^2602

Then the chief priests and the elders of the people gathered in the palace of the high priest, whose name was Caiaphas, ^2603

and plotted together in order to arrest Jesus by stealth and kill him. ^2604

But they said, Not during the feast, lest there be an uproar among the people. ^2605

Now when Jesus was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, ^2606

a woman came up to him with an alabaster flask of very expensive ointment, and she poured it on his head as he reclined at table. ^2607

And when the disciples saw it, they were indignant, saying, Why this waste? ^2608

For this could have been sold for a large sum and given to the poor. ^2609

But Jesus, aware of this, said to them, Why do you trouble the woman? For she has done a beautiful thing to me. ^2610

For you always have the poor with you, but you will not always have me. ^2611

In pouring this ointment on my body, she has done it to prepare me for burial. ^2612

Truly, I say to you, wherever this gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will also be told in memory of her. ^2613

Then one of the twelve, whose name was Judas Iscariot, went to the chief priests ^2614

and said, What will you give me if I deliver him over to you? And they paid him thirty pieces of silver. ^2615

And from that moment he sought an opportunity to betray him. ^2616

Now on the first day of Unleavened Bread the disciples came to Jesus, saying, Where will you have us prepare for you to eat the Passover? ^2617

He said, Go into the city to a certain man and say to him, 'The Teacher says, My time is at hand. I will keep the Passover at your house with my disciples.' ^2618

And the disciples did as Jesus had directed them, and they prepared the Passover. ^2619

When it was evening, he reclined at table with the twelve. ^2620

And as they were eating, he said, Truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me. ^2621

And they were very sorrowful and began to say to him one after another, Is it I, Lord? ^2622

He answered, He who has dipped his hand in the dish with me will betray me. ^2623

The Son of Man goes as it is written of him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born. ^2624

Judas, who would betray him, answered, Is it I, Rabbi? He said to him, You have said so. ^2625

Now as they were eating, Jesus took bread, and after blessing it broke it and gave it to the disciples, and said, Take, eat; this is my body. ^2626

And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, saying, Drink of it, all of you, ^2627

for this is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins. ^2628

I tell you I will not drink again of this fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new with you in my Father's kingdom. ^2629

And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. ^2630

Then Jesus said to them, You will all fall away because of me this night. For it is written, 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep of the flock will be scattered.' ^2631

But after I am raised up, I will go before you to Galilee. ^2632

Peter answered him, Though they all fall away because of you, I will never fall away. ^2633

Jesus said to him, Truly, I tell you, this very night, before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times. ^2634

Peter said to him, Even if I must die with you, I will not deny you! And all the disciples said the same. ^2635

Then Jesus went with them to a place called Gethsemane, and he said to his disciples, Sit here, while I go over there and pray. ^2636

And taking with him Peter and the two sons of Zebedee, he began to be sorrowful and troubled. ^2637

Then he said to them, My soul is very sorrowful, even to death; remain here, and watch with me. ^2638

And going a little farther he fell on his face and prayed, saying, My Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me; nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will. ^2639

And he came to the disciples and found them sleeping. And he said to Peter, So, could you not watch with me one hour? ^2640

Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. ^2641

Again, for the second time, he went away and prayed, My Father, if this cannot pass unless I drink it, your will be done. ^2642

And again he came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy. ^2643

So, leaving them again, he went away and prayed for the third time, saying the same words again. ^2644

Then he came to the disciples and said to them, Sleep and take your rest later on. See, the hour is at hand, and the Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. ^2645

Rise, let us be going; see, my betrayer is at hand. ^2646

While he was still speaking, Judas came, one of the twelve, and with him a great crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the elders of the people. ^2647

Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, The one I will kiss is the man; seize him. ^2648

And he came up to Jesus at once and said, Greetings, Rabbi! And he kissed him. ^2649

Jesus said to him, Friend, do what you came to do. Then they came up and laid hands on Jesus and seized him. ^2650

And behold, one of those who were with Jesus stretched out his hand and drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his ear. ^2651

Then Jesus said to him, Put your sword back into its place. For all who take the sword will perish by the sword. ^2652

Do you think that I cannot appeal to my Father, and he will at once send me more than twelve legions of angels? ^2653

But how then should the Scriptures be fulfilled, that it must be so? ^2654

At that hour Jesus said to the crowds, Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs to capture me? Day after day I sat in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me. ^2655

But all this has taken place that the Scriptures of the prophets might be fulfilled. Then all the disciples left him and fled. ^2656

Then those who had seized Jesus led him to Caiaphas the high priest, where the scribes and the elders had gathered. ^2657

And Peter was following him at a distance, as far as the courtyard of the high priest, and going inside he sat with the guards to see the end. ^2658

Now the chief priests and the whole Council were seeking false testimony against Jesus that they might put him to death, ^2659

but they found none, though many false witnesses came forward. At last two came forward ^2660

and said, This man said, 'I am able to destroy the temple of God, and to rebuild it in three days.' ^2661

And the high priest stood up and said, Have you no answer to make? What is it that these men testify against you? ^2662

But Jesus remained silent. And the high priest said to him, I adjure you by the living God, tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God. ^2663

Jesus said to him, You have said so. But I tell you, from now on you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven. ^2664

Then the high priest tore his robes and said, He has uttered blasphemy. What further witnesses do we need? You have now heard his blasphemy. ^2665

What is your judgment? They answered, He deserves death. ^2666

Then they spit in his face and struck him. And some slapped him, ^2667

saying, Prophesy to us, you Christ! Who is it that struck you? ^2668

Now Peter was sitting outside in the courtyard. And a servant girl came up to him and said, You also were with Jesus the Galilean. ^2669

But he denied it before them all, saying, I do not know what you mean. ^2670

And when he went out to the entrance, another servant girl saw him, and she said to the bystanders, This man was with Jesus of Nazareth. ^2671

And again he denied it with an oath: I do not know the man. ^2672

After a little while the bystanders came up and said to Peter, Certainly you too are one of them, for your accent betrays you. ^2673

Then he began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear, I do not know the man. And immediately the rooster crowed. ^2674

And Peter remembered the saying of Jesus, Before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times. And he went out and wept bitterly. ^2675


When morning came, all the chief priests and the elders of the people took counsel against Jesus to put him to death. ^2701

And they bound him and led him away and delivered him over to Pilate the governor. ^2702

Then when Judas, his betrayer, saw that Jesus was condemned, he changed his mind and brought back the thirty pieces of silver to the chief priests and the elders, ^2703

saying, I have sinned by betraying innocent blood. They said, What is that to us? See to it yourself. ^2704

And throwing down the pieces of silver into the temple, he departed, and he went and hanged himself. ^2705

But the chief priests, taking the pieces of silver, said, It is not lawful to put them into the treasury, since it is blood money. ^2706

So they took counsel and bought with them the potter's field as a burial place for strangers. ^2707

Therefore that field has been called the Field of Blood to this day. ^2708

Then was fulfilled what had been spoken by the prophet Jeremiah, saying, And they took the thirty pieces of silver, the price of him on whom a price had been set by some of the sons of Israel, ^2709

and they gave them for the potter's field, as the Lord directed me. ^2710

Now Jesus stood before the governor, and the governor asked him, Are you the King of the Jews? Jesus said, You have said so. ^2711

But when he was accused by the chief priests and elders, he gave no answer. ^2712

Then Pilate said to him, Do you not hear how many things they testify against you? ^2713

But he gave him no answer, not even to a single charge, so that the governor was greatly amazed. ^2714

Now at the feast the governor was accustomed to release for the crowd any one prisoner whom they wanted. ^2715

And they had then a notorious prisoner called Barabbas. ^2716

So when they had gathered, Pilate said to them, Whom do you want me to release for you: Barabbas, or Jesus who is called Christ? ^2717

For he knew that it was out of envy that they had delivered him up. ^2718

Besides, while he was sitting on the judgment seat, his wife sent word to him, Have nothing to do with that righteous man, for I have suffered much because of him today in a dream. ^2719

Now the chief priests and the elders persuaded the crowd to ask for Barabbas and destroy Jesus. ^2720

The governor again said to them, Which of the two do you want me to release for you? And they said, Barabbas. ^2721

Pilate said to them, Then what shall I do with Jesus who is called Christ? They all said, Let him be crucified! ^2722

And he said, Why, what evil has he done? But they shouted all the more, Let him be crucified! ^2723

So when Pilate saw that he was gaining nothing, but rather that a riot was beginning, he took water and washed his hands before the crowd, saying, I am innocent of this man's blood; see to it yourselves. ^2724

And all the people answered, His blood be on us and on our children! ^2725

Then he released for them Barabbas, and having scourged Jesus, delivered him to be crucified. ^2726

Then the soldiers of the governor took Jesus into the governor's headquarters, and they gathered the whole battalion before him. ^2727

And they stripped him and put a scarlet robe on him, ^2728

and twisting together a crown of thorns, they put it on his head and put a reed in his right hand. And kneeling before him, they mocked him, saying, Hail, King of the Jews! ^2729

And they spit on him and took the reed and struck him on the head. ^2730

And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the robe and put his own clothes on him and led him away to crucify him. ^2731

As they went out, they found a man of Cyrene, Simon by name. They compelled this man to carry his cross. ^2732

And when they came to a place called Golgotha (which means Place of a Skull), ^2733

they offered him wine to drink, mixed with gall, but when he tasted it, he would not drink it. ^2734

And when they had crucified him, they divided his garments among them by casting lots. ^2735

Then they sat down and kept watch over him there. ^2736

And over his head they put the charge against him, which read, This is Jesus, the King of the Jews. ^2737

Then two robbers were crucified with him, one on the right and one on the left. ^2738

And those who passed by derided him, wagging their heads ^2739

and saying, You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, save yourself! If you are the Son of God, come down from the cross. ^2740

So also the chief priests, with the scribes and elders, mocked him, saying, ^2741

He saved others; he cannot save himself. He is the King of Israel; let him come down now from the cross, and we will believe in him. ^2742

He trusts in God; let God deliver him now, if he desires him. For he said, 'I am the Son of God.' ^2743

And the robbers who were crucified with him also reviled him in the same way. ^2744

Now from the sixth hour there was darkness over all the land until the ninth hour. ^2745

And about the ninth hour Jesus cried out with a loud voice, saying, Eli, Eli, lema sabachthani? that is, My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? ^2746

And some of the bystanders, hearing it, said, This man is calling Elijah. ^2747

And one of them at once ran and took a sponge, filled it with sour wine, and put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink. ^2748

But the others said, Wait, let us see whether Elijah will come to save him. ^2749

And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice and yielded up his spirit. ^2750

And behold, the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom. And the earth shook, and the rocks were split. ^2751

The tombs also were opened. And many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised, ^2752

and coming out of the tombs after his resurrection they went into the holy city and appeared to many. ^2753

When the centurion and those who were with him, keeping watch over Jesus, saw the earthquake and what took place, they were filled with awe and said, Truly this was the Son of God! ^2754

There were also many women there, looking on from a distance, who had followed Jesus from Galilee, ministering to him, ^2755

among whom were Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Joseph and the mother of the sons of Zebedee. ^2756

When it was evening, there came a rich man from Arimathea, named Joseph, who also was a disciple of Jesus. ^2757

He went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. Then Pilate ordered it to be given to him. ^2758

And Joseph took the body and wrapped it in a clean linen shroud ^2759

and laid it in his own new tomb, which he had cut in the rock. And he rolled a great stone to the entrance of the tomb and went away. ^2760

Mary Magdalene and the other Mary were there, sitting opposite the tomb. ^2761

Next day, that is, after the day of Preparation, the chief priests and the Pharisees gathered before Pilate ^2762

and said, Sir, we remember how that impostor said, while he was still alive, 'After three days I will rise.' ^2763

Therefore order the tomb to be made secure until the third day, lest his disciples go and steal him away and tell the people, 'He has risen from the dead,' and the last fraud will be worse than the first. ^2764

Pilate said to them, You have a guard of soldiers. Go, make it as secure as you can. ^2765

So they went and made the tomb secure by sealing the stone and setting a guard. ^2766


Now after the Sabbath, toward the dawn of the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to see the tomb. ^2801

And behold, there was a great earthquake, for an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and came and rolled back the stone and sat on it. ^2802

His appearance was like lightning, and his clothing white as snow. ^2803

And for fear of him the guards trembled and became like dead men. ^2804

But the angel said to the women, Do not be afraid, for I know that you seek Jesus who was crucified. ^2805

He is not here, for he has risen, as he said. Come, see the place where he lay. ^2806

Then go quickly and tell his disciples that he has risen from the dead, and behold, he is going before you to Galilee; there you will see him. See, I have told you. ^2807

So they departed quickly from the tomb with fear and great joy, and ran to tell his disciples. ^2808

And behold, Jesus met them and said, Greetings! And they came up and took hold of his feet and worshiped him. ^2809

Then Jesus said to them, Do not be afraid; go and tell my brothers to go to Galilee, and there they will see me. ^2810

While they were going, behold, some of the guard went into the city and told the chief priests all that had taken place. ^2811

And when they had assembled with the elders and taken counsel, they gave a sufficient sum of money to the soldiers ^2812

and said, Tell people, 'His disciples came by night and stole him away while we were asleep.' ^2813

And if this comes to the governor's ears, we will satisfy him and keep you out of trouble. ^2814

So they took the money and did as they were directed. And this story has been spread among the Jews to this day. ^2815

Now the eleven disciples went to Galilee, to the mountain to which Jesus had directed them. ^2816

And when they saw him they worshiped him, but some doubted. ^2817

And Jesus came and said to them, All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. ^2818

Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, ^2819

teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age. ^2820
