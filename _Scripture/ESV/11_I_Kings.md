Now King David was old and advanced in years. And although they covered him with clothes, he could not get warm. ^0101

Therefore his servants said to him, Let a young woman be sought for my lord the king, and let her wait on the king and be in his service. Let her lie in your arms, that my lord the king may be warm. ^0102

So they sought for a beautiful young woman throughout all the territory of Israel, and found Abishag the Shunammite, and brought her to the king. ^0103

The young woman was very beautiful, and she was of service to the king and attended to him, but the king knew her not. ^0104

Now Adonijah the son of Haggith exalted himself, saying, I will be king. And he prepared for himself chariots and horsemen, and fifty men to run before him. ^0105

His father had never at any time displeased him by asking, Why have you done thus and so? He was also a very handsome man, and he was born next after Absalom. ^0106

He conferred with Joab the son of Zeruiah and with Abiathar the priest. And they followed Adonijah and helped him. ^0107

But Zadok the priest and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada and Nathan the prophet and Shimei and Rei and David’s mighty men were not with Adonijah. ^0108

Adonijah sacrificed sheep, oxen, and fattened cattle by the Serpent’s Stone, which is beside En-rogel, and he invited all his brothers, the king’s sons, and all the royal officials of Judah, ^0109

but he did not invite Nathan the prophet or Benaiah or the mighty men or Solomon his brother. ^0110

Then Nathan said to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon, Have you not heard that Adonijah the son of Haggith has become king and David our lord does not know it? ^0111

Now therefore come, let me give you advice, that you may save your own life and the life of your son Solomon. ^0112

Go in at once to King David, and say to him, Did you not, my lord the king, swear to your servant, saying, Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne? Why then is Adonijah king? ^0113

Then while you are still speaking with the king, I also will come in after you and confirm your words. ^0114

So Bathsheba went to the king in his chamber (now the king was very old, and Abishag the Shunammite was attending to the king ). ^0115

Bathsheba bowed and paid homage to the king, and the king said, What do you desire? ^0116

She said to him, My lord, you swore to your servant by the Lord your God, saying, Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne. ^0117

And now, behold, Adonijah is king, although you, my lord the king, do not know it. ^0118

He has sacrificed oxen, fattened cattle, and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the sons of the king, Abiathar the priest, and Joab the commander of the army, but Solomon your servant he has not invited. ^0119

And now, my lord the king, the eyes of all Israel are on you, to tell them who shall sit on the throne of my lord the king after him. ^0120

Otherwise it will come to pass, when my lord the king sleeps with his fathers, that I and my son Solomon will be counted offenders. ^0121

While she was still speaking with the king, Nathan the prophet came in. ^0122

And they told the king, Here is Nathan the prophet. And when he came in before the king, he bowed before the king, with his face to the ground. ^0123

And Nathan said, My lord the king, have you said, Adonijah shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne? ^0124

For he has gone down this day and has sacrificed oxen, fattened cattle, and sheep in abundance, and has invited all the king’s sons, the commanders of the army, and Abiathar the priest. And behold, they are eating and drinking before him, and saying, Long live King Adonijah! ^0125

But me, your servant, and Zadok the priest, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and your servant Solomon he has not invited. ^0126

Has this thing been brought about by my lord the king and you have not told your servants who should sit on the throne of my lord the king after him? ^0127

Then King David answered, Call Bathsheba to me. So she came into the king’s presence and stood before the king. ^0128

And the king swore, saying, As the Lord lives, who has redeemed my soul out of every adversity, ^0129

as I swore to you by the Lord, the God of Israel, saying, Solomon your son shall reign after me, and he shall sit on my throne in my place, even so will I do this day. ^0130

Then Bathsheba bowed with her face to the ground and paid homage to the king and said, May my lord King David live forever! ^0131

King David said, Call to me Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada. So they came before the king. ^0132

And the king said to them, Take with you the servants of your lord and have Solomon my son ride on my own mule, and bring him down to Gihon. ^0133

And let Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet there anoint him king over Israel. Then blow the trumpet and say, Long live King Solomon! ^0134

You shall then come up after him, and he shall come and sit on my throne, for he shall be king in my place. And I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah. ^0135

And Benaiah the son of Jehoiada answered the king, Amen! May the Lord, the God of my lord the king, say so. ^0136

As the Lord has been with my lord the king, even so may he be with Solomon, and make his throne greater than the throne of my lord King David. ^0137

So Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites went down and had Solomon ride on King David’s mule and brought him to Gihon. ^0138

There Zadok the priest took the horn of oil from the tent and anointed Solomon. Then they blew the trumpet, and all the people said, Long live King Solomon! ^0139

And all the people went up after him, playing on pipes, and rejoicing with great joy, so that the earth was split by their noise. ^0140

Adonijah and all the guests who were with him heard it as they finished feasting. And when Joab heard the sound of the trumpet, he said, What does this uproar in the city mean? ^0141

While he was still speaking, behold, Jonathan the son of Abiathar the priest came. And Adonijah said, Come in, for you are a worthy man and bring good news. ^0142

Jonathan answered Adonijah, No, for our lord King David has made Solomon king, ^0143

and the king has sent with him Zadok the priest, Nathan the prophet, and Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and the Cherethites and the Pelethites. And they had him ride on the king’s mule. ^0144

And Zadok the priest and Nathan the prophet have anointed him king at Gihon, and they have gone up from there rejoicing, so that the city is in an uproar. This is the noise that you have heard. ^0145

Solomon sits on the royal throne. ^0146

Moreover, the king’s servants came to congratulate our lord King David, saying, May your God make the name of Solomon more famous than yours, and make his throne greater than your throne. And the king bowed himself on the bed. ^0147

And the king also said, Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, who has granted someone to sit on my throne this day, my own eyes seeing it. ^0148

Then all the guests of Adonijah trembled and rose, and each went his own way. ^0149

And Adonijah feared Solomon. So he arose and went and took hold of the horns of the altar. ^0150

Then it was told Solomon, Behold, Adonijah fears King Solomon, for behold, he has laid hold of the horns of the altar, saying, Let King Solomon swear to me first that he will not put his servant to death with the sword. ^0151

And Solomon said, If he will show himself a worthy man, not one of his hairs shall fall to the earth, but if wickedness is found in him, he shall die. ^0152

So King Solomon sent, and they brought him down from the altar. And he came and paid homage to King Solomon, and Solomon said to him, Go to your house. ^0153



When David’s time to die drew near, he commanded Solomon his son, saying, ^0201

I am about to go the way of all the earth. Be strong, and show yourself a man, ^0202

and keep the charge of the Lord your God, walking in his ways and keeping his statutes, his commandments, his rules, and his testimonies, as it is written in the Law of Moses, that you may prosper in all that you do and wherever you turn, ^0203

that the Lord may establish his word that he spoke concerning me, saying, If your sons pay close attention to their way, to walk before me in faithfulness with all their heart and with all their soul, you shall not lack a man on the throne of Israel. ^0204

Moreover, you also know what Joab the son of Zeruiah did to me, how he dealt with the two commanders of the armies of Israel, Abner the son of Ner, and Amasa the son of Jether, whom he killed, avenging in time of peace for blood that had been shed in war, and putting the blood of war on the belt around his waist and on the sandals on his feet. ^0205

Act therefore according to your wisdom, but do not let his gray head go down to Sheol in peace. ^0206

But deal loyally with the sons of Barzillai the Gileadite, and let them be among those who eat at your table, for with such loyalty they met me when I fled from Absalom your brother. ^0207

And there is also with you Shimei the son of Gera, the Benjaminite from Bahurim, who cursed me with a grievous curse on the day when I went to Mahanaim. But when he came down to meet me at the Jordan, I swore to him by the Lord, saying, I will not put you to death with the sword. ^0208

Now therefore do not hold him guiltless, for you are a wise man. You will know what you ought to do to him, and you shall bring his gray head down with blood to Sheol. ^0209

Then David slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of David. ^0210

And the time that David reigned over Israel was forty years. He reigned seven years in Hebron and thirty-three years in Jerusalem. ^0211

So Solomon sat on the throne of David his father, and his kingdom was firmly established. ^0212

Then Adonijah the son of Haggith came to Bathsheba the mother of Solomon. And she said, Do you come peacefully? He said, Peacefully. ^0213

Then he said, I have something to say to you. She said, Speak. ^0214

He said, You know that the kingdom was mine, and that all Israel fully expected me to reign. However, the kingdom has turned about and become my brother’s, for it was his from the Lord. ^0215

And now I have one request to make of you; do not refuse me. She said to him, Speak. ^0216

And he said, Please ask King Solomon — he will not refuse you —to give me Abishag the Shunammite as my wife. ^0217

Bathsheba said, Very well; I will speak for you to the king. ^0218

So Bathsheba went to King Solomon to speak to him on behalf of Adonijah. And the king rose to meet her and bowed down to her. Then he sat on his throne and had a seat brought for the king’s mother, and she sat on his right. ^0219

Then she said, I have one small request to make of you; do not refuse me. And the king said to her, Make your request, my mother, for I will not refuse you. ^0220

She said, Let Abishag the Shunammite be given to Adonijah your brother as his wife. ^0221

King Solomon answered his mother, And why do you ask Abishag the Shunammite for Adonijah? Ask for him the kingdom also, for he is my older brother, and on his side are Abiathar the priest and Joab the son of Zeruiah. ^0222

Then King Solomon swore by the Lord, saying, God do so to me and more also if this word does not cost Adonijah his life! ^0223

Now therefore as the Lord lives, who has established me and placed me on the throne of David my father, and who has made me a house, as he promised, Adonijah shall be put to death today. ^0224

So King Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and he struck him down, and he died. ^0225

And to Abiathar the priest the king said, Go to Anathoth, to your estate, for you deserve death. But I will not at this time put you to death, because you carried the ark of the Lord God before David my father, and because you shared in all my father’s affliction. ^0226

So Solomon expelled Abiathar from being priest to the Lord, thus fulfilling the word of the Lord that he had spoken concerning the house of Eli in Shiloh. ^0227

When the news came to Joab — for Joab had supported Adonijah although he had not supported Absalom — Joab fled to the tent of the Lord and caught hold of the horns of the altar. ^0228

And when it was told King Solomon, Joab has fled to the tent of the Lord, and behold, he is beside the altar, Solomon sent Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, saying, Go, strike him down. ^0229

So Benaiah came to the tent of the Lord and said to him, The king commands, Come out. But he said, No, I will die here. Then Benaiah brought the king word again, saying, Thus said Joab, and thus he answered me. ^0230

The king replied to him, Do as he has said, strike him down and bury him, and thus take away from me and from my father’s house the guilt for the blood that Joab shed without cause. ^0231

The Lord will bring back his bloody deeds on his own head, because, without the knowledge of my father David, he attacked and killed with the sword two men more righteous and better than himself, Abner the son of Ner, commander of the army of Israel, and Amasa the son of Jether, commander of the army of Judah. ^0232

So shall their blood come back on the head of Joab and on the head of his descendants forever. But for David and for his descendants and for his house and for his throne there shall be peace from the Lord forevermore. ^0233

Then Benaiah the son of Jehoiada went up and struck him down and put him to death. And he was buried in his own house in the wilderness. ^0234

The king put Benaiah the son of Jehoiada over the army in place of Joab, and the king put Zadok the priest in the place of Abiathar. ^0235

Then the king sent and summoned Shimei and said to him, Build yourself a house in Jerusalem and dwell there, and do not go out from there to any place whatever. ^0236

For on the day you go out and cross the brook Kidron, know for certain that you shall die. Your blood shall be on your own head. ^0237

And Shimei said to the king, What you say is good; as my lord the king has said, so will your servant do. So Shimei lived in Jerusalem many days. ^0238

But it happened at the end of three years that two of Shimei’s servants ran away to Achish, son of Maacah, king of Gath. And when it was told Shimei, Behold, your servants are in Gath, ^0239

Shimei arose and saddled a donkey and went to Gath to Achish to seek his servants. Shimei went and brought his servants from Gath. ^0240

And when Solomon was told that Shimei had gone from Jerusalem to Gath and returned, ^0241

the king sent and summoned Shimei and said to him, Did I not make you swear by the Lord and solemnly warn you, saying, Know for certain that on the day you go out and go to any place whatever, you shall die? And you said to me, What you say is good; I will obey. ^0242

Why then have you not kept your oath to the Lord and the commandment with which I commanded you? ^0243

The king also said to Shimei, You know in your own heart all the harm that you did to David my father. So the Lord will bring back your harm on your own head. ^0244

But King Solomon shall be blessed, and the throne of David shall be established before the Lord forever. ^0245

Then the king commanded Benaiah the son of Jehoiada, and he went out and struck him down, and he died. So the kingdom was established in the hand of Solomon. ^0246



Solomon made a marriage alliance with Pharaoh king of Egypt. He took Pharaoh’s daughter and brought her into the city of David until he had finished building his own house and the house of the Lord and the wall around Jerusalem. ^0301

The people were sacrificing at the high places, however, because no house had yet been built for the name of the Lord. ^0302

Solomon loved the Lord, walking in the statutes of David his father, only he sacrificed and made offerings at the high places. ^0303

And the king went to Gibeon to sacrifice there, for that was the great high place. Solomon used to offer a thousand burnt offerings on that altar. ^0304

At Gibeon the Lord appeared to Solomon in a dream by night, and God said, Ask what I shall give you. ^0305

And Solomon said, You have shown great and steadfast love to your servant David my father, because he walked before you in faithfulness, in righteousness, and in uprightness of heart toward you. And you have kept for him this great and steadfast love and have given him a son to sit on his throne this day. ^0306

And now, O Lord my God, you have made your servant king in place of David my father, although I am but a little child. I do not know how to go out or come in. ^0307

And your servant is in the midst of your people whom you have chosen, a great people, too many to be numbered or counted for multitude. ^0308

Give your servant therefore an understanding mind to govern your people, that I may discern between good and evil, for who is able to govern this your great people? ^0309

It pleased the Lord that Solomon had asked this. ^0310

And God said to him, Because you have asked this, and have not asked for yourself long life or riches or the life of your enemies, but have asked for yourself understanding to discern what is right, ^0311

behold, I now do according to your word. Behold, I give you a wise and discerning mind, so that none like you has been before you and none like you shall arise after you. ^0312

I give you also what you have not asked, both riches and honor, so that no other king shall compare with you, all your days. ^0313

And if you will walk in my ways, keeping my statutes and my commandments, as your father David walked, then I will lengthen your days. ^0314

And Solomon awoke, and behold, it was a dream. Then he came to Jerusalem and stood before the ark of the covenant of the Lord, and offered up burnt offerings and peace offerings, and made a feast for all his servants. ^0315

Then two prostitutes came to the king and stood before him. ^0316

The one woman said, Oh, my lord, this woman and I live in the same house, and I gave birth to a child while she was in the house. ^0317

Then on the third day after I gave birth, this woman also gave birth. And we were alone. There was no one else with us in the house; only we two were in the house. ^0318

And this woman’s son died in the night, because she lay on him. ^0319

And she arose at midnight and took my son from beside me, while your servant slept, and laid him at her breast, and laid her dead son at my breast. ^0320

When I rose in the morning to nurse my child, behold, he was dead. But when I looked at him closely in the morning, behold, he was not the child that I had borne. ^0321

But the other woman said, No, the living child is mine, and the dead child is yours. The first said, No, the dead child is yours, and the living child is mine. Thus they spoke before the king. ^0322

Then the king said, The one says, This is my son that is alive, and your son is dead; and the other says, No; but your son is dead, and my son is the living one. ^0323

And the king said, Bring me a sword. So a sword was brought before the king. ^0324

And the king said, Divide the living child in two, and give half to the one and half to the other. ^0325

Then the woman whose son was alive said to the king, because her heart yearned for her son, Oh, my lord, give her the living child, and by no means put him to death. But the other said, He shall be neither mine nor yours; divide him. ^0326

Then the king answered and said, Give the living child to the first woman, and by no means put him to death; she is his mother. ^0327

And all Israel heard of the judgment that the king had rendered, and they stood in awe of the king, because they perceived that the wisdom of God was in him to do justice. ^0328



King Solomon was king over all Israel, ^0401

and these were his high officials : Azariah the son of Zadok was the priest; ^0402

Elihoreph and Ahijah the sons of Shisha were secretaries; Jehoshaphat the son of Ahilud was recorder; ^0403

Benaiah the son of Jehoiada was in command of the army; Zadok and Abiathar were priests; ^0404

Azariah the son of Nathan was over the officers; Zabud the son of Nathan was priest and king’s friend; ^0405

Ahishar was in charge of the palace; and Adoniram the son of Abda was in charge of the forced labor. ^0406

Solomon had twelve officers over all Israel, who provided food for the king and his household. Each man had to make provision for one month in the year. ^0407

These were their names : Ben-hur, in the hill country of Ephraim; ^0408

Ben-deker, in Makaz, Shaalbim, Beth-shemesh, and Elonbeth-hanan; ^0409

Ben-hesed, in Arubboth (to him belonged Socoh and all the land of Hepher ); ^0410

Ben-abinadab, in all Naphath-dor ( he had Taphath the daughter of Solomon as his wife ); ^0411

Baana the son of Ahilud, in Taanach, Megiddo, and all Beth-shean that is beside Zarethan below Jezreel, and from Beth-shean to Abel-meholah, as far as the other side of Jokmeam; ^0412

Ben-geber, in Ramoth-gilead (he had the villages of Jair the son of Manasseh, which are in Gilead, and he had the region of Argob, which is in Bashan, sixty great cities with walls and bronze bars ); ^0413

Ahinadab the son of Iddo, in Mahanaim; ^0414

Ahimaaz, in Naphtali (he had taken Basemath the daughter of Solomon as his wife ); ^0415

Baana the son of Hushai, in Asher and Bealoth; ^0416

Jehoshaphat the son of Paruah, in Issachar; ^0417

Shimei the son of Ela, in Benjamin; ^0418

Geber the son of Uri, in the land of Gilead, the country of Sihon king of the Amorites and of Og king of Bashan. And there was one governor who was over the land. ^0419

Judah and Israel were as many as the sand by the sea. They ate and drank and were happy. ^0420

Solomon ruled over all the kingdoms from the Euphrates to the land of the Philistines and to the border of Egypt. They brought tribute and served Solomon all the days of his life. ^0421

Solomon’s provision for one day was thirty cors of fine flour and sixty cors of meal, ^0422

ten fat oxen, and twenty pasture-fed cattle, a hundred sheep, besides deer, gazelles, roebucks, and fattened fowl. ^0423

For he had dominion over all the region west of the Euphrates from Tiphsah to Gaza, over all the kings west of the Euphrates. And he had peace on all sides around him. ^0424

And Judah and Israel lived in safety, from Dan even to Beersheba, every man under his vine and under his fig tree, all the days of Solomon. ^0425

Solomon also had 40,000 stalls of horses for his chariots, and 12,000 horsemen. ^0426

And those officers supplied provisions for King Solomon, and for all who came to King Solomon’s table, each one in his month. They let nothing be lacking. ^0427

Barley also and straw for the horses and swift steeds they brought to the place where it was required, each according to his duty. ^0428

And God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding beyond measure, and breadth of mind like the sand on the seashore, ^0429

so that Solomon’s wisdom surpassed the wisdom of all the people of the east and all the wisdom of Egypt. ^0430

For he was wiser than all other men, wiser than Ethan the Ezrahite, and Heman, Calcol, and Darda, the sons of Mahol, and his fame was in all the surrounding nations. ^0431

He also spoke 3,000 proverbs, and his songs were 1,005. ^0432

He spoke of trees, from the cedar that is in Lebanon to the hyssop that grows out of the wall. He spoke also of beasts, and of birds, and of reptiles, and of fish. ^0433

And people of all nations came to hear the wisdom of Solomon, and from all the kings of the earth, who had heard of his wisdom. ^0434



Now Hiram king of Tyre sent his servants to Solomon when he heard that they had anointed him king in place of his father, for Hiram always loved David. ^0501

And Solomon sent word to Hiram, ^0502

You know that David my father could not build a house for the name of the Lord his God because of the warfare with which his enemies surrounded him, until the Lord put them under the soles of his feet. ^0503

But now the Lord my God has given me rest on every side. There is neither adversary nor misfortune. ^0504

And so I intend to build a house for the name of the Lord my God, as the Lord said to David my father, Your son, whom I will set on your throne in your place, shall build the house for my name. ^0505

Now therefore command that cedars of Lebanon be cut for me. And my servants will join your servants, and I will pay you for your servants such wages as you set, for you know that there is no one among us who knows how to cut timber like the Sidonians. ^0506

As soon as Hiram heard the words of Solomon, he rejoiced greatly and said, Blessed be the Lord this day, who has given to David a wise son to be over this great people. ^0507

And Hiram sent to Solomon, saying, I have heard the message that you have sent to me. I am ready to do all you desire in the matter of cedar and cypress timber. ^0508

My servants shall bring it down to the sea from Lebanon, and I will make it into rafts to go by sea to the place you direct. And I will have them broken up there, and you shall receive it. And you shall meet my wishes by providing food for my household. ^0509

So Hiram supplied Solomon with all the timber of cedar and cypress that he desired, ^0510

while Solomon gave Hiram 20,000 cors of wheat as food for his household, and 20,000 cors of beaten oil. Solomon gave this to Hiram year by year. ^0511

And the Lord gave Solomon wisdom, as he promised him. And there was peace between Hiram and Solomon, and the two of them made a treaty. ^0512

King Solomon drafted forced labor out of all Israel, and the draft numbered 30,000 men. ^0513

And he sent them to Lebanon, 10,000 a month in shifts. They would be a month in Lebanon and two months at home. Adoniram was in charge of the draft. ^0514

Solomon also had 70,000 burden-bearers and 80,000 stonecutters in the hill country, ^0515

besides Solomon’s 3,300 chief officers who were over the work, who had charge of the people who carried on the work. ^0516

At the king’s command they quarried out great, costly stones in order to lay the foundation of the house with dressed stones. ^0517

So Solomon’s builders and Hiram’s builders and the men of Gebal did the cutting and prepared the timber and the stone to build the house. ^0518



In the four hundred and eightieth year after the people of Israel came out of the land of Egypt, in the fourth year of Solomon’s reign over Israel, in the month of Ziv, which is the second month, he began to build the house of the Lord. ^0601

The house that King Solomon built for the Lord was sixty cubits long, twenty cubits wide, and thirty cubits high. ^0602

The vestibule in front of the nave of the house was twenty cubits long, equal to the width of the house, and ten cubits deep in front of the house. ^0603

And he made for the house windows with recessed frames. ^0604

He also built a structure against the wall of the house, running around the walls of the house, both the nave and the inner sanctuary. And he made side chambers all around. ^0605

The lowest story was five cubits broad, the middle one was six cubits broad, and the third was seven cubits broad. For around the outside of the house he made offsets on the wall in order that the supporting beams should not be inserted into the walls of the house. ^0606

When the house was built, it was with stone prepared at the quarry, so that neither hammer nor axe nor any tool of iron was heard in the house while it was being built. ^0607

The entrance for the lowest story was on the south side of the house, and one went up by stairs to the middle story, and from the middle story to the third. ^0608

So he built the house and finished it, and he made the ceiling of the house of beams and planks of cedar. ^0609

He built the structure against the whole house, five cubits high, and it was joined to the house with timbers of cedar. ^0610

Now the word of the Lord came to Solomon, ^0611

Concerning this house that you are building, if you will walk in my statutes and obey my rules and keep all my commandments and walk in them, then I will establish my word with you, which I spoke to David your father. ^0612

And I will dwell among the children of Israel and will not forsake my people Israel. ^0613

So Solomon built the house and finished it. ^0614

He lined the walls of the house on the inside with boards of cedar. From the floor of the house to the walls of the ceiling, he covered them on the inside with wood, and he covered the floor of the house with boards of cypress. ^0615

He built twenty cubits of the rear of the house with boards of cedar from the floor to the walls, and he built this within as an inner sanctuary, as the Most Holy Place. ^0616

The house, that is, the nave in front of the inner sanctuary, was forty cubits long. ^0617

The cedar within the house was carved in the form of gourds and open flowers. All was cedar; no stone was seen. ^0618

The inner sanctuary he prepared in the innermost part of the house, to set there the ark of the covenant of the Lord. ^0619

The inner sanctuary was twenty cubits long, twenty cubits wide, and twenty cubits high, and he overlaid it with pure gold. He also overlaid an altar of cedar. ^0620

And Solomon overlaid the inside of the house with pure gold, and he drew chains of gold across, in front of the inner sanctuary, and overlaid it with gold. ^0621

And he overlaid the whole house with gold, until all the house was finished. Also the whole altar that belonged to the inner sanctuary he overlaid with gold. ^0622

In the inner sanctuary he made two cherubim of olivewood, each ten cubits high. ^0623

Five cubits was the length of one wing of the cherub, and five cubits the length of the other wing of the cherub; it was ten cubits from the tip of one wing to the tip of the other. ^0624

The other cherub also measured ten cubits; both cherubim had the same measure and the same form. ^0625

The height of one cherub was ten cubits, and so was that of the other cherub. ^0626

He put the cherubim in the innermost part of the house. And the wings of the cherubim were spread out so that a wing of one touched the one wall, and a wing of the other cherub touched the other wall; their other wings touched each other in the middle of the house. ^0627

And he overlaid the cherubim with gold. ^0628

Around all the walls of the house he carved engraved figures of cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, in the inner and outer rooms. ^0629

The floor of the house he overlaid with gold in the inner and outer rooms. ^0630

For the entrance to the inner sanctuary he made doors of olivewood; the lintel and the doorposts were five-sided. ^0631

He covered the two doors of olivewood with carvings of cherubim, palm trees, and open flowers. He overlaid them with gold and spread gold on the cherubim and on the palm trees. ^0632

So also he made for the entrance to the nave doorposts of olivewood, in the form of a square, ^0633

and two doors of cypress wood. The two leaves of the one door were folding, and the two leaves of the other door were folding. ^0634

On them he carved cherubim and palm trees and open flowers, and he overlaid them with gold evenly applied on the carved work. ^0635

He built the inner court with three courses of cut stone and one course of cedar beams. ^0636

In the fourth year the foundation of the house of the Lord was laid, in the month of Ziv. ^0637

And in the eleventh year, in the month of Bul, which is the eighth month, the house was finished in all its parts, and according to all its specifications. He was seven years in building it. ^0638



Solomon was building his own house thirteen years, and he finished his entire house. ^0701

He built the House of the Forest of Lebanon. Its length was a hundred cubits and its breadth fifty cubits and its height thirty cubits, and it was built on four rows of cedar pillars, with cedar beams on the pillars. ^0702

And it was covered with cedar above the chambers that were on the forty-five pillars, fifteen in each row. ^0703

There were window frames in three rows, and window opposite window in three tiers. ^0704

All the doorways and windows had square frames, and window was opposite window in three tiers. ^0705

And he made the Hall of Pillars; its length was fifty cubits, and its breadth thirty cubits. There was a porch in front with pillars, and a canopy in front of them. ^0706

And he made the Hall of the Throne where he was to pronounce judgment, even the Hall of Judgment. It was finished with cedar from floor to rafters. ^0707

His own house where he was to dwell, in the other court back of the hall, was of like workmanship. Solomon also made a house like this hall for Pharaoh’s daughter whom he had taken in marriage. ^0708

All these were made of costly stones, cut according to measure, sawed with saws, back and front, even from the foundation to the coping, and from the outside to the great court. ^0709

The foundation was of costly stones, huge stones, stones of eight and ten cubits. ^0710

And above were costly stones, cut according to measurement, and cedar. ^0711

The great court had three courses of cut stone all around, and a course of cedar beams; so had the inner court of the house of the Lord and the vestibule of the house. ^0712

And King Solomon sent and brought Hiram from Tyre. ^0713

He was the son of a widow of the tribe of Naphtali, and his father was a man of Tyre, a worker in bronze. And he was full of wisdom, understanding, and skill for making any work in bronze. He came to King Solomon and did all his work. ^0714

He cast two pillars of bronze. Eighteen cubits was the height of one pillar, and a line of twelve cubits measured its circumference. It was hollow, and its thickness was four fingers. The second pillar was the same. ^0715

He also made two capitals of cast bronze to set on the tops of the pillars. The height of the one capital was five cubits, and the height of the other capital was five cubits. ^0716

There were lattices of checker work with wreaths of chain work for the capitals on the tops of the pillars, a lattice for the one capital and a lattice for the other capital. ^0717

Likewise he made pomegranates in two rows around the one latticework to cover the capital that was on the top of the pillar, and he did the same with the other capital. ^0718

Now the capitals that were on the tops of the pillars in the vestibule were of lily-work, four cubits. ^0719

The capitals were on the two pillars and also above the rounded projection which was beside the latticework. There were two hundred pomegranates in two rows all around, and so with the other capital. ^0720

He set up the pillars at the vestibule of the temple. He set up the pillar on the south and called its name Jachin, and he set up the pillar on the north and called its name Boaz. ^0721

And on the tops of the pillars was lily-work. Thus the work of the pillars was finished. ^0722

Then he made the sea of cast metal. It was round, ten cubits from brim to brim, and five cubits high, and a line of thirty cubits measured its circumference. ^0723

Under its brim were gourds, for ten cubits, compassing the sea all around. The gourds were in two rows, cast with it when it was cast. ^0724

It stood on twelve oxen, three facing north, three facing west, three facing south, and three facing east. The sea was set on them, and all their rear parts were inward. ^0725

Its thickness was a handbreadth, and its brim was made like the brim of a cup, like the flower of a lily. It held two thousand baths. ^0726

He also made the ten stands of bronze. Each stand was four cubits long, four cubits wide, and three cubits high. ^0727

This was the construction of the stands : they had panels, and the panels were set in the frames, ^0728

and on the panels that were set in the frames were lions, oxen, and cherubim. On the frames, both above and below the lions and oxen, there were wreaths of beveled work. ^0729

Moreover, each stand had four bronze wheels and axles of bronze, and at the four corners were supports for a basin. The supports were cast with wreaths at the side of each. ^0730

Its opening was within a crown that projected upward one cubit. Its opening was round, as a pedestal is made, a cubit and a half deep. At its opening there were carvings, and its panels were square, not round. ^0731

And the four wheels were underneath the panels. The axles of the wheels were of one piece with the stands, and the height of a wheel was a cubit and a half. ^0732

The wheels were made like a chariot wheel; their axles, their rims, their spokes, and their hubs were all cast. ^0733

There were four supports at the four corners of each stand. The supports were of one piece with the stands. ^0734

And on the top of the stand there was a round band half a cubit high; and on the top of the stand its stays and its panels were of one piece with it. ^0735

And on the surfaces of its stays and on its panels, he carved cherubim, lions, and palm trees, according to the space of each, with wreaths all around. ^0736

After this manner he made the ten stands. All of them were cast alike, of the same measure and the same form. ^0737

And he made ten basins of bronze. Each basin held forty baths, each basin measured four cubits, and there was a basin for each of the ten stands. ^0738

And he set the stands, five on the south side of the house, and five on the north side of the house. And he set the sea at the southeast corner of the house. ^0739

Hiram also made the pots, the shovels, and the basins. So Hiram finished all the work that he did for King Solomon on the house of the Lord : ^0740

the two pillars, the two bowls of the capitals that were on the tops of the pillars, and the two latticeworks to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the tops of the pillars; ^0741

and the four hundred pomegranates for the two latticeworks, two rows of pomegranates for each latticework, to cover the two bowls of the capitals that were on the pillars; ^0742

the ten stands, and the ten basins on the stands; ^0743

and the one sea, and the twelve oxen underneath the sea. ^0744

Now the pots, the shovels, and the basins, all these vessels in the house of the Lord, which Hiram made for King Solomon, were of burnished bronze. ^0745

In the plain of the Jordan the king cast them, in the clay ground between Succoth and Zarethan. ^0746

And Solomon left all the vessels unweighed, because there were so many of them; the weight of the bronze was not ascertained. ^0747

So Solomon made all the vessels that were in the house of the Lord : the golden altar, the golden table for the bread of the Presence, ^0748

the lampstands of pure gold, five on the south side and five on the north, before the inner sanctuary; the flowers, the lamps, and the tongs, of gold; ^0749

the cups, snuffers, basins, dishes for incense, and fire pans, of pure gold; and the sockets of gold, for the doors of the innermost part of the house, the Most Holy Place, and for the doors of the nave of the temple. ^0750

Thus all the work that King Solomon did on the house of the Lord was finished. And Solomon brought in the things that David his father had dedicated, the silver, the gold, and the vessels, and stored them in the treasuries of the house of the Lord. ^0751



Then Solomon assembled the elders of Israel and all the heads of the tribes, the leaders of the fathers ’ houses of the people of Israel, before King Solomon in Jerusalem, to bring up the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of the city of David, which is Zion. ^0801

And all the men of Israel assembled to King Solomon at the feast in the month Ethanim, which is the seventh month. ^0802

And all the elders of Israel came, and the priests took up the ark. ^0803

And they brought up the ark of the Lord, the tent of meeting, and all the holy vessels that were in the tent; the priests and the Levites brought them up. ^0804

And King Solomon and all the congregation of Israel, who had assembled before him, were with him before the ark, sacrificing so many sheep and oxen that they could not be counted or numbered. ^0805

Then the priests brought the ark of the covenant of the Lord to its place in the inner sanctuary of the house, in the Most Holy Place, underneath the wings of the cherubim. ^0806

For the cherubim spread out their wings over the place of the ark, so that the cherubim overshadowed the ark and its poles. ^0807

And the poles were so long that the ends of the poles were seen from the Holy Place before the inner sanctuary; but they could not be seen from outside. And they are there to this day. ^0808

There was nothing in the ark except the two tablets of stone that Moses put there at Horeb, where the Lord made a covenant with the people of Israel, when they came out of the land of Egypt. ^0809

And when the priests came out of the Holy Place, a cloud filled the house of the Lord, ^0810

so that the priests could not stand to minister because of the cloud, for the glory of the Lord filled the house of the Lord. ^0811

Then Solomon said, The Lord has said that he would dwell in thick darkness. ^0812

I have indeed built you an exalted house, a place for you to dwell in forever. ^0813

Then the king turned around and blessed all the assembly of Israel, while all the assembly of Israel stood. ^0814

And he said, Blessed be the Lord, the God of Israel, who with his hand has fulfilled what he promised with his mouth to David my father, saying, ^0815

Since the day that I brought my people Israel out of Egypt, I chose no city out of all the tribes of Israel in which to build a house, that my name might be there. But I chose David to be over my people Israel. ^0816

Now it was in the heart of David my father to build a house for the name of the Lord, the God of Israel. ^0817

But the Lord said to David my father, Whereas it was in your heart to build a house for my name, you did well that it was in your heart. ^0818

Nevertheless, you shall not build the house, but your son who shall be born to you shall build the house for my name. ^0819

Now the Lord has fulfilled his promise that he made. For I have risen in the place of David my father, and sit on the throne of Israel, as the Lord promised, and I have built the house for the name of the Lord, the God of Israel. ^0820

And there I have provided a place for the ark, in which is the covenant of the Lord that he made with our fathers, when he brought them out of the land of Egypt. ^0821

Then Solomon stood before the altar of the Lord in the presence of all the assembly of Israel and spread out his hands toward heaven, ^0822

and said, O Lord, God of Israel, there is no God like you, in heaven above or on earth beneath, keeping covenant and showing steadfast love to your servants who walk before you with all their heart; ^0823

you have kept with your servant David my father what you declared to him. You spoke with your mouth, and with your hand have fulfilled it this day. ^0824

Now therefore, O Lord, God of Israel, keep for your servant David my father what you have promised him, saying, You shall not lack a man to sit before me on the throne of Israel, if only your sons pay close attention to their way, to walk before me as you have walked before me. ^0825

Now therefore, O God of Israel, let your word be confirmed, which you have spoken to your servant David my father. ^0826

But will God indeed dwell on the earth? Behold, heaven and the highest heaven cannot contain you; how much less this house that I have built! ^0827

Yet have regard to the prayer of your servant and to his plea, O Lord my God, listening to the cry and to the prayer that your servant prays before you this day, ^0828

that your eyes may be open night and day toward this house, the place of which you have said, My name shall be there, that you may listen to the prayer that your servant offers toward this place. ^0829

And listen to the plea of your servant and of your people Israel, when they pray toward this place. And listen in heaven your dwelling place, and when you hear, forgive. ^0830

If a man sins against his neighbor and is made to take an oath and comes and swears his oath before your altar in this house, ^0831

then hear in heaven and act and judge your servants, condemning the guilty by bringing his conduct on his own head, and vindicating the righteous by rewarding him according to his righteousness. ^0832

When your people Israel are defeated before the enemy because they have sinned against you, and if they turn again to you and acknowledge your name and pray and plead with you in this house, ^0833

then hear in heaven and forgive the sin of your people Israel and bring them again to the land that you gave to their fathers. ^0834

When heaven is shut up and there is no rain because they have sinned against you, if they pray toward this place and acknowledge your name and turn from their sin, when you afflict them, ^0835

then hear in heaven and forgive the sin of your servants, your people Israel, when you teach them the good way in which they should walk, and grant rain upon your land, which you have given to your people as an inheritance. ^0836

If there is famine in the land, if there is pestilence or blight or mildew or locust or caterpillar, if their enemy besieges them in the land at their gates, whatever plague, whatever sickness there is, ^0837

whatever prayer, whatever plea is made by any man or by all your people Israel, each knowing the affliction of his own heart and stretching out his hands toward this house, ^0838

then hear in heaven your dwelling place and forgive and act and render to each whose heart you know, according to all his ways ( for you, you only, know the hearts of all the children of mankind ), ^0839

that they may fear you all the days that they live in the land that you gave to our fathers. ^0840

Likewise, when a foreigner, who is not of your people Israel, comes from a far country for your name’s sake ^0841

(for they shall hear of your great name and your mighty hand, and of your outstretched arm ), when he comes and prays toward this house, ^0842

hear in heaven your dwelling place and do according to all for which the foreigner calls to you, in order that all the peoples of the earth may know your name and fear you, as do your people Israel, and that they may know that this house that I have built is called by your name. ^0843

If your people go out to battle against their enemy, by whatever way you shall send them, and they pray to the Lord toward the city that you have chosen and the house that I have built for your name, ^0844

then hear in heaven their prayer and their plea, and maintain their cause. ^0845

If they sin against you— for there is no one who does not sin —and you are angry with them and give them to an enemy, so that they are carried away captive to the land of the enemy, far off or near, ^0846

yet if they turn their heart in the land to which they have been carried captive, and repent and plead with you in the land of their captors, saying, We have sinned and have acted perversely and wickedly, ^0847

if they repent with all their mind and with all their heart in the land of their enemies, who carried them captive, and pray to you toward their land, which you gave to their fathers, the city that you have chosen, and the house that I have built for your name, ^0848

then hear in heaven your dwelling place their prayer and their plea, and maintain their cause ^0849

and forgive your people who have sinned against you, and all their transgressions that they have committed against you, and grant them compassion in the sight of those who carried them captive, that they may have compassion on them ^0850

( for they are your people, and your heritage, which you brought out of Egypt, from the midst of the iron furnace ). ^0851

Let your eyes be open to the plea of your servant and to the plea of your people Israel, giving ear to them whenever they call to you. ^0852

For you separated them from among all the peoples of the earth to be your heritage, as you declared through Moses your servant, when you brought our fathers out of Egypt, O Lord God. ^0853

Now as Solomon finished offering all this prayer and plea to the Lord, he arose from before the altar of the Lord, where he had knelt with hands outstretched toward heaven. ^0854

And he stood and blessed all the assembly of Israel with a loud voice, saying, ^0855

Blessed be the Lord who has given rest to his people Israel, according to all that he promised. Not one word has failed of all his good promise, which he spoke by Moses his servant. ^0856

The Lord our God be with us, as he was with our fathers. May he not leave us or forsake us, ^0857

that he may incline our hearts to him, to walk in all his ways and to keep his commandments, his statutes, and his rules, which he commanded our fathers. ^0858

Let these words of mine, with which I have pleaded before the Lord, be near to the Lord our God day and night, and may he maintain the cause of his servant and the cause of his people Israel, as each day requires, ^0859

that all the peoples of the earth may know that the Lord is God; there is no other. ^0860

Let your heart therefore be wholly true to the Lord our God, walking in his statutes and keeping his commandments, as at this day. ^0861

Then the king, and all Israel with him, offered sacrifice before the Lord. ^0862

Solomon offered as peace offerings to the Lord 22,000 oxen and 120,000 sheep. So the king and all the people of Israel dedicated the house of the Lord. ^0863

The same day the king consecrated the middle of the court that was before the house of the Lord, for there he offered the burnt offering and the grain offering and the fat pieces of the peace offerings, because the bronze altar that was before the Lord was too small to receive the burnt offering and the grain offering and the fat pieces of the peace offerings. ^0864

So Solomon held the feast at that time, and all Israel with him, a great assembly, from Lebo-hamath to the Brook of Egypt, before the Lord our God, seven days. ^0865

On the eighth day he sent the people away, and they blessed the king and went to their homes joyful and glad of heart for all the goodness that the Lord had shown to David his servant and to Israel his people. ^0866



As soon as Solomon had finished building the house of the Lord and the king’s house and all that Solomon desired to build, ^0901

the Lord appeared to Solomon a second time, as he had appeared to him at Gibeon. ^0902

And the Lord said to him, I have heard your prayer and your plea, which you have made before me. I have consecrated this house that you have built, by putting my name there forever. My eyes and my heart will be there for all time. ^0903

And as for you, if you will walk before me, as David your father walked, with integrity of heart and uprightness, doing according to all that I have commanded you, and keeping my statutes and my rules, ^0904

then I will establish your royal throne over Israel forever, as I promised David your father, saying, You shall not lack a man on the throne of Israel. ^0905

But if you turn aside from following me, you or your children, and do not keep my commandments and my statutes that I have set before you, but go and serve other gods and worship them, ^0906

then I will cut off Israel from the land that I have given them, and the house that I have consecrated for my name I will cast out of my sight, and Israel will become a proverb and a byword among all peoples. ^0907

And this house will become a heap of ruins. Everyone passing by it will be astonished and will hiss, and they will say, Why has the Lord done thus to this land and to this house? ^0908

Then they will say, Because they abandoned the Lord their God who brought their fathers out of the land of Egypt and laid hold on other gods and worshiped them and served them. Therefore the Lord has brought all this disaster on them. ^0909

At the end of twenty years, in which Solomon had built the two houses, the house of the Lord and the king’s house, ^0910

and Hiram king of Tyre had supplied Solomon with cedar and cypress timber and gold, as much as he desired, King Solomon gave to Hiram twenty cities in the land of Galilee. ^0911

But when Hiram came from Tyre to see the cities that Solomon had given him, they did not please him. ^0912

Therefore he said, What kind of cities are these that you have given me, my brother? So they are called the land of Cabul to this day. ^0913

Hiram had sent to the king 120 talents of gold. ^0914

And this is the account of the forced labor that King Solomon drafted to build the house of the Lord and his own house and the Millo and the wall of Jerusalem and Hazor and Megiddo and Gezer ^0915

( Pharaoh king of Egypt had gone up and captured Gezer and burned it with fire, and had killed the Canaanites who lived in the city, and had given it as dowry to his daughter, Solomon’s wife; ^0916

so Solomon rebuilt Gezer ) and Lower Beth-horon ^0917

and Baalath and Tamar in the wilderness, in the land of Judah, ^0918

and all the store cities that Solomon had, and the cities for his chariots, and the cities for his horsemen, and whatever Solomon desired to build in Jerusalem, in Lebanon, and in all the land of his dominion. ^0919

All the people who were left of the Amorites, the Hittites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites, who were not of the people of Israel — ^0920

their descendants who were left after them in the land, whom the people of Israel were unable to devote to destruction — these Solomon drafted to be slaves, and so they are to this day. ^0921

But of the people of Israel Solomon made no slaves. They were the soldiers, they were his officials, his commanders, his captains, his chariot commanders and his horsemen. ^0922

These were the chief officers who were over Solomon’s work : 550 who had charge of the people who carried on the work. ^0923

But Pharaoh’s daughter went up from the city of David to her own house that Solomon had built for her. Then he built the Millo. ^0924

Three times a year Solomon used to offer up burnt offerings and peace offerings on the altar that he built to the Lord, making offerings with it before the Lord. So he finished the house. ^0925

King Solomon built a fleet of ships at Ezion-geber, which is near Eloth on the shore of the Red Sea, in the land of Edom. ^0926

And Hiram sent with the fleet his servants, seamen who were familiar with the sea, together with the servants of Solomon. ^0927

And they went to Ophir and brought from there gold, 420 talents, and they brought it to King Solomon. ^0928



Now when the queen of Sheba heard of the fame of Solomon concerning the name of the Lord, she came to test him with hard questions. ^1001

She came to Jerusalem with a very great retinue, with camels bearing spices and very much gold and precious stones. And when she came to Solomon, she told him all that was on her mind. ^1002

And Solomon answered all her questions; there was nothing hidden from the king that he could not explain to her. ^1003

And when the queen of Sheba had seen all the wisdom of Solomon, the house that he had built, ^1004

the food of his table, the seating of his officials, and the attendance of his servants, their clothing, his cupbearers, and his burnt offerings that he offered at the house of the Lord, there was no more breath in her. ^1005

And she said to the king, The report was true that I heard in my own land of your words and of your wisdom, ^1006

but I did not believe the reports until I came and my own eyes had seen it. And behold, the half was not told me. Your wisdom and prosperity surpass the report that I heard. ^1007

Happy are your men! Happy are your servants, who continually stand before you and hear your wisdom! ^1008

Blessed be the Lord your God, who has delighted in you and set you on the throne of Israel! Because the Lord loved Israel forever, he has made you king, that you may execute justice and righteousness. ^1009

Then she gave the king 120 talents of gold, and a very great quantity of spices and precious stones. Never again came such an abundance of spices as these that the queen of Sheba gave to King Solomon. ^1010

Moreover, the fleet of Hiram, which brought gold from Ophir, brought from Ophir a very great amount of almug wood and precious stones. ^1011

And the king made of the almug wood supports for the house of the Lord and for the king’s house, also lyres and harps for the singers. No such almug wood has come or been seen to this day. ^1012

And King Solomon gave to the queen of Sheba all that she desired, whatever she asked besides what was given her by the bounty of King Solomon. So she turned and went back to her own land with her servants. ^1013

Now the weight of gold that came to Solomon in one year was 666 talents of gold, ^1014

besides that which came from the explorers and from the business of the merchants, and from all the kings of the west and from the governors of the land. ^1015

King Solomon made 200 large shields of beaten gold; 600 shekels of gold went into each shield. ^1016

And he made 300 shields of beaten gold; three minas of gold went into each shield. And the king put them in the House of the Forest of Lebanon. ^1017

The king also made a great ivory throne and overlaid it with the finest gold. ^1018

The throne had six steps, and the throne had a round top, and on each side of the seat were armrests and two lions standing beside the armrests, ^1019

while twelve lions stood there, one on each end of a step on the six steps. The like of it was never made in any kingdom. ^1020

All King Solomon’s drinking vessels were of gold, and all the vessels of the House of the Forest of Lebanon were of pure gold. None were of silver; silver was not considered as anything in the days of Solomon. ^1021

For the king had a fleet of ships of Tarshish at sea with the fleet of Hiram. Once every three years the fleet of ships of Tarshish used to come bringing gold, silver, ivory, apes, and peacocks. ^1022

Thus King Solomon excelled all the kings of the earth in riches and in wisdom. ^1023

And the whole earth sought the presence of Solomon to hear his wisdom, which God had put into his mind. ^1024

Every one of them brought his present, articles of silver and gold, garments, myrrh, spices, horses, and mules, so much year by year. ^1025

And Solomon gathered together chariots and horsemen. He had 1,400 chariots and 12,000 horsemen, whom he stationed in the chariot cities and with the king in Jerusalem. ^1026

And the king made silver as common in Jerusalem as stone, and he made cedar as plentiful as the sycamore of the Shephelah. ^1027

And Solomon’s import of horses was from Egypt and Kue, and the king’s traders received them from Kue at a price. ^1028

A chariot could be imported from Egypt for 600 shekels of silver and a horse for 150, and so through the king’s traders they were exported to all the kings of the Hittites and the kings of Syria. ^1029



Now King Solomon loved many foreign women, along with the daughter of Pharaoh : Moabite, Ammonite, Edomite, Sidonian, and Hittite women, ^1101

from the nations concerning which the Lord had said to the people of Israel, You shall not enter into marriage with them, neither shall they with you, for surely they will turn away your heart after their gods. Solomon clung to these in love. ^1102

He had 700 wives, who were princesses, and 300 concubines. And his wives turned away his heart. ^1103

For when Solomon was old his wives turned away his heart after other gods, and his heart was not wholly true to the Lord his God, as was the heart of David his father. ^1104

For Solomon went after Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, and after Milcom the abomination of the Ammonites. ^1105

So Solomon did what was evil in the sight of the Lord and did not wholly follow the Lord, as David his father had done. ^1106

Then Solomon built a high place for Chemosh the abomination of Moab, and for Molech the abomination of the Ammonites, on the mountain east of Jerusalem. ^1107

And so he did for all his foreign wives, who made offerings and sacrificed to their gods. ^1108

And the Lord was angry with Solomon, because his heart had turned away from the Lord, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice ^1109

and had commanded him concerning this thing, that he should not go after other gods. But he did not keep what the Lord commanded. ^1110

Therefore the Lord said to Solomon, Since this has been your practice and you have not kept my covenant and my statutes that I have commanded you, I will surely tear the kingdom from you and will give it to your servant. ^1111

Yet for the sake of David your father I will not do it in your days, but I will tear it out of the hand of your son. ^1112

However, I will not tear away all the kingdom, but I will give one tribe to your son, for the sake of David my servant and for the sake of Jerusalem that I have chosen. ^1113

And the Lord raised up an adversary against Solomon, Hadad the Edomite. He was of the royal house in Edom. ^1114

For when David was in Edom, and Joab the commander of the army went up to bury the slain, he struck down every male in Edom ^1115

( for Joab and all Israel remained there six months, until he had cut off every male in Edom ). ^1116

But Hadad fled to Egypt, together with certain Edomites of his father’s servants, Hadad still being a little child. ^1117

They set out from Midian and came to Paran and took men with them from Paran and came to Egypt, to Pharaoh king of Egypt, who gave him a house and assigned him an allowance of food and gave him land. ^1118

And Hadad found great favor in the sight of Pharaoh, so that he gave him in marriage the sister of his own wife, the sister of Tahpenes the queen. ^1119

And the sister of Tahpenes bore him Genubath his son, whom Tahpenes weaned in Pharaoh’s house. And Genubath was in Pharaoh’s house among the sons of Pharaoh. ^1120

But when Hadad heard in Egypt that David slept with his fathers and that Joab the commander of the army was dead, Hadad said to Pharaoh, Let me depart, that I may go to my own country. ^1121

But Pharaoh said to him, What have you lacked with me that you are now seeking to go to your own country? And he said to him, Only let me depart. ^1122

God also raised up as an adversary to him, Rezon the son of Eliada, who had fled from his master Hadadezer king of Zobah. ^1123

And he gathered men about him and became leader of a marauding band, after the killing by David. And they went to Damascus and lived there and made him king in Damascus. ^1124

He was an adversary of Israel all the days of Solomon, doing harm as Hadad did. And he loathed Israel and reigned over Syria. ^1125

Jeroboam the son of Nebat, an Ephraimite of Zeredah, a servant of Solomon, whose mother’s name was Zeruah, a widow, also lifted up his hand against the king. ^1126

And this was the reason why he lifted up his hand against the king. Solomon built the Millo, and closed up the breach of the city of David his father. ^1127

The man Jeroboam was very able, and when Solomon saw that the young man was industrious he gave him charge over all the forced labor of the house of Joseph. ^1128

And at that time, when Jeroboam went out of Jerusalem, the prophet Ahijah the Shilonite found him on the road. Now Ahijah had dressed himself in a new garment, and the two of them were alone in the open country. ^1129

Then Ahijah laid hold of the new garment that was on him, and tore it into twelve pieces. ^1130

And he said to Jeroboam, Take for yourself ten pieces, for thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, Behold, I am about to tear the kingdom from the hand of Solomon and will give you ten tribes ^1131

(but he shall have one tribe, for the sake of my servant David and for the sake of Jerusalem, the city that I have chosen out of all the tribes of Israel ), ^1132

because they have forsaken me and worshiped Ashtoreth the goddess of the Sidonians, Chemosh the god of Moab, and Milcom the god of the Ammonites, and they have not walked in my ways, doing what is right in my sight and keeping my statutes and my rules, as David his father did. ^1133

Nevertheless, I will not take the whole kingdom out of his hand, but I will make him ruler all the days of his life, for the sake of David my servant whom I chose, who kept my commandments and my statutes. ^1134

But I will take the kingdom out of his son’s hand and will give it to you, ten tribes. ^1135

Yet to his son I will give one tribe, that David my servant may always have a lamp before me in Jerusalem, the city where I have chosen to put my name. ^1136

And I will take you, and you shall reign over all that your soul desires, and you shall be king over Israel. ^1137

And if you will listen to all that I command you, and will walk in my ways, and do what is right in my eyes by keeping my statutes and my commandments, as David my servant did, I will be with you and will build you a sure house, as I built for David, and I will give Israel to you. ^1138

And I will afflict the offspring of David because of this, but not forever. ^1139

Solomon sought therefore to kill Jeroboam. But Jeroboam arose and fled into Egypt, to Shishak king of Egypt, and was in Egypt until the death of Solomon. ^1140

Now the rest of the acts of Solomon, and all that he did, and his wisdom, are they not written in the Book of the Acts of Solomon? ^1141

And the time that Solomon reigned in Jerusalem over all Israel was forty years. ^1142

And Solomon slept with his fathers and was buried in the city of David his father. And Rehoboam his son reigned in his place. ^1143



Rehoboam went to Shechem, for all Israel had come to Shechem to make him king. ^1201

And as soon as Jeroboam the son of Nebat heard of it (for he was still in Egypt, where he had fled from King Solomon ), then Jeroboam returned from Egypt. ^1202

And they sent and called him, and Jeroboam and all the assembly of Israel came and said to Rehoboam, ^1203

Your father made our yoke heavy. Now therefore lighten the hard service of your father and his heavy yoke on us, and we will serve you. ^1204

He said to them, Go away for three days, then come again to me. So the people went away. ^1205

Then King Rehoboam took counsel with the old men, who had stood before Solomon his father while he was yet alive, saying, How do you advise me to answer this people? ^1206

And they said to him, If you will be a servant to this people today and serve them, and speak good words to them when you answer them, then they will be your servants forever. ^1207

But he abandoned the counsel that the old men gave him and took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him and stood before him. ^1208

And he said to them, What do you advise that we answer this people who have said to me, Lighten the yoke that your father put on us? ^1209

And the young men who had grown up with him said to him, Thus shall you speak to this people who said to you, Your father made our yoke heavy, but you lighten it for us, thus shall you say to them, My little finger is thicker than my father’s thighs. ^1210

And now, whereas my father laid on you a heavy yoke, I will add to your yoke. My father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions. ^1211

So Jeroboam and all the people came to Rehoboam the third day, as the king said, Come to me again the third day. ^1212

And the king answered the people harshly, and forsaking the counsel that the old men had given him, ^1213

he spoke to them according to the counsel of the young men, saying, My father made your yoke heavy, but I will add to your yoke. My father disciplined you with whips, but I will discipline you with scorpions. ^1214

So the king did not listen to the people, for it was a turn of affairs brought about by the Lord that he might fulfill his word, which the Lord spoke by Ahijah the Shilonite to Jeroboam the son of Nebat. ^1215

And when all Israel saw that the king did not listen to them, the people answered the king, What portion do we have in David? We have no inheritance in the son of Jesse. To your tents, O Israel! Look now to your own house, David. So Israel went to their tents. ^1216

But Rehoboam reigned over the people of Israel who lived in the cities of Judah. ^1217

Then King Rehoboam sent Adoram, who was taskmaster over the forced labor, and all Israel stoned him to death with stones. And King Rehoboam hurried to mount his chariot to flee to Jerusalem. ^1218

So Israel has been in rebellion against the house of David to this day. ^1219

And when all Israel heard that Jeroboam had returned, they sent and called him to the assembly and made him king over all Israel. There was none that followed the house of David but the tribe of Judah only. ^1220

When Rehoboam came to Jerusalem, he assembled all the house of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin, 180,000 chosen warriors, to fight against the house of Israel, to restore the kingdom to Rehoboam the son of Solomon. ^1221

But the word of God came to Shemaiah the man of God : ^1222

Say to Rehoboam the son of Solomon, king of Judah, and to all the house of Judah and Benjamin, and to the rest of the people, ^1223

Thus says the Lord, You shall not go up or fight against your relatives the people of Israel. Every man return to his home, for this thing is from me. So they listened to the word of the Lord and went home again, according to the word of the Lord. ^1224

Then Jeroboam built Shechem in the hill country of Ephraim and lived there. And he went out from there and built Penuel. ^1225

And Jeroboam said in his heart, Now the kingdom will turn back to the house of David. ^1226

If this people go up to offer sacrifices in the temple of the Lord at Jerusalem, then the heart of this people will turn again to their lord, to Rehoboam king of Judah, and they will kill me and return to Rehoboam king of Judah. ^1227

So the king took counsel and made two calves of gold. And he said to the people, You have gone up to Jerusalem long enough. Behold your gods, O Israel, who brought you up out of the land of Egypt. ^1228

And he set one in Bethel, and the other he put in Dan. ^1229

Then this thing became a sin, for the people went as far as Dan to be before one. ^1230

He also made temples on high places and appointed priests from among all the people, who were not of the Levites. ^1231

And Jeroboam appointed a feast on the fifteenth day of the eighth month like the feast that was in Judah, and he offered sacrifices on the altar. So he did in Bethel, sacrificing to the calves that he made. And he placed in Bethel the priests of the high places that he had made. ^1232

He went up to the altar that he had made in Bethel on the fifteenth day in the eighth month, in the month that he had devised from his own heart. And he instituted a feast for the people of Israel and went up to the altar to make offerings. ^1233



And behold, a man of God came out of Judah by the word of the Lord to Bethel. Jeroboam was standing by the altar to make offerings. ^1301

And the man cried against the altar by the word of the Lord and said, O altar, altar, thus says the Lord : Behold, a son shall be born to the house of David, Josiah by name, and he shall sacrifice on you the priests of the high places who make offerings on you, and human bones shall be burned on you. ^1302

And he gave a sign the same day, saying, This is the sign that the Lord has spoken : Behold, the altar shall be torn down, and the ashes that are on it shall be poured out. ^1303

And when the king heard the saying of the man of God, which he cried against the altar at Bethel, Jeroboam stretched out his hand from the altar, saying, Seize him. And his hand, which he stretched out against him, dried up, so that he could not draw it back to himself. ^1304

The altar also was torn down, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign that the man of God had given by the word of the Lord. ^1305

And the king said to the man of God, Entreat now the favor of the Lord your God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored to me. And the man of God entreated the Lord, and the king’s hand was restored to him and became as it was before. ^1306

And the king said to the man of God, Come home with me, and refresh yourself, and I will give you a reward. ^1307

And the man of God said to the king, If you give me half your house, I will not go in with you. And I will not eat bread or drink water in this place, ^1308

for so was it commanded me by the word of the Lord, saying, You shall neither eat bread nor drink water nor return by the way that you came. ^1309

So he went another way and did not return by the way that he came to Bethel. ^1310

Now an old prophet lived in Bethel. And his sons came and told him all that the man of God had done that day in Bethel. They also told to their father the words that he had spoken to the king. ^1311

And their father said to them, Which way did he go? And his sons showed him the way that the man of God who came from Judah had gone. ^1312

And he said to his sons, Saddle the donkey for me. So they saddled the donkey for him and he mounted it. ^1313

And he went after the man of God and found him sitting under an oak. And he said to him, Are you the man of God who came from Judah? And he said, I am. ^1314

Then he said to him, Come home with me and eat bread. ^1315

And he said, I may not return with you, or go in with you, neither will I eat bread nor drink water with you in this place, ^1316

for it was said to me by the word of the Lord, You shall neither eat bread nor drink water there, nor return by the way that you came. ^1317

And he said to him, I also am a prophet as you are, and an angel spoke to me by the word of the Lord, saying, Bring him back with you into your house that he may eat bread and drink water. But he lied to him. ^1318

So he went back with him and ate bread in his house and drank water. ^1319

And as they sat at the table, the word of the Lord came to the prophet who had brought him back. ^1320

And he cried to the man of God who came from Judah, Thus says the Lord, Because you have disobeyed the word of the Lord and have not kept the command that the Lord your God commanded you, ^1321

but have come back and have eaten bread and drunk water in the place of which he said to you, Eat no bread and drink no water, your body shall not come to the tomb of your fathers. ^1322

And after he had eaten bread and drunk, he saddled the donkey for the prophet whom he had brought back. ^1323

And as he went away a lion met him on the road and killed him. And his body was thrown in the road, and the donkey stood beside it; the lion also stood beside the body. ^1324

And behold, men passed by and saw the body thrown in the road and the lion standing by the body. And they came and told it in the city where the old prophet lived. ^1325

And when the prophet who had brought him back from the way heard of it, he said, It is the man of God who disobeyed the word of the Lord; therefore the Lord has given him to the lion, which has torn him and killed him, according to the word that the Lord spoke to him. ^1326

And he said to his sons, Saddle the donkey for me. And they saddled it. ^1327

And he went and found his body thrown in the road, and the donkey and the lion standing beside the body. The lion had not eaten the body or torn the donkey. ^1328

And the prophet took up the body of the man of God and laid it on the donkey and brought it back to the city to mourn and to bury him. ^1329

And he laid the body in his own grave. And they mourned over him, saying, Alas, my brother! ^1330

And after he had buried him, he said to his sons, When I die, bury me in the grave in which the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones. ^1331

For the saying that he called out by the word of the Lord against the altar in Bethel and against all the houses of the high places that are in the cities of Samaria shall surely come to pass. ^1332

After this thing Jeroboam did not turn from his evil way, but made priests for the high places again from among all the people. Any who would, he ordained to be priests of the high places. ^1333

And this thing became sin to the house of Jeroboam, so as to cut it off and to destroy it from the face of the earth. ^1334



At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick. ^1401

And Jeroboam said to his wife, Arise, and disguise yourself, that it not be known that you are the wife of Jeroboam, and go to Shiloh. Behold, Ahijah the prophet is there, who said of me that I should be king over this people. ^1402

Take with you ten loaves, some cakes, and a jar of honey, and go to him. He will tell you what shall happen to the child. ^1403

Jeroboam’s wife did so. She arose and went to Shiloh and came to the house of Ahijah. Now Ahijah could not see, for his eyes were dim because of his age. ^1404

And the Lord said to Ahijah, Behold, the wife of Jeroboam is coming to inquire of you concerning her son, for he is sick. Thus and thus shall you say to her. When she came, she pretended to be another woman. ^1405

But when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she came in at the door, he said, Come in, wife of Jeroboam. Why do you pretend to be another? For I am charged with unbearable news for you. ^1406

Go, tell Jeroboam, Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel : Because I exalted you from among the people and made you leader over my people Israel ^1407

and tore the kingdom away from the house of David and gave it to you, and yet you have not been like my servant David, who kept my commandments and followed me with all his heart, doing only that which was right in my eyes, ^1408

but you have done evil above all who were before you and have gone and made for yourself other gods and metal images, provoking me to anger, and have cast me behind your back, ^1409

therefore behold, I will bring harm upon the house of Jeroboam and will cut off from Jeroboam every male, both bond and free in Israel, and will burn up the house of Jeroboam, as a man burns up dung until it is all gone. ^1410

Anyone belonging to Jeroboam who dies in the city the dogs shall eat, and anyone who dies in the open country the birds of the heavens shall eat, for the Lord has spoken it. ^1411

Arise therefore, go to your house. When your feet enter the city, the child shall die. ^1412

And all Israel shall mourn for him and bury him, for he only of Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there is found something pleasing to the Lord, the God of Israel, in the house of Jeroboam. ^1413

Moreover, the Lord will raise up for himself a king over Israel who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam today. And henceforth, ^1414

the Lord will strike Israel as a reed is shaken in the water, and root up Israel out of this good land that he gave to their fathers and scatter them beyond the Euphrates, because they have made their Asherim, provoking the Lord to anger. ^1415

And he will give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, which he sinned and made Israel to sin. ^1416

Then Jeroboam’s wife arose and departed and came to Tirzah. And as she came to the threshold of the house, the child died. ^1417

And all Israel buried him and mourned for him, according to the word of the Lord, which he spoke by his servant Ahijah the prophet. ^1418

Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel. ^1419

And the time that Jeroboam reigned was twenty-two years. And he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his place. ^1420

Now Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city that the Lord had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. His mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonite. ^1421

And Judah did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins that they committed, more than all that their fathers had done. ^1422

For they also built for themselves high places and pillars and Asherim on every high hill and under every green tree, ^1423

and there were also male cult prostitutes in the land. They did according to all the abominations of the nations that the Lord drove out before the people of Israel. ^1424

In the fifth year of King Rehoboam, Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem. ^1425

He took away the treasures of the house of the Lord and the treasures of the king’s house. He took away everything. He also took away all the shields of gold that Solomon had made, ^1426

and King Rehoboam made in their place shields of bronze, and committed them to the hands of the officers of the guard, who kept the door of the king’s house. ^1427

And as often as the king went into the house of the Lord, the guard carried them and brought them back to the guardroom. ^1428

Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? ^1429

And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually. ^1430

And Rehoboam slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. His mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonite. And Abijam his son reigned in his place. ^1431



Now in the eighteenth year of King Jeroboam the son of Nebat, Abijam began to reign over Judah. ^1501

He reigned for three years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom. ^1502

And he walked in all the sins that his father did before him, and his heart was not wholly true to the Lord his God, as the heart of David his father. ^1503

Nevertheless, for David’s sake the Lord his God gave him a lamp in Jerusalem, setting up his son after him, and establishing Jerusalem, ^1504

because David did what was right in the eyes of the Lord and did not turn aside from anything that he commanded him all the days of his life, except in the matter of Uriah the Hittite. ^1505

Now there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam all the days of his life. ^1506

The rest of the acts of Abijam and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? And there was war between Abijam and Jeroboam. ^1507

And Abijam slept with his fathers, and they buried him in the city of David. And Asa his son reigned in his place. ^1508

In the twentieth year of Jeroboam king of Israel, Asa began to reign over Judah, ^1509

and he reigned forty-one years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Maacah the daughter of Abishalom. ^1510

And Asa did what was right in the eyes of the Lord, as David his father had done. ^1511

He put away the male cult prostitutes out of the land and removed all the idols that his fathers had made. ^1512

He also removed Maacah his mother from being queen mother because she had made an abominable image for Asherah. And Asa cut down her image and burned it at the brook Kidron. ^1513

But the high places were not taken away. Nevertheless, the heart of Asa was wholly true to the Lord all his days. ^1514

And he brought into the house of the Lord the sacred gifts of his father and his own sacred gifts, silver, and gold, and vessels. ^1515

And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days. ^1516

Baasha king of Israel went up against Judah and built Ramah, that he might permit no one to go out or come in to Asa king of Judah. ^1517

Then Asa took all the silver and the gold that were left in the treasures of the house of the Lord and the treasures of the king’s house and gave them into the hands of his servants. And King Asa sent them to Ben-hadad the son of Tabrimmon, the son of Hezion, king of Syria, who lived in Damascus, saying, ^1518

Let there be a covenant between me and you, as there was between my father and your father. Behold, I am sending to you a present of silver and gold. Go, break your covenant with Baasha king of Israel, that he may withdraw from me. ^1519

And Ben-hadad listened to King Asa and sent the commanders of his armies against the cities of Israel and conquered Ijon, Dan, Abel-beth-maacah, and all Chinneroth, with all the land of Naphtali. ^1520

And when Baasha heard of it, he stopped building Ramah, and he lived in Tirzah. ^1521

Then King Asa made a proclamation to all Judah, none was exempt, and they carried away the stones of Ramah and its timber, with which Baasha had been building, and with them King Asa built Geba of Benjamin and Mizpah. ^1522

Now the rest of all the acts of Asa, all his might, and all that he did, and the cities that he built, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? But in his old age he was diseased in his feet. ^1523

And Asa slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father, and Jehoshaphat his son reigned in his place. ^1524

Nadab the son of Jeroboam began to reign over Israel in the second year of Asa king of Judah, and he reigned over Israel two years. ^1525

He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord and walked in the way of his father, and in his sin which he made Israel to sin. ^1526

Baasha the son of Ahijah, of the house of Issachar, conspired against him. And Baasha struck him down at Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines, for Nadab and all Israel were laying siege to Gibbethon. ^1527

So Baasha killed him in the third year of Asa king of Judah and reigned in his place. ^1528

And as soon as he was king, he killed all the house of Jeroboam. He left to the house of Jeroboam not one that breathed, until he had destroyed it, according to the word of the Lord that he spoke by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite. ^1529

It was for the sins of Jeroboam that he sinned and that he made Israel to sin, and because of the anger to which he provoked the Lord, the God of Israel. ^1530

Now the rest of the acts of Nadab and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? ^1531

And there was war between Asa and Baasha king of Israel all their days. ^1532

In the third year of Asa king of Judah, Baasha the son of Ahijah began to reign over all Israel at Tirzah, and he reigned twenty-four years. ^1533

He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord and walked in the way of Jeroboam and in his sin which he made Israel to sin. ^1534



And the word of the Lord came to Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha, saying, ^1601

Since I exalted you out of the dust and made you leader over my people Israel, and you have walked in the way of Jeroboam and have made my people Israel to sin, provoking me to anger with their sins, ^1602

behold, I will utterly sweep away Baasha and his house, and I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat. ^1603

Anyone belonging to Baasha who dies in the city the dogs shall eat, and anyone of his who dies in the field the birds of the heavens shall eat. ^1604

Now the rest of the acts of Baasha and what he did, and his might, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? ^1605

And Baasha slept with his fathers and was buried at Tirzah, and Elah his son reigned in his place. ^1606

Moreover, the word of the Lord came by the prophet Jehu the son of Hanani against Baasha and his house, both because of all the evil that he did in the sight of the Lord, provoking him to anger with the work of his hands, in being like the house of Jeroboam, and also because he destroyed it. ^1607

In the twenty-sixth year of Asa king of Judah, Elah the son of Baasha began to reign over Israel in Tirzah, and he reigned two years. ^1608

But his servant Zimri, commander of half his chariots, conspired against him. When he was at Tirzah, drinking himself drunk in the house of Arza, who was over the household in Tirzah, ^1609

Zimri came in and struck him down and killed him, in the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, and reigned in his place. ^1610

When he began to reign, as soon as he had seated himself on his throne, he struck down all the house of Baasha. He did not leave him a single male of his relatives or his friends. ^1611

Thus Zimri destroyed all the house of Baasha, according to the word of the Lord, which he spoke against Baasha by Jehu the prophet, ^1612

for all the sins of Baasha and the sins of Elah his son, which they sinned and which they made Israel to sin, provoking the Lord God of Israel to anger with their idols. ^1613

Now the rest of the acts of Elah and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? ^1614

In the twenty-seventh year of Asa king of Judah, Zimri reigned seven days in Tirzah. Now the troops were encamped against Gibbethon, which belonged to the Philistines, ^1615

and the troops who were encamped heard it said, Zimri has conspired, and he has killed the king. Therefore all Israel made Omri, the commander of the army, king over Israel that day in the camp. ^1616

So Omri went up from Gibbethon, and all Israel with him, and they besieged Tirzah. ^1617

And when Zimri saw that the city was taken, he went into the citadel of the king’s house and burned the king’s house over him with fire and died, ^1618

because of his sins that he committed, doing evil in the sight of the Lord, walking in the way of Jeroboam, and for his sin which he committed, making Israel to sin. ^1619

Now the rest of the acts of Zimri, and the conspiracy that he made, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? ^1620

Then the people of Israel were divided into two parts. Half of the people followed Tibni the son of Ginath, to make him king, and half followed Omri. ^1621

But the people who followed Omri overcame the people who followed Tibni the son of Ginath. So Tibni died, and Omri became king. ^1622

In the thirty-first year of Asa king of Judah, Omri began to reign over Israel, and he reigned for twelve years; six years he reigned in Tirzah. ^1623

He bought the hill of Samaria from Shemer for two talents of silver, and he fortified the hill and called the name of the city that he built Samaria, after the name of Shemer, the owner of the hill. ^1624

Omri did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, and did more evil than all who were before him. ^1625

For he walked in all the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and in the sins that he made Israel to sin, provoking the Lord, the God of Israel, to anger by their idols. ^1626

Now the rest of the acts of Omri that he did, and the might that he showed, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? ^1627

And Omri slept with his fathers and was buried in Samaria, and Ahab his son reigned in his place. ^1628

In the thirty-eighth year of Asa king of Judah, Ahab the son of Omri began to reign over Israel, and Ahab the son of Omri reigned over Israel in Samaria twenty-two years. ^1629

And Ahab the son of Omri did evil in the sight of the Lord, more than all who were before him. ^1630

And as if it had been a light thing for him to walk in the sins of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, he took for his wife Jezebel the daughter of Ethbaal king of the Sidonians, and went and served Baal and worshiped him. ^1631

He erected an altar for Baal in the house of Baal, which he built in Samaria. ^1632

And Ahab made an Asherah. Ahab did more to provoke the Lord, the God of Israel, to anger than all the kings of Israel who were before him. ^1633

In his days Hiel of Bethel built Jericho. He laid its foundation at the cost of Abiram his firstborn, and set up its gates at the cost of his youngest son Segub, according to the word of the Lord, which he spoke by Joshua the son of Nun. ^1634



Now Elijah the Tishbite, of Tishbe in Gilead, said to Ahab, As the Lord, the God of Israel, lives, before whom I stand, there shall be neither dew nor rain these years, except by my word. ^1701

And the word of the Lord came to him: ^1702

Depart from here and turn eastward and hide yourself by the brook Cherith, which is east of the Jordan. ^1703

You shall drink from the brook, and I have commanded the ravens to feed you there. ^1704

So he went and did according to the word of the Lord. He went and lived by the brook Cherith that is east of the Jordan. ^1705

And the ravens brought him bread and meat in the morning, and bread and meat in the evening, and he drank from the brook. ^1706

And after a while the brook dried up, because there was no rain in the land. ^1707

Then the word of the Lord came to him, ^1708

Arise, go to Zarephath, which belongs to Sidon, and dwell there. Behold, I have commanded a widow there to feed you. ^1709

So he arose and went to Zarephath. And when he came to the gate of the city, behold, a widow was there gathering sticks. And he called to her and said, Bring me a little water in a vessel, that I may drink. ^1710

And as she was going to bring it, he called to her and said, Bring me a morsel of bread in your hand. ^1711

And she said, As the Lord your God lives, I have nothing baked, only a handful of flour in a jar and a little oil in a jug. And now I am gathering a couple of sticks that I may go in and prepare it for myself and my son, that we may eat it and die. ^1712

And Elijah said to her, Do not fear; go and do as you have said. But first make me a little cake of it and bring it to me, and afterward make something for yourself and your son. ^1713

For thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, The jar of flour shall not be spent, and the jug of oil shall not be empty, until the day that the Lord sends rain upon the earth. ^1714

And she went and did as Elijah said. And she and he and her household ate for many days. ^1715

The jar of flour was not spent, neither did the jug of oil become empty, according to the word of the Lord that he spoke by Elijah. ^1716

After this the son of the woman, the mistress of the house, became ill. And his illness was so severe that there was no breath left in him. ^1717

And she said to Elijah, What have you against me, O man of God? You have come to me to bring my sin to remembrance and to cause the death of my son! ^1718

And he said to her, Give me your son. And he took him from her arms and carried him up into the upper chamber where he lodged, and laid him on his own bed. ^1719

And he cried to the Lord, O Lord my God, have you brought calamity even upon the widow with whom I sojourn, by killing her son? ^1720

Then he stretched himself upon the child three times and cried to the Lord, O Lord my God, let this child’s life come into him again. ^1721

And the Lord listened to the voice of Elijah. And the life of the child came into him again, and he revived. ^1722

And Elijah took the child and brought him down from the upper chamber into the house and delivered him to his mother. And Elijah said, See, your son lives. ^1723

And the woman said to Elijah, Now I know that you are a man of God, and that the word of the Lord in your mouth is truth. ^1724



After many days the word of the Lord came to Elijah, in the third year, saying, Go, show yourself to Ahab, and I will send rain upon the earth. ^1801

So Elijah went to show himself to Ahab. Now the famine was severe in Samaria. ^1802

And Ahab called Obadiah, who was over the household. (Now Obadiah feared the Lord greatly, ^1803

and when Jezebel cut off the prophets of the Lord, Obadiah took a hundred prophets and hid them by fifties in a cave and fed them with bread and water .) ^1804

And Ahab said to Obadiah, Go through the land to all the springs of water and to all the valleys. Perhaps we may find grass and save the horses and mules alive, and not lose some of the animals. ^1805

So they divided the land between them to pass through it. Ahab went in one direction by himself, and Obadiah went in another direction by himself. ^1806

And as Obadiah was on the way, behold, Elijah met him. And Obadiah recognized him and fell on his face and said, Is it you, my lord Elijah? ^1807

And he answered him, It is I. Go, tell your lord, Behold, Elijah is here. ^1808

And he said, How have I sinned, that you would give your servant into the hand of Ahab, to kill me? ^1809

As the Lord your God lives, there is no nation or kingdom where my lord has not sent to seek you. And when they would say, He is not here, he would take an oath of the kingdom or nation, that they had not found you. ^1810

And now you say, Go, tell your lord, Behold, Elijah is here. ^1811

And as soon as I have gone from you, the Spirit of the Lord will carry you I know not where. And so, when I come and tell Ahab and he cannot find you, he will kill me, although I your servant have feared the Lord from my youth. ^1812

Has it not been told my lord what I did when Jezebel killed the prophets of the Lord, how I hid a hundred men of the Lord ’s prophets by fifties in a cave and fed them with bread and water? ^1813

And now you say, Go, tell your lord, Behold, Elijah is here; and he will kill me. ^1814

And Elijah said, As the Lord of hosts lives, before whom I stand, I will surely show myself to him today. ^1815

So Obadiah went to meet Ahab, and told him. And Ahab went to meet Elijah. ^1816

When Ahab saw Elijah, Ahab said to him, Is it you, you troubler of Israel? ^1817

And he answered, I have not troubled Israel, but you have, and your father’s house, because you have abandoned the commandments of the Lord and followed the Baals. ^1818

Now therefore send and gather all Israel to me at Mount Carmel, and the 450 prophets of Baal and the 400 prophets of Asherah, who eat at Jezebel’s table. ^1819

So Ahab sent to all the people of Israel and gathered the prophets together at Mount Carmel. ^1820

And Elijah came near to all the people and said, How long will you go limping between two different opinions? If the Lord is God, follow him; but if Baal, then follow him. And the people did not answer him a word. ^1821

Then Elijah said to the people, I, even I only, am left a prophet of the Lord, but Baal’s prophets are 450 men. ^1822

Let two bulls be given to us, and let them choose one bull for themselves and cut it in pieces and lay it on the wood, but put no fire to it. And I will prepare the other bull and lay it on the wood and put no fire to it. ^1823

And you call upon the name of your god, and I will call upon the name of the Lord, and the God who answers by fire, he is God. And all the people answered, It is well spoken. ^1824

Then Elijah said to the prophets of Baal, Choose for yourselves one bull and prepare it first, for you are many, and call upon the name of your god, but put no fire to it. ^1825

And they took the bull that was given them, and they prepared it and called upon the name of Baal from morning until noon, saying, O Baal, answer us! But there was no voice, and no one answered. And they limped around the altar that they had made. ^1826

And at noon Elijah mocked them, saying, Cry aloud, for he is a god. Either he is musing, or he is relieving himself, or he is on a journey, or perhaps he is asleep and must be awakened. ^1827

And they cried aloud and cut themselves after their custom with swords and lances, until the blood gushed out upon them. ^1828

And as midday passed, they raved on until the time of the offering of the oblation, but there was no voice. No one answered; no one paid attention. ^1829

Then Elijah said to all the people, Come near to me. And all the people came near to him. And he repaired the altar of the Lord that had been thrown down. ^1830

Elijah took twelve stones, according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of the Lord came, saying, Israel shall be your name, ^1831

and with the stones he built an altar in the name of the Lord. And he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two seahs of seed. ^1832

And he put the wood in order and cut the bull in pieces and laid it on the wood. And he said, Fill four jars with water and pour it on the burnt offering and on the wood. ^1833

And he said, Do it a second time. And they did it a second time. And he said, Do it a third time. And they did it a third time. ^1834

And the water ran around the altar and filled the trench also with water. ^1835

And at the time of the offering of the oblation, Elijah the prophet came near and said, O Lord, God of Abraham, Isaac, and Israel, let it be known this day that you are God in Israel, and that I am your servant, and that I have done all these things at your word. ^1836

Answer me, O Lord, answer me, that this people may know that you, O Lord, are God, and that you have turned their hearts back. ^1837

Then the fire of the Lord fell and consumed the burnt offering and the wood and the stones and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench. ^1838

And when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces and said, The Lord, he is God; the Lord, he is God. ^1839

And Elijah said to them, Seize the prophets of Baal; let not one of them escape. And they seized them. And Elijah brought them down to the brook Kishon and slaughtered them there. ^1840

And Elijah said to Ahab, Go up, eat and drink, for there is a sound of the rushing of rain. ^1841

So Ahab went up to eat and to drink. And Elijah went up to the top of Mount Carmel. And he bowed himself down on the earth and put his face between his knees. ^1842

And he said to his servant, Go up now, look toward the sea. And he went up and looked and said, There is nothing. And he said, Go again, seven times. ^1843

And at the seventh time he said, Behold, a little cloud like a man’s hand is rising from the sea. And he said, Go up, say to Ahab, Prepare your chariot and go down, lest the rain stop you. ^1844

And in a little while the heavens grew black with clouds and wind, and there was a great rain. And Ahab rode and went to Jezreel. ^1845

And the hand of the Lord was on Elijah, and he gathered up his garment and ran before Ahab to the entrance of Jezreel. ^1846



Ahab told Jezebel all that Elijah had done, and how he had killed all the prophets with the sword. ^1901

Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah, saying, So may the gods do to me and more also, if I do not make your life as the life of one of them by this time tomorrow. ^1902

Then he was afraid, and he arose and ran for his life and came to Beersheba, which belongs to Judah, and left his servant there. ^1903

But he himself went a day’s journey into the wilderness and came and sat down under a broom tree. And he asked that he might die, saying, It is enough; now, O Lord, take away my life, for I am no better than my fathers. ^1904

And he lay down and slept under a broom tree. And behold, an angel touched him and said to him, Arise and eat. ^1905

And he looked, and behold, there was at his head a cake baked on hot stones and a jar of water. And he ate and drank and lay down again. ^1906

And the angel of the Lord came again a second time and touched him and said, Arise and eat, for the journey is too great for you. ^1907

And he arose and ate and drank, and went in the strength of that food forty days and forty nights to Horeb, the mount of God. ^1908

There he came to a cave and lodged in it. And behold, the word of the Lord came to him, and he said to him, What are you doing here, Elijah? ^1909

He said, I have been very jealous for the Lord, the God of hosts. For the people of Israel have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and killed your prophets with the sword, and I, even I only, am left, and they seek my life, to take it away. ^1910

And he said, Go out and stand on the mount before the Lord. And behold, the Lord passed by, and a great and strong wind tore the mountains and broke in pieces the rocks before the Lord, but the Lord was not in the wind. And after the wind an earthquake, but the Lord was not in the earthquake. ^1911

And after the earthquake a fire, but the Lord was not in the fire. And after the fire the sound of a low whisper. ^1912

And when Elijah heard it, he wrapped his face in his cloak and went out and stood at the entrance of the cave. And behold, there came a voice to him and said, What are you doing here, Elijah? ^1913

He said, I have been very jealous for the Lord, the God of hosts. For the people of Israel have forsaken your covenant, thrown down your altars, and killed your prophets with the sword, and I, even I only, am left, and they seek my life, to take it away. ^1914

And the Lord said to him, Go, return on your way to the wilderness of Damascus. And when you arrive, you shall anoint Hazael to be king over Syria. ^1915

And Jehu the son of Nimshi you shall anoint to be king over Israel, and Elisha the son of Shaphat of Abel-meholah you shall anoint to be prophet in your place. ^1916

And the one who escapes from the sword of Hazael shall Jehu put to death, and the one who escapes from the sword of Jehu shall Elisha put to death. ^1917

Yet I will leave seven thousand in Israel, all the knees that have not bowed to Baal, and every mouth that has not kissed him. ^1918

So he departed from there and found Elisha the son of Shaphat, who was plowing with twelve yoke of oxen in front of him, and he was with the twelfth. Elijah passed by him and cast his cloak upon him. ^1919

And he left the oxen and ran after Elijah and said, Let me kiss my father and my mother, and then I will follow you. And he said to him, Go back again, for what have I done to you? ^1920

And he returned from following him and took the yoke of oxen and sacrificed them and boiled their flesh with the yokes of the oxen and gave it to the people, and they ate. Then he arose and went after Elijah and assisted him. ^1921



Ben-hadad the king of Syria gathered all his army together. Thirty-two kings were with him, and horses and chariots. And he went up and closed in on Samaria and fought against it. ^2001

And he sent messengers into the city to Ahab king of Israel and said to him, Thus says Ben-hadad : ^2002

Your silver and your gold are mine; your best wives and children also are mine. ^2003

And the king of Israel answered, As you say, my lord, O king, I am yours, and all that I have. ^2004

The messengers came again and said, Thus says Ben-hadad : I sent to you, saying, Deliver to me your silver and your gold, your wives and your children. ^2005

Nevertheless I will send my servants to you tomorrow about this time, and they shall search your house and the houses of your servants and lay hands on whatever pleases you and take it away. ^2006

Then the king of Israel called all the elders of the land and said, Mark, now, and see how this man is seeking trouble, for he sent to me for my wives and my children, and for my silver and my gold, and I did not refuse him. ^2007

And all the elders and all the people said to him, Do not listen or consent. ^2008

So he said to the messengers of Ben-hadad, Tell my lord the king, All that you first demanded of your servant I will do, but this thing I cannot do. And the messengers departed and brought him word again. ^2009

Ben-hadad sent to him and said, The gods do so to me and more also, if the dust of Samaria shall suffice for handfuls for all the people who follow me. ^2010

And the king of Israel answered, Tell him, Let not him who straps on his armor boast himself as he who takes it off. ^2011

When Ben-hadad heard this message as he was drinking with the kings in the booths, he said to his men, Take your positions. And they took their positions against the city. ^2012

And behold, a prophet came near to Ahab king of Israel and said, Thus says the Lord, Have you seen all this great multitude? Behold, I will give it into your hand this day, and you shall know that I am the Lord. ^2013

And Ahab said, By whom? He said, Thus says the Lord, By the servants of the governors of the districts. Then he said, Who shall begin the battle? He answered, You. ^2014

Then he mustered the servants of the governors of the districts, and they were 232. And after them he mustered all the people of Israel, seven thousand. ^2015

And they went out at noon, while Ben-hadad was drinking himself drunk in the booths, he and the thirty-two kings who helped him. ^2016

The servants of the governors of the districts went out first. And Ben-hadad sent out scouts, and they reported to him, Men are coming out from Samaria. ^2017

He said, If they have come out for peace, take them alive. Or if they have come out for war, take them alive. ^2018

So these went out of the city, the servants of the governors of the districts and the army that followed them. ^2019

And each struck down his man. The Syrians fled, and Israel pursued them, but Ben-hadad king of Syria escaped on a horse with horsemen. ^2020

And the king of Israel went out and struck the horses and chariots, and struck the Syrians with a great blow. ^2021

Then the prophet came near to the king of Israel and said to him, Come, strengthen yourself, and consider well what you have to do, for in the spring the king of Syria will come up against you. ^2022

And the servants of the king of Syria said to him, Their gods are gods of the hills, and so they were stronger than we. But let us fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they. ^2023

And do this : remove the kings, each from his post, and put commanders in their places, ^2024

and muster an army like the army that you have lost, horse for horse, and chariot for chariot. Then we will fight against them in the plain, and surely we shall be stronger than they. And he listened to their voice and did so. ^2025

In the spring, Ben-hadad mustered the Syrians and went up to Aphek to fight against Israel. ^2026

And the people of Israel were mustered and were provisioned and went against them. The people of Israel encamped before them like two little flocks of goats, but the Syrians filled the country. ^2027

And a man of God came near and said to the king of Israel, Thus says the Lord, Because the Syrians have said, The Lord is a god of the hills but he is not a god of the valleys, therefore I will give all this great multitude into your hand, and you shall know that I am the Lord. ^2028

And they encamped opposite one another seven days. Then on the seventh day the battle was joined. And the people of Israel struck down of the Syrians 100,000 foot soldiers in one day. ^2029

And the rest fled into the city of Aphek, and the wall fell upon 27,000 men who were left. Ben-hadad also fled and entered an inner chamber in the city. ^2030

And his servants said to him, Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the house of Israel are merciful kings. Let us put sackcloth around our waists and ropes on our heads and go out to the king of Israel. Perhaps he will spare your life. ^2031

So they tied sackcloth around their waists and put ropes on their heads and went to the king of Israel and said, Your servant Ben-hadad says, Please, let me live. And he said, Does he still live? He is my brother. ^2032

Now the men were watching for a sign, and they quickly took it up from him and said, Yes, your brother Ben-hadad. Then he said, Go and bring him. Then Ben-hadad came out to him, and he caused him to come up into the chariot. ^2033

And Ben-hadad said to him, The cities that my father took from your father I will restore, and you may establish bazaars for yourself in Damascus, as my father did in Samaria. And Ahab said, I will let you go on these terms. So he made a covenant with him and let him go. ^2034

And a certain man of the sons of the prophets said to his fellow at the command of the Lord, Strike me, please. But the man refused to strike him. ^2035

Then he said to him, Because you have not obeyed the voice of the Lord, behold, as soon as you have gone from me, a lion shall strike you down. And as soon as he had departed from him, a lion met him and struck him down. ^2036

Then he found another man and said, Strike me, please. And the man struck him— struck him and wounded him. ^2037

So the prophet departed and waited for the king by the way, disguising himself with a bandage over his eyes. ^2038

And as the king passed, he cried to the king and said, Your servant went out into the midst of the battle, and behold, a soldier turned and brought a man to me and said, Guard this man; if by any means he is missing, your life shall be for his life, or else you shall pay a talent of silver. ^2039

And as your servant was busy here and there, he was gone. The king of Israel said to him, So shall your judgment be; you yourself have decided it. ^2040

Then he hurried to take the bandage away from his eyes, and the king of Israel recognized him as one of the prophets. ^2041

And he said to him, Thus says the Lord, Because you have let go out of your hand the man whom I had devoted to destruction, therefore your life shall be for his life, and your people for his people. ^2042

And the king of Israel went to his house vexed and sullen and came to Samaria. ^2043



Now Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard in Jezreel, beside the palace of Ahab king of Samaria. ^2101

And after this Ahab said to Naboth, Give me your vineyard, that I may have it for a vegetable garden, because it is near my house, and I will give you a better vineyard for it; or, if it seems good to you, I will give you its value in money. ^2102

But Naboth said to Ahab, The Lord forbid that I should give you the inheritance of my fathers. ^2103

And Ahab went into his house vexed and sullen because of what Naboth the Jezreelite had said to him, for he had said, I will not give you the inheritance of my fathers. And he lay down on his bed and turned away his face and would eat no food. ^2104

But Jezebel his wife came to him and said to him, Why is your spirit so vexed that you eat no food? ^2105

And he said to her, Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite and said to him, Give me your vineyard for money, or else, if it please you, I will give you another vineyard for it. And he answered, I will not give you my vineyard. ^2106

And Jezebel his wife said to him, Do you now govern Israel? Arise and eat bread and let your heart be cheerful; I will give you the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite. ^2107

So she wrote letters in Ahab’s name and sealed them with his seal, and she sent the letters to the elders and the leaders who lived with Naboth in his city. ^2108

And she wrote in the letters, Proclaim a fast, and set Naboth at the head of the people. ^2109

And set two worthless men opposite him, and let them bring a charge against him, saying, You have cursed God and the king. Then take him out and stone him to death. ^2110

And the men of his city, the elders and the leaders who lived in his city, did as Jezebel had sent word to them. As it was written in the letters that she had sent to them, ^2111

they proclaimed a fast and set Naboth at the head of the people. ^2112

And the two worthless men came in and sat opposite him. And the worthless men brought a charge against Naboth in the presence of the people, saying, Naboth cursed God and the king. So they took him outside the city and stoned him to death with stones. ^2113

Then they sent to Jezebel, saying, Naboth has been stoned; he is dead. ^2114

As soon as Jezebel heard that Naboth had been stoned and was dead, Jezebel said to Ahab, Arise, take possession of the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, which he refused to give you for money, for Naboth is not alive, but dead. ^2115

And as soon as Ahab heard that Naboth was dead, Ahab arose to go down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite, to take possession of it. ^2116

Then the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying, ^2117

Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who is in Samaria; behold, he is in the vineyard of Naboth, where he has gone to take possession. ^2118

And you shall say to him, Thus says the Lord, Have you killed and also taken possession? And you shall say to him, Thus says the Lord : In the place where dogs licked up the blood of Naboth shall dogs lick your own blood. ^2119

Ahab said to Elijah, Have you found me, O my enemy? He answered, I have found you, because you have sold yourself to do what is evil in the sight of the Lord. ^2120

Behold, I will bring disaster upon you. I will utterly burn you up, and will cut off from Ahab every male, bond or free, in Israel. ^2121

And I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, and like the house of Baasha the son of Ahijah, for the anger to which you have provoked me, and because you have made Israel to sin. ^2122

And of Jezebel the Lord also said, The dogs shall eat Jezebel within the walls of Jezreel. ^2123

Anyone belonging to Ahab who dies in the city the dogs shall eat, and anyone of his who dies in the open country the birds of the heavens shall eat. ^2124

( There was none who sold himself to do what was evil in the sight of the Lord like Ahab, whom Jezebel his wife incited. ^2125

He acted very abominably in going after idols, as the Amorites had done, whom the Lord cast out before the people of Israel .) ^2126

And when Ahab heard those words, he tore his clothes and put sackcloth on his flesh and fasted and lay in sackcloth and went about dejectedly. ^2127

And the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tishbite, saying, ^2128

Have you seen how Ahab has humbled himself before me? Because he has humbled himself before me, I will not bring the disaster in his days; but in his son’s days I will bring the disaster upon his house. ^2129



For three years Syria and Israel continued without war. ^2201

But in the third year Jehoshaphat the king of Judah came down to the king of Israel. ^2202

And the king of Israel said to his servants, Do you know that Ramoth-gilead belongs to us, and we keep quiet and do not take it out of the hand of the king of Syria? ^2203

And he said to Jehoshaphat, Will you go with me to battle at Ramoth-gilead? And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, I am as you are, my people as your people, my horses as your horses. ^2204

And Jehoshaphat said to the king of Israel, Inquire first for the word of the Lord. ^2205

Then the king of Israel gathered the prophets together, about four hundred men, and said to them, Shall I go to battle against Ramoth-gilead, or shall I refrain? And they said, Go up, for the Lord will give it into the hand of the king. ^2206

But Jehoshaphat said, Is there not here another prophet of the Lord of whom we may inquire? ^2207

And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, There is yet one man by whom we may inquire of the Lord, Micaiah the son of Imlah, but I hate him, for he never prophesies good concerning me, but evil. And Jehoshaphat said, Let not the king say so. ^2208

Then the king of Israel summoned an officer and said, Bring quickly Micaiah the son of Imlah. ^2209

Now the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah were sitting on their thrones, arrayed in their robes, at the threshing floor at the entrance of the gate of Samaria, and all the prophets were prophesying before them. ^2210

And Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah made for himself horns of iron and said, Thus says the Lord, With these you shall push the Syrians until they are destroyed. ^2211

And all the prophets prophesied so and said, Go up to Ramoth-gilead and triumph; the Lord will give it into the hand of the king. ^2212

And the messenger who went to summon Micaiah said to him, Behold, the words of the prophets with one accord are favorable to the king. Let your word be like the word of one of them, and speak favorably. ^2213

But Micaiah said, As the Lord lives, what the Lord says to me, that I will speak. ^2214

And when he had come to the king, the king said to him, Micaiah, shall we go to Ramoth-gilead to battle, or shall we refrain? And he answered him, Go up and triumph; the Lord will give it into the hand of the king. ^2215

But the king said to him, How many times shall I make you swear that you speak to me nothing but the truth in the name of the Lord? ^2216

And he said, I saw all Israel scattered on the mountains, as sheep that have no shepherd. And the Lord said, These have no master; let each return to his home in peace. ^2217

And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, Did I not tell you that he would not prophesy good concerning me, but evil? ^2218

And Micaiah said, Therefore hear the word of the Lord : I saw the Lord sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven standing beside him on his right hand and on his left; ^2219

and the Lord said, Who will entice Ahab, that he may go up and fall at Ramoth-gilead? And one said one thing, and another said another. ^2220

Then a spirit came forward and stood before the Lord, saying, I will entice him. ^2221

And the Lord said to him, By what means? And he said, I will go out, and will be a lying spirit in the mouth of all his prophets. And he said, You are to entice him, and you shall succeed; go out and do so. ^2222

Now therefore behold, the Lord has put a lying spirit in the mouth of all these your prophets; the Lord has declared disaster for you. ^2223

Then Zedekiah the son of Chenaanah came near and struck Micaiah on the cheek and said, How did the Spirit of the Lord go from me to speak to you? ^2224

And Micaiah said, Behold, you shall see on that day when you go into an inner chamber to hide yourself. ^2225

And the king of Israel said, Seize Micaiah, and take him back to Amon the governor of the city and to Joash the king’s son, ^2226

and say, Thus says the king, Put this fellow in prison and feed him meager rations of bread and water, until I come in peace. ^2227

And Micaiah said, If you return in peace, the Lord has not spoken by me. And he said, Hear, all you peoples! ^2228

So the king of Israel and Jehoshaphat the king of Judah went up to Ramoth-gilead. ^2229

And the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat, I will disguise myself and go into battle, but you wear your robes. And the king of Israel disguised himself and went into battle. ^2230

Now the king of Syria had commanded the thirty-two captains of his chariots, Fight with neither small nor great, but only with the king of Israel. ^2231

And when the captains of the chariots saw Jehoshaphat, they said, It is surely the king of Israel. So they turned to fight against him. And Jehoshaphat cried out. ^2232

And when the captains of the chariots saw that it was not the king of Israel, they turned back from pursuing him. ^2233

But a certain man drew his bow at random and struck the king of Israel between the scale armor and the breastplate. Therefore he said to the driver of his chariot, Turn around and carry me out of the battle, for I am wounded. ^2234

And the battle continued that day, and the king was propped up in his chariot facing the Syrians, until at evening he died. And the blood of the wound flowed into the bottom of the chariot. ^2235

And about sunset a cry went through the army, Every man to his city, and every man to his country! ^2236

So the king died, and was brought to Samaria. And they buried the king in Samaria. ^2237

And they washed the chariot by the pool of Samaria, and the dogs licked up his blood, and the prostitutes washed themselves in it, according to the word of the Lord that he had spoken. ^2238

Now the rest of the acts of Ahab and all that he did, and the ivory house that he built and all the cities that he built, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel? ^2239

So Ahab slept with his fathers, and Ahaziah his son reigned in his place. ^2240

Jehoshaphat the son of Asa began to reign over Judah in the fourth year of Ahab king of Israel. ^2241

Jehoshaphat was thirty-five years old when he began to reign, and he reigned twenty-five years in Jerusalem. His mother’s name was Azubah the daughter of Shilhi. ^2242

He walked in all the way of Asa his father. He did not turn aside from it, doing what was right in the sight of the Lord. Yet the high places were not taken away, and the people still sacrificed and made offerings on the high places. ^2243

Jehoshaphat also made peace with the king of Israel. ^2244

Now the rest of the acts of Jehoshaphat, and his might that he showed, and how he warred, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah? ^2245

And from the land he exterminated the remnant of the male cult prostitutes who remained in the days of his father Asa. ^2246

There was no king in Edom; a deputy was king. ^2247

Jehoshaphat made ships of Tarshish to go to Ophir for gold, but they did not go, for the ships were wrecked at Ezion-geber. ^2248

Then Ahaziah the son of Ahab said to Jehoshaphat, Let my servants go with your servants in the ships, but Jehoshaphat was not willing. ^2249

And Jehoshaphat slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David his father, and Jehoram his son reigned in his place. ^2250

Ahaziah the son of Ahab began to reign over Israel in Samaria in the seventeenth year of Jehoshaphat king of Judah, and he reigned two years over Israel. ^2251

He did what was evil in the sight of the Lord and walked in the way of his father and in the way of his mother and in the way of Jeroboam the son of Nebat, who made Israel to sin. ^2252

He served Baal and worshiped him and provoked the Lord, the God of Israel, to anger in every way that his father had done. ^2253
