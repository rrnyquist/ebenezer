There was a man in the land of Uz whose name was Job, and that man was blameless and upright, one who feared God and turned away from evil. ^0101

There were born to him seven sons and three daughters. ^0102

He possessed 7,000 sheep, 3,000 camels, 500 yoke of oxen, and 500 female donkeys, and very many servants, so that this man was the greatest of all the people of the east. ^0103

His sons used to go and hold a feast in the house of each one on his day, and they would send and invite their three sisters to eat and drink with them. ^0104

And when the days of the feast had run their course, Job would send and consecrate them, and he would rise early in the morning and offer burnt offerings according to the number of them all. For Job said, It may be that my children have sinned, and cursed God in their hearts. Thus Job did continually. ^0105

Now there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came among them. ^0106

The LORD said to Satan, From where have you come? Satan answered the LORD and said, From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking up and down on it. ^0107

And the LORD said to Satan, Have you considered my servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, who fears God and turns away from evil? ^0108

Then Satan answered the LORD and said, Does Job fear God for no reason? ^0109

Have you not put a hedge around him and his house and all that he has, on every side? You have blessed the work of his hands, and his possessions have increased in the land. ^0110

But stretch out your hand and touch all that he has, and he will curse you to your face. ^0111

And the LORD said to Satan, Behold, all that he has is in your hand. Only against him do not stretch out your hand. So Satan went out from the presence of the LORD. ^0112

Now there was a day when his sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house, ^0113

and there came a messenger to Job and said, The oxen were plowing and the donkeys feeding beside them, ^0114

and the Sabeans fell upon them and took them and struck down the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you. ^0115

While he was yet speaking, there came another and said, The fire of God fell from heaven and burned up the sheep and the servants and consumed them, and I alone have escaped to tell you. ^0116

While he was yet speaking, there came another and said, The Chaldeans formed three groups and made a raid on the camels and took them and struck down the servants with the edge of the sword, and I alone have escaped to tell you. ^0117

While he was yet speaking, there came another and said, Your sons and daughters were eating and drinking wine in their oldest brother's house, ^0118

and behold, a great wind came across the wilderness and struck the four corners of the house, and it fell upon the young people, and they are dead, and I alone have escaped to tell you. ^0119

Then Job arose and tore his robe and shaved his head and fell on the ground and worshiped. ^0120

And he said, Naked I came from my mother's womb, and naked shall I return. The LORD gave, and the LORD has taken away; blessed be the name of the LORD. ^0121

In all this Job did not sin or charge God with wrong. ^0122


Again there was a day when the sons of God came to present themselves before the LORD, and Satan also came among them to present himself before the LORD. ^0201

And the LORD said to Satan, From where have you come? Satan answered the LORD and said, From going to and fro on the earth, and from walking up and down on it. ^0202

And the LORD said to Satan, Have you considered my servant Job, that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man, who fears God and turns away from evil? He still holds fast his integrity, although you incited me against him to destroy him without reason. ^0203

Then Satan answered the LORD and said, Skin for skin! All that a man has he will give for his life. ^0204

But stretch out your hand and touch his bone and his flesh, and he will curse you to your face. ^0205

And the LORD said to Satan, Behold, he is in your hand; only spare his life. ^0206

So Satan went out from the presence of the LORD and struck Job with loathsome sores from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head. ^0207

And he took a piece of broken pottery with which to scrape himself while he sat in the ashes. ^0208

Then his wife said to him, Do you still hold fast your integrity? Curse God and die. ^0209

But he said to her, You speak as one of the foolish women would speak. Shall we receive good from God, and shall we not receive evil? In all this Job did not sin with his lips. ^0210

Now when Job's three friends heard of all this evil that had come upon him, they came each from his own place, Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite, and Zophar the Naamathite. They made an appointment together to come to show him sympathy and comfort him. ^0211

And when they saw him from a distance, they did not recognize him. And they raised their voices and wept, and they tore their robes and sprinkled dust on their heads toward heaven. ^0212

And they sat with him on the ground seven days and seven nights, and no one spoke a word to him, for they saw that his suffering was very great. ^0213


After this Job opened his mouth and cursed the day of his birth. ^0301

And Job said: ^0302

Let the day perish on which I was born, and the night that said, 'A man is conceived.' ^0303

Let that day be darkness! May God above not seek it, nor light shine upon it. ^0304

Let gloom and deep darkness claim it. Let clouds dwell upon it; let the blackness of the day terrify it. ^0305

That night--let thick darkness seize it! Let it not rejoice among the days of the year; let it not come into the number of the months. ^0306

Behold, let that night be barren; let no joyful cry enter it. ^0307

Let those curse it who curse the day, who are ready to rouse up Leviathan. ^0308

Let the stars of its dawn be dark; let it hope for light, but have none, nor see the eyelids of the morning, ^0309

because it did not shut the doors of my mother's womb, nor hide trouble from my eyes. ^0310

Why did I not die at birth, come out from the womb and expire? ^0311

Why did the knees receive me? Or why the breasts, that I should nurse? ^0312

For then I would have lain down and been quiet; I would have slept; then I would have been at rest, ^0313

with kings and counselors of the earth who rebuilt ruins for themselves, ^0314

or with princes who had gold, who filled their houses with silver. ^0315

Or why was I not as a hidden stillborn child, as infants who never see the light? ^0316

There the wicked cease from troubling, and there the weary are at rest. ^0317

There the prisoners are at ease together; they hear not the voice of the taskmaster. ^0318

The small and the great are there, and the slave is free from his master. ^0319

Why is light given to him who is in misery, and life to the bitter in soul, ^0320

who long for death, but it comes not, and dig for it more than for hidden treasures, ^0321

who rejoice exceedingly and are glad when they find the grave? ^0322

Why is light given to a man whose way is hidden, whom God has hedged in? ^0323

For my sighing comes instead of my bread, and my groanings are poured out like water. ^0324

For the thing that I fear comes upon me, and what I dread befalls me. ^0325

I am not at ease, nor am I quiet; I have no rest, but trouble comes. ^0326


Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said: ^0401

If one ventures a word with you, will you be impatient? Yet who can keep from speaking? ^0402

Behold, you have instructed many, and you have strengthened the weak hands. ^0403

Your words have upheld him who was stumbling, and you have made firm the feeble knees. ^0404

But now it has come to you, and you are impatient; it touches you, and you are dismayed. ^0405

Is not your fear of God your confidence, and the integrity of your ways your hope? ^0406

Remember: who that was innocent ever perished? Or where were the upright cut off? ^0407

As I have seen, those who plow iniquity and sow trouble reap the same. ^0408

By the breath of God they perish, and by the blast of his anger they are consumed. ^0409

The roar of the lion, the voice of the fierce lion, the teeth of the young lions are broken. ^0410

The strong lion perishes for lack of prey, and the cubs of the lioness are scattered. ^0411

Now a word was brought to me stealthily; my ear received the whisper of it. ^0412

Amid thoughts from visions of the night, when deep sleep falls on men, ^0413

dread came upon me, and trembling, which made all my bones shake. ^0414

A spirit glided past my face; the hair of my flesh stood up. ^0415

It stood still, but I could not discern its appearance. A form was before my eyes; there was silence, then I heard a voice: ^0416

'Can mortal man be in the right before God? Can a man be pure before his Maker? ^0417

Even in his servants he puts no trust, and his angels he charges with error; ^0418

how much more those who dwell in houses of clay, whose foundation is in the dust, who are crushed like the moth. ^0419

Between morning and evening they are beaten to pieces; they perish forever without anyone regarding it. ^0420

Is not their tent-cord plucked up within them, do they not die, and that without wisdom?' ^0421


Call now; is there anyone who will answer you? To which of the holy ones will you turn? ^0501

Surely vexation kills the fool, and jealousy slays the simple. ^0502

I have seen the fool taking root, but suddenly I cursed his dwelling. ^0503

His children are far from safety; they are crushed in the gate, and there is no one to deliver them. ^0504

The hungry eat his harvest, and he takes it even out of thorns, and the thirsty pant after his wealth. ^0505

For affliction does not come from the dust, nor does trouble sprout from the ground, ^0506

but man is born to trouble as the sparks fly upward. ^0507

As for me, I would seek God, and to God would I commit my cause, ^0508

who does great things and unsearchable, marvelous things without number: ^0509

he gives rain on the earth and sends waters on the fields; ^0510

he sets on high those who are lowly, and those who mourn are lifted to safety. ^0511

He frustrates the devices of the crafty, so that their hands achieve no success. ^0512

He catches the wise in their own craftiness, and the schemes of the wily are brought to a quick end. ^0513

They meet with darkness in the daytime and grope at noonday as in the night. ^0514

But he saves the needy from the sword of their mouth and from the hand of the mighty. ^0515

So the poor have hope, and injustice shuts her mouth. ^0516

Behold, blessed is the one whom God reproves; therefore despise not the discipline of the Almighty. ^0517

For he wounds, but he binds up; he shatters, but his hands heal. ^0518

He will deliver you from six troubles; in seven no evil shall touch you. ^0519

In famine he will redeem you from death, and in war from the power of the sword. ^0520

You shall be hidden from the lash of the tongue, and shall not fear destruction when it comes. ^0521

At destruction and famine you shall laugh, and shall not fear the beasts of the earth. ^0522

For you shall be in league with the stones of the field, and the beasts of the field shall be at peace with you. ^0523

You shall know that your tent is at peace, and you shall inspect your fold and miss nothing. ^0524

You shall know also that your offspring shall be many, and your descendants as the grass of the earth. ^0525

You shall come to your grave in ripe old age, like a sheaf gathered up in its season. ^0526

Behold, this we have searched out; it is true. Hear, and know it for your good. ^0527


Then Job answered and said: ^0601

Oh that my vexation were weighed, and all my calamity laid in the balances! ^0602

For then it would be heavier than the sand of the sea; therefore my words have been rash. ^0603

For the arrows of the Almighty are in me; my spirit drinks their poison; the terrors of God are arrayed against me. ^0604

Does the wild donkey bray when he has grass, or the ox low over his fodder? ^0605

Can that which is tasteless be eaten without salt, or is there any taste in the juice of the mallow? ^0606

My appetite refuses to touch them; they are as food that is loathsome to me. ^0607

Oh that I might have my request, and that God would fulfill my hope, ^0608

that it would please God to crush me, that he would let loose his hand and cut me off! ^0609

This would be my comfort; I would even exult in pain unsparing, for I have not denied the words of the Holy One. ^0610

What is my strength, that I should wait? And what is my end, that I should be patient? ^0611

Is my strength the strength of stones, or is my flesh bronze? ^0612

Have I any help in me, when resource is driven from me? ^0613

He who withholds kindness from a friend forsakes the fear of the Almighty. ^0614

My brothers are treacherous as a torrent-bed, as torrential streams that pass away, ^0615

which are dark with ice, and where the snow hides itself. ^0616

When they melt, they disappear; when it is hot, they vanish from their place. ^0617

The caravans turn aside from their course; they go up into the waste and perish. ^0618

The caravans of Tema look, the travelers of Sheba hope. ^0619

They are ashamed because they were confident; they come there and are disappointed. ^0620

For you have now become nothing; you see my calamity and are afraid. ^0621

Have I said, 'Make me a gift'? Or, 'From your wealth offer a bribe for me'? ^0622

Or, 'Deliver me from the adversary's hand'? Or, 'Redeem me from the hand of the ruthless'? ^0623

Teach me, and I will be silent; make me understand how I have gone astray. ^0624

How forceful are upright words! But what does reproof from you reprove? ^0625

Do you think that you can reprove words, when the speech of a despairing man is wind? ^0626

You would even cast lots over the fatherless, and bargain over your friend. ^0627

But now, be pleased to look at me, for I will not lie to your face. ^0628

Please turn; let no injustice be done. Turn now; my vindication is at stake. ^0629

Is there any injustice on my tongue? Cannot my palate discern the cause of calamity? ^0630


Has not man a hard service on earth, and are not his days like the days of a hired hand? ^0701

Like a slave who longs for the shadow, and like a hired hand who looks for his wages, ^0702

so I am allotted months of emptiness, and nights of misery are apportioned to me. ^0703

When I lie down I say, 'When shall I arise?' But the night is long, and I am full of tossing till the dawn. ^0704

My flesh is clothed with worms and dirt; my skin hardens, then breaks out afresh. ^0705

My days are swifter than a weaver's shuttle and come to their end without hope. ^0706

Remember that my life is a breath; my eye will never again see good. ^0707

The eye of him who sees me will behold me no more; while your eyes are on me, I shall be gone. ^0708

As the cloud fades and vanishes, so he who goes down to Sheol does not come up; ^0709

he returns no more to his house, nor does his place know him anymore. ^0710

Therefore I will not restrain my mouth; I will speak in the anguish of my spirit; I will complain in the bitterness of my soul. ^0711

Am I the sea, or a sea monster, that you set a guard over me? ^0712

When I say, 'My bed will comfort me, my couch will ease my complaint,' ^0713

then you scare me with dreams and terrify me with visions, ^0714

so that I would choose strangling and death rather than my bones. ^0715

I loathe my life; I would not live forever. Leave me alone, for my days are a breath. ^0716

What is man, that you make so much of him, and that you set your heart on him, ^0717

visit him every morning and test him every moment? ^0718

How long will you not look away from me, nor leave me alone till I swallow my spit? ^0719

If I sin, what do I do to you, you watcher of mankind? Why have you made me your mark? Why have I become a burden to you? ^0720

Why do you not pardon my transgression and take away my iniquity? For now I shall lie in the earth; you will seek me, but I shall not be. ^0721


Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said: ^0801

How long will you say these things, and the words of your mouth be a great wind? ^0802

Does God pervert justice? Or does the Almighty pervert the right? ^0803

If your children have sinned against him, he has delivered them into the hand of their transgression. ^0804

If you will seek God and plead with the Almighty for mercy, ^0805

if you are pure and upright, surely then he will rouse himself for you and restore your rightful habitation. ^0806

And though your beginning was small, your latter days will be very great. ^0807

For inquire, please, of bygone ages, and consider what the fathers have searched out. ^0808

For we are but of yesterday and know nothing, for our days on earth are a shadow. ^0809

Will they not teach you and tell you and utter words out of their understanding? ^0810

Can papyrus grow where there is no marsh? Can reeds flourish where there is no water? ^0811

While yet in flower and not cut down, they wither before any other plant. ^0812

Such are the paths of all who forget God; the hope of the godless shall perish. ^0813

His confidence is severed, and his trust is a spider's web. ^0814

He leans against his house, but it does not stand; he lays hold of it, but it does not endure. ^0815

He is a lush plant before the sun, and his shoots spread over his garden. ^0816

His roots entwine the stone heap; he looks upon a house of stones. ^0817

If he is destroyed from his place, then it will deny him, saying, 'I have never seen you.' ^0818

Behold, this is the joy of his way, and out of the soil others will spring. ^0819

Behold, God will not reject a blameless man, nor take the hand of evildoers. ^0820

He will yet fill your mouth with laughter, and your lips with shouting. ^0821

Those who hate you will be clothed with shame, and the tent of the wicked will be no more. ^0822


Then Job answered and said: ^0901

Truly I know that it is so: But how can a man be in the right before God? ^0902

If one wished to contend with him, one could not answer him once in a thousand times. ^0903

He is wise in heart and mighty in strength--who has hardened himself against him, and succeeded?-- ^0904

he who removes mountains, and they know it not, when he overturns them in his anger, ^0905

who shakes the earth out of its place, and its pillars tremble; ^0906

who commands the sun, and it does not rise; who seals up the stars; ^0907

who alone stretched out the heavens and trampled the waves of the sea; ^0908

who made the Bear and Orion, the Pleiades and the chambers of the south; ^0909

who does great things beyond searching out, and marvelous things beyond number. ^0910

Behold, he passes by me, and I see him not; he moves on, but I do not perceive him. ^0911

Behold, he snatches away; who can turn him back? Who will say to him, 'What are you doing?' ^0912

God will not turn back his anger; beneath him bowed the helpers of Rahab. ^0913

How then can I answer him, choosing my words with him? ^0914

Though I am in the right, I cannot answer him; I must appeal for mercy to my accuser. ^0915

If I summoned him and he answered me, I would not believe that he was listening to my voice. ^0916

For he crushes me with a tempest and multiplies my wounds without cause; ^0917

he will not let me get my breath, but fills me with bitterness. ^0918

If it is a contest of strength, behold, he is mighty! If it is a matter of justice, who can summon him? ^0919

Though I am in the right, my own mouth would condemn me; though I am blameless, he would prove me perverse. ^0920

I am blameless; I regard not myself; I loathe my life. ^0921

It is all one; therefore I say, He destroys both the blameless and the wicked. ^0922

When disaster brings sudden death, he mocks at the calamity of the innocent. ^0923

The earth is given into the hand of the wicked; he covers the faces of its judges--if it is not he, who then is it? ^0924

My days are swifter than a runner; they flee away; they see no good. ^0925

They go by like skiffs of reed, like an eagle swooping on the prey. ^0926

If I say, 'I will forget my complaint, I will put off my sad face, and be of good cheer,' ^0927

I become afraid of all my suffering, for I know you will not hold me innocent. ^0928

I shall be condemned; why then do I labor in vain? ^0929

If I wash myself with snow and cleanse my hands with lye, ^0930

yet you will plunge me into a pit, and my own clothes will abhor me. ^0931

For he is not a man, as I am, that I might answer him, that we should come to trial together. ^0932

There is no arbiter between us, who might lay his hand on us both. ^0933

Let him take his rod away from me, and let not dread of him terrify me. ^0934

Then I would speak without fear of him, for I am not so in myself. ^0935


I loathe my life; I will give free utterance to my complaint; I will speak in the bitterness of my soul. ^1001

I will say to God, Do not condemn me; let me know why you contend against me. ^1002

Does it seem good to you to oppress, to despise the work of your hands and favor the designs of the wicked? ^1003

Have you eyes of flesh? Do you see as man sees? ^1004

Are your days as the days of man, or your years as a man's years, ^1005

that you seek out my iniquity and search for my sin, ^1006

although you know that I am not guilty, and there is none to deliver out of your hand? ^1007

Your hands fashioned and made me, and now you have destroyed me altogether. ^1008

Remember that you have made me like clay; and will you return me to the dust? ^1009

Did you not pour me out like milk and curdle me like cheese? ^1010

You clothed me with skin and flesh, and knit me together with bones and sinews. ^1011

You have granted me life and steadfast love, and your care has preserved my spirit. ^1012

Yet these things you hid in your heart; I know that this was your purpose. ^1013

If I sin, you watch me and do not acquit me of my iniquity. ^1014

If I am guilty, woe to me! If I am in the right, I cannot lift up my head, for I am filled with disgrace and look on my affliction. ^1015

And were my head lifted up, you would hunt me like a lion and again work wonders against me. ^1016

You renew your witnesses against me and increase your vexation toward me; you bring fresh troops against me. ^1017

Why did you bring me out from the womb? Would that I had died before any eye had seen me ^1018

and were as though I had not been, carried from the womb to the grave. ^1019

Are not my days few? Then cease, and leave me alone, that I may find a little cheer ^1020

before I go--and I shall not return--to the land of darkness and deep shadow, ^1021

the land of gloom like thick darkness, like deep shadow without any order, where light is as thick darkness. ^1022


Then Zophar the Naamathite answered and said: ^1101

Should a multitude of words go unanswered, and a man full of talk be judged right? ^1102

Should your babble silence men, and when you mock, shall no one shame you? ^1103

For you say, 'My doctrine is pure, and I am clean in God's eyes.' ^1104

But oh, that God would speak and open his lips to you, ^1105

and that he would tell you the secrets of wisdom! For he is manifold in understanding. Know then that God exacts of you less than your guilt deserves. ^1106

Can you find out the deep things of God? Can you find out the limit of the Almighty? ^1107

It is higher than heaven--what can you do? Deeper than Sheol--what can you know? ^1108

Its measure is longer than the earth and broader than the sea. ^1109

If he passes through and imprisons and summons the court, who can turn him back? ^1110

For he knows worthless men; when he sees iniquity, will he not consider it? ^1111

But a stupid man will get understanding when a wild donkey's colt is born a man! ^1112

If you prepare your heart, you will stretch out your hands toward him. ^1113

If iniquity is in your hand, put it far away, and let not injustice dwell in your tents. ^1114

Surely then you will lift up your face without blemish; you will be secure and will not fear. ^1115

You will forget your misery; you will remember it as waters that have passed away. ^1116

And your life will be brighter than the noonday; its darkness will be like the morning. ^1117

And you will feel secure, because there is hope; you will look around and take your rest in security. ^1118

You will lie down, and none will make you afraid; many will court your favor. ^1119

But the eyes of the wicked will fail; all way of escape will be lost to them, and their hope is to breathe their last. ^1120


Then Job answered and said: ^1201

No doubt you are the people, and wisdom will die with you. ^1202

But I have understanding as well as you; I am not inferior to you. Who does not know such things as these? ^1203

I am a laughingstock to my friends; I, who called to God and he answered me, a just and blameless man, am a laughingstock. ^1204

In the thought of one who is at ease there is contempt for misfortune; it is ready for those whose feet slip. ^1205

The tents of robbers are at peace, and those who provoke God are secure, who bring their god in their hand. ^1206

But ask the beasts, and they will teach you; the birds of the heavens, and they will tell you; ^1207

or the bushes of the earth, and they will teach you; and the fish of the sea will declare to you. ^1208

Who among all these does not know that the hand of the LORD has done this? ^1209

In his hand is the life of every living thing and the breath of all mankind. ^1210

Does not the ear test words as the palate tastes food? ^1211

Wisdom is with the aged, and understanding in length of days. ^1212

With God are wisdom and might; he has counsel and understanding. ^1213

If he tears down, none can rebuild; if he shuts a man in, none can open. ^1214

If he withholds the waters, they dry up; if he sends them out, they overwhelm the land. ^1215

With him are strength and sound wisdom; the deceived and the deceiver are his. ^1216

He leads counselors away stripped, and judges he makes fools. ^1217

He looses the bonds of kings and binds a waistcloth on their hips. ^1218

He leads priests away stripped and overthrows the mighty. ^1219

He deprives of speech those who are trusted and takes away the discernment of the elders. ^1220

He pours contempt on princes and loosens the belt of the strong. ^1221

He uncovers the deeps out of darkness and brings deep darkness to light. ^1222

He makes nations great, and he destroys them; he enlarges nations, and leads them away. ^1223

He takes away understanding from the chiefs of the people of the earth and makes them wander in a pathless waste. ^1224

They grope in the dark without light, and he makes them stagger like a drunken man. ^1225


Behold, my eye has seen all this, my ear has heard and understood it. ^1301

What you know, I also know; I am not inferior to you. ^1302

But I would speak to the Almighty, and I desire to argue my case with God. ^1303

As for you, you whitewash with lies; worthless physicians are you all. ^1304

Oh that you would keep silent, and it would be your wisdom! ^1305

Hear now my argument and listen to the pleadings of my lips. ^1306

Will you speak falsely for God and speak deceitfully for him? ^1307

Will you show partiality toward him? Will you plead the case for God? ^1308

Will it be well with you when he searches you out? Or can you deceive him, as one deceives a man? ^1309

He will surely rebuke you if in secret you show partiality. ^1310

Will not his majesty terrify you, and the dread of him fall upon you? ^1311

Your maxims are proverbs of ashes; your defenses are defenses of clay. ^1312

Let me have silence, and I will speak, and let come on me what may. ^1313

Why should I take my flesh in my teeth and put my life in my hand? ^1314

Though he slay me, I will hope in him; yet I will argue my ways to his face. ^1315

This will be my salvation, that the godless shall not come before him. ^1316

Keep listening to my words, and let my declaration be in your ears. ^1317

Behold, I have prepared my case; I know that I shall be in the right. ^1318

Who is there who will contend with me? For then I would be silent and die. ^1319

Only grant me two things, then I will not hide myself from your face: ^1320

withdraw your hand far from me, and let not dread of you terrify me. ^1321

Then call, and I will answer; or let me speak, and you reply to me. ^1322

How many are my iniquities and my sins? Make me know my transgression and my sin. ^1323

Why do you hide your face and count me as your enemy? ^1324

Will you frighten a driven leaf and pursue dry chaff? ^1325

For you write bitter things against me and make me inherit the iniquities of my youth. ^1326

You put my feet in the stocks and watch all my paths; you set a limit for the soles of my feet. ^1327

Man wastes away like a rotten thing, like a garment that is moth-eaten. ^1328


Man who is born of a woman is few of days and full of trouble. ^1401

He comes out like a flower and withers; he flees like a shadow and continues not. ^1402

And do you open your eyes on such a one and bring me into judgment with you? ^1403

Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? There is not one. ^1404

Since his days are determined, and the number of his months is with you, and you have appointed his limits that he cannot pass, ^1405

look away from him and leave him alone, that he may enjoy, like a hired hand, his day. ^1406

For there is hope for a tree, if it be cut down, that it will sprout again, and that its shoots will not cease. ^1407

Though its root grow old in the earth, and its stump die in the soil, ^1408

yet at the scent of water it will bud and put out branches like a young plant. ^1409

But a man dies and is laid low; man breathes his last, and where is he? ^1410

As waters fail from a lake and a river wastes away and dries up, ^1411

so a man lies down and rises not again; till the heavens are no more he will not awake or be roused out of his sleep. ^1412

Oh that you would hide me in Sheol, that you would conceal me until your wrath be past, that you would appoint me a set time, and remember me! ^1413

If a man dies, shall he live again? All the days of my service I would wait, till my renewal should come. ^1414

You would call, and I would answer you; you would long for the work of your hands. ^1415

For then you would number my steps; you would not keep watch over my sin; ^1416

my transgression would be sealed up in a bag, and you would cover over my iniquity. ^1417

But the mountain falls and crumbles away, and the rock is removed from its place; ^1418

the waters wear away the stones; the torrents wash away the soil of the earth; so you destroy the hope of man. ^1419

You prevail forever against him, and he passes; you change his countenance, and send him away. ^1420

His sons come to honor, and he does not know it; they are brought low, and he perceives it not. ^1421

He feels only the pain of his own body, and he mourns only for himself. ^1422


Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said: ^1501

Should a wise man answer with windy knowledge, and fill his belly with the east wind? ^1502

Should he argue in unprofitable talk, or in words with which he can do no good? ^1503

But you are doing away with the fear of God and hindering meditation before God. ^1504

For your iniquity teaches your mouth, and you choose the tongue of the crafty. ^1505

Your own mouth condemns you, and not I; your own lips testify against you. ^1506

Are you the first man who was born? Or were you brought forth before the hills? ^1507

Have you listened in the council of God? And do you limit wisdom to yourself? ^1508

What do you know that we do not know? What do you understand that is not clear to us? ^1509

Both the gray-haired and the aged are among us, older than your father. ^1510

Are the comforts of God too small for you, or the word that deals gently with you? ^1511

Why does your heart carry you away, and why do your eyes flash, ^1512

that you turn your spirit against God and bring such words out of your mouth? ^1513

What is man, that he can be pure? Or he who is born of a woman, that he can be righteous? ^1514

Behold, God puts no trust in his holy ones, and the heavens are not pure in his sight; ^1515

how much less one who is abominable and corrupt, a man who drinks injustice like water! ^1516

I will show you; hear me, and what I have seen I will declare ^1517

(what wise men have told, without hiding it from their fathers, ^1518

to whom alone the land was given, and no stranger passed among them). ^1519

The wicked man writhes in pain all his days, through all the years that are laid up for the ruthless. ^1520

Dreadful sounds are in his ears; in prosperity the destroyer will come upon him. ^1521

He does not believe that he will return out of darkness, and he is marked for the sword. ^1522

He wanders abroad for bread, saying, 'Where is it?' He knows that a day of darkness is ready at his hand; ^1523

distress and anguish terrify him; they prevail against him, like a king ready for battle. ^1524

Because he has stretched out his hand against God and defies the Almighty, ^1525

running stubbornly against him with a thickly bossed shield; ^1526

because he has covered his face with his fat and gathered fat upon his waist ^1527

and has lived in desolate cities, in houses that none should inhabit, which were ready to become heaps of ruins; ^1528

he will not be rich, and his wealth will not endure, nor will his possessions spread over the earth; ^1529

he will not depart from darkness; the flame will dry up his shoots, and by the breath of his mouth he will depart. ^1530

Let him not trust in emptiness, deceiving himself, for emptiness will be his payment. ^1531

It will be paid in full before his time, and his branch will not be green. ^1532

He will shake off his unripe grape like the vine, and cast off his blossom like the olive tree. ^1533

For the company of the godless is barren, and fire consumes the tents of bribery. ^1534

They conceive trouble and give birth to evil, and their womb prepares deceit. ^1535


Then Job answered and said: ^1601

I have heard many such things; miserable comforters are you all. ^1602

Shall windy words have an end? Or what provokes you that you answer? ^1603

I also could speak as you do, if you were in my place; I could join words together against you and shake my head at you. ^1604

I could strengthen you with my mouth, and the solace of my lips would assuage your pain. ^1605

If I speak, my pain is not assuaged, and if I forbear, how much of it leaves me? ^1606

Surely now God has worn me out; he has made desolate all my company. ^1607

And he has shriveled me up, which is a witness against me, and my leanness has risen up against me; it testifies to my face. ^1608

He has torn me in his wrath and hated me; he has gnashed his teeth at me; my adversary sharpens his eyes against me. ^1609

Men have gaped at me with their mouth; they have struck me insolently on the cheek; they mass themselves together against me. ^1610

God gives me up to the ungodly and casts me into the hands of the wicked. ^1611

I was at ease, and he broke me apart; he seized me by the neck and dashed me to pieces; he set me up as his target; ^1612

his archers surround me. He slashes open my kidneys and does not spare; he pours out my gall on the ground. ^1613

He breaks me with breach upon breach; he runs upon me like a warrior. ^1614

I have sewed sackcloth upon my skin and have laid my strength in the dust. ^1615

My face is red with weeping, and on my eyelids is deep darkness, ^1616

although there is no violence in my hands, and my prayer is pure. ^1617

O earth, cover not my blood, and let my cry find no resting place. ^1618

Even now, behold, my witness is in heaven, and he who testifies for me is on high. ^1619

My friends scorn me; my eye pours out tears to God, ^1620

that he would argue the case of a man with God, as a son of man does with his neighbor. ^1621

For when a few years have come I shall go the way from which I shall not return. ^1622


My spirit is broken; my days are extinct; the graveyard is ready for me. ^1701

Surely there are mockers about me, and my eye dwells on their provocation. ^1702

Lay down a pledge for me with yourself; who is there who will put up security for me? ^1703

Since you have closed their hearts to understanding, therefore you will not let them triumph. ^1704

He who informs against his friends to get a share of their property--the eyes of his children will fail. ^1705

He has made me a byword of the peoples, and I am one before whom men spit. ^1706

My eye has grown dim from vexation, and all my members are like a shadow. ^1707

The upright are appalled at this, and the innocent stirs himself up against the godless. ^1708

Yet the righteous holds to his way, and he who has clean hands grows stronger and stronger. ^1709

But you, come on again, all of you, and I shall not find a wise man among you. ^1710

My days are past; my plans are broken off, the desires of my heart. ^1711

They make night into day; 'The light,' they say, 'is near to the darkness.' ^1712

If I hope for Sheol as my house, if I make my bed in darkness, ^1713

if I say to the pit, 'You are my father,' and to the worm, 'My mother,' or 'My sister,' ^1714

where then is my hope? Who will see my hope? ^1715

Will it go down to the bars of Sheol? Shall we descend together into the dust? ^1716


Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said: ^1801

How long will you hunt for words? Consider, and then we will speak. ^1802

Why are we counted as cattle? Why are we stupid in your sight? ^1803

You who tear yourself in your anger, shall the earth be forsaken for you, or the rock be removed out of its place? ^1804

Indeed, the light of the wicked is put out, and the flame of his fire does not shine. ^1805

The light is dark in his tent, and his lamp above him is put out. ^1806

His strong steps are shortened, and his own schemes throw him down. ^1807

For he is cast into a net by his own feet, and he walks on its mesh. ^1808

A trap seizes him by the heel; a snare lays hold of him. ^1809

A rope is hidden for him in the ground, a trap for him in the path. ^1810

Terrors frighten him on every side, and chase him at his heels. ^1811

His strength is famished, and calamity is ready for his stumbling. ^1812

It consumes the parts of his skin; the firstborn of death consumes his limbs. ^1813

He is torn from the tent in which he trusted and is brought to the king of terrors. ^1814

In his tent dwells that which is none of his; sulfur is scattered over his habitation. ^1815

His roots dry up beneath, and his branches wither above. ^1816

His memory perishes from the earth, and he has no name in the street. ^1817

He is thrust from light into darkness, and driven out of the world. ^1818

He has no posterity or progeny among his people, and no survivor where he used to live. ^1819

They of the west are appalled at his day, and horror seizes them of the east. ^1820

Surely such are the dwellings of the unrighteous, such is the place of him who knows not God. ^1821


Then Job answered and said: ^1901

How long will you torment me and break me in pieces with words? ^1902

These ten times you have cast reproach upon me; are you not ashamed to wrong me? ^1903

And even if it be true that I have erred, my error remains with myself. ^1904

If indeed you magnify yourselves against me and make my disgrace an argument against me, ^1905

know then that God has put me in the wrong and closed his net about me. ^1906

Behold, I cry out, 'Violence!' but I am not answered; I call for help, but there is no justice. ^1907

He has walled up my way, so that I cannot pass, and he has set darkness upon my paths. ^1908

He has stripped from me my glory and taken the crown from my head. ^1909

He breaks me down on every side, and I am gone, and my hope has he pulled up like a tree. ^1910

He has kindled his wrath against me and counts me as his adversary. ^1911

His troops come on together; they have cast up their siege ramp against me and encamp around my tent. ^1912

He has put my brothers far from me, and those who knew me are wholly estranged from me. ^1913

My relatives have failed me, my close friends have forgotten me. ^1914

The guests in my house and my maidservants count me as a stranger; I have become a foreigner in their eyes. ^1915

I call to my servant, but he gives me no answer; I must plead with him with my mouth for mercy. ^1916

My breath is strange to my wife, and I am a stench to the children of my own mother. ^1917

Even young children despise me; when I rise they talk against me. ^1918

All my intimate friends abhor me, and those whom I loved have turned against me. ^1919

My bones stick to my skin and to my flesh, and I have escaped by the skin of my teeth. ^1920

Have mercy on me, have mercy on me, O you my friends, for the hand of God has touched me! ^1921

Why do you, like God, pursue me? Why are you not satisfied with my flesh? ^1922

Oh that my words were written! Oh that they were inscribed in a book! ^1923

Oh that with an iron pen and lead they were engraved in the rock forever! ^1924

For I know that my Redeemer lives, and at the last he will stand upon the earth. ^1925

And after my skin has been thus destroyed, yet in my flesh I shall see God, ^1926

whom I shall see for myself, and my eyes shall behold, and not another. My heart faints within me! ^1927

If you say, 'How we will pursue him!' and, 'The root of the matter is found in him,' ^1928

be afraid of the sword, for wrath brings the punishment of the sword, that you may know there is a judgment. ^1929


Then Zophar the Naamathite answered and said: ^2001

Therefore my thoughts answer me, because of my haste within me. ^2002

I hear censure that insults me, and out of my understanding a spirit answers me. ^2003

Do you not know this from of old, since man was placed on earth, ^2004

that the exulting of the wicked is short, and the joy of the godless but for a moment? ^2005

Though his height mount up to the heavens, and his head reach to the clouds, ^2006

he will perish forever like his own dung; those who have seen him will say, 'Where is he?' ^2007

He will fly away like a dream and not be found; he will be chased away like a vision of the night. ^2008

The eye that saw him will see him no more, nor will his place any more behold him. ^2009

His children will seek the favor of the poor, and his hands will give back his wealth. ^2010

His bones are full of his youthful vigor, but it will lie down with him in the dust. ^2011

Though evil is sweet in his mouth, though he hides it under his tongue, ^2012

though he is loath to let it go and holds it in his mouth, ^2013

yet his food is turned in his stomach; it is the venom of cobras within him. ^2014

He swallows down riches and vomits them up again; God casts them out of his belly. ^2015

He will suck the poison of cobras; the tongue of a viper will kill him. ^2016

He will not look upon the rivers, the streams flowing with honey and curds. ^2017

He will give back the fruit of his toil and will not swallow it down; from the profit of his trading he will get no enjoyment. ^2018

For he has crushed and abandoned the poor; he has seized a house that he did not build. ^2019

Because he knew no contentment in his belly, he will not let anything in which he delights escape him. ^2020

There was nothing left after he had eaten; therefore his prosperity will not endure. ^2021

In the fullness of his sufficiency he will be in distress; the hand of everyone in misery will come against him. ^2022

To fill his belly to the full God will send his burning anger against him and rain it upon him into his body. ^2023

He will flee from an iron weapon; a bronze arrow will strike him through. ^2024

It is drawn forth and comes out of his body; the glittering point comes out of his gallbladder; terrors come upon him. ^2025

Utter darkness is laid up for his treasures; a fire not fanned will devour him; what is left in his tent will be consumed. ^2026

The heavens will reveal his iniquity, and the earth will rise up against him. ^2027

The possessions of his house will be carried away, dragged off in the day of God's wrath. ^2028

This is the wicked man's portion from God, the heritage decreed for him by God. ^2029


Then Job answered and said: ^2101

Keep listening to my words, and let this be your comfort. ^2102

Bear with me, and I will speak, and after I have spoken, mock on. ^2103

As for me, is my complaint against man? Why should I not be impatient? ^2104

Look at me and be appalled, and lay your hand over your mouth. ^2105

When I remember I am dismayed, and shuddering seizes my flesh. ^2106

Why do the wicked live, reach old age, and grow mighty in power? ^2107

Their offspring are established in their presence, and their descendants before their eyes. ^2108

Their houses are safe from fear, and no rod of God is upon them. ^2109

Their bull breeds without fail; their cow calves and does not miscarry. ^2110

They send out their little boys like a flock, and their children dance. ^2111

They sing to the tambourine and the lyre and rejoice to the sound of the pipe. ^2112

They spend their days in prosperity, and in peace they go down to Sheol. ^2113

They say to God, 'Depart from us! We do not desire the knowledge of your ways. ^2114

What is the Almighty, that we should serve him? And what profit do we get if we pray to him?' ^2115

Behold, is not their prosperity in their hand? The counsel of the wicked is far from me. ^2116

How often is it that the lamp of the wicked is put out? That their calamity comes upon them? That God distributes pains in his anger? ^2117

That they are like straw before the wind, and like chaff that the storm carries away? ^2118

You say, 'God stores up their iniquity for their children.' Let him pay it out to them, that they may know it. ^2119

Let their own eyes see their destruction, and let them drink of the wrath of the Almighty. ^2120

For what do they care for their houses after them, when the number of their months is cut off? ^2121

Will any teach God knowledge, seeing that he judges those who are on high? ^2122

One dies in his full vigor, being wholly at ease and secure, ^2123

his pails full of milk and the marrow of his bones moist. ^2124

Another dies in bitterness of soul, never having tasted of prosperity. ^2125

They lie down alike in the dust, and the worms cover them. ^2126

Behold, I know your thoughts and your schemes to wrong me. ^2127

For you say, 'Where is the house of the prince? Where is the tent in which the wicked lived?' ^2128

Have you not asked those who travel the roads, and do you not accept their testimony ^2129

that the evil man is spared in the day of calamity, that he is rescued in the day of wrath? ^2130

Who declares his way to his face, and who repays him for what he has done? ^2131

When he is carried to the grave, watch is kept over his tomb. ^2132

The clods of the valley are sweet to him; all mankind follows after him, and those who go before him are innumerable. ^2133

How then will you comfort me with empty nothings? There is nothing left of your answers but falsehood. ^2134


Then Eliphaz the Temanite answered and said: ^2201

Can a man be profitable to God? Surely he who is wise is profitable to himself. ^2202

Is it any pleasure to the Almighty if you are in the right, or is it gain to him if you make your ways blameless? ^2203

Is it for your fear of him that he reproves you and enters into judgment with you? ^2204

Is not your evil abundant? There is no end to your iniquities. ^2205

For you have exacted pledges of your brothers for nothing and stripped the naked of their clothing. ^2206

You have given no water to the weary to drink, and you have withheld bread from the hungry. ^2207

The man with power possessed the land, and the favored man lived in it. ^2208

You have sent widows away empty, and the arms of the fatherless were crushed. ^2209

Therefore snares are all around you, and sudden terror overwhelms you, ^2210

or darkness, so that you cannot see, and a flood of water covers you. ^2211

Is not God high in the heavens? See the highest stars, how lofty they are! ^2212

But you say, 'What does God know? Can he judge through the deep darkness? ^2213

Thick clouds veil him, so that he does not see, and he walks on the vault of heaven.' ^2214

Will you keep to the old way that wicked men have trod? ^2215

They were snatched away before their time; their foundation was washed away. ^2216

They said to God, 'Depart from us,' and 'What can the Almighty do to us?' ^2217

Yet he filled their houses with good things--but the counsel of the wicked is far from me. ^2218

The righteous see it and are glad; the innocent one mocks at them, ^2219

saying, 'Surely our adversaries are cut off, and what they left the fire has consumed.' ^2220

Agree with God, and be at peace; thereby good will come to you. ^2221

Receive instruction from his mouth, and lay up his words in your heart. ^2222

If you return to the Almighty you will be built up; if you remove injustice far from your tents, ^2223

if you lay gold in the dust, and gold of Ophir among the stones of the torrent bed, ^2224

then the Almighty will be your gold and your precious silver. ^2225

For then you will delight yourself in the Almighty and lift up your face to God. ^2226

You will make your prayer to him, and he will hear you, and you will pay your vows. ^2227

You will decide on a matter, and it will be established for you, and light will shine on your ways. ^2228

For when they are humbled you say, 'It is because of pride'; but he saves the lowly. ^2229

He delivers even the one who is not innocent, who will be delivered through the cleanness of your hands. ^2230


Then Job answered and said: ^2301

Today also my complaint is bitter; my hand is heavy on account of my groaning. ^2302

Oh, that I knew where I might find him, that I might come even to his seat! ^2303

I would lay my case before him and fill my mouth with arguments. ^2304

I would know what he would answer me and understand what he would say to me. ^2305

Would he contend with me in the greatness of his power? No; he would pay attention to me. ^2306

There an upright man could argue with him, and I would be acquitted forever by my judge. ^2307

Behold, I go forward, but he is not there, and backward, but I do not perceive him; ^2308

on the left hand when he is working, I do not behold him; he turns to the right hand, but I do not see him. ^2309

But he knows the way that I take; when he has tried me, I shall come out as gold. ^2310

My foot has held fast to his steps; I have kept his way and have not turned aside. ^2311

I have not departed from the commandment of his lips; I have treasured the words of his mouth more than my portion of food. ^2312

But he is unchangeable, and who can turn him back? What he desires, that he does. ^2313

For he will complete what he appoints for me, and many such things are in his mind. ^2314

Therefore I am terrified at his presence; when I consider, I am in dread of him. ^2315

God has made my heart faint; the Almighty has terrified me; ^2316

yet I am not silenced because of the darkness, nor because thick darkness covers my face. ^2317


Why are not times of judgment kept by the Almighty, and why do those who know him never see his days? ^2401

Some move landmarks; they seize flocks and pasture them. ^2402

They drive away the donkey of the fatherless; they take the widow's ox for a pledge. ^2403

They thrust the poor off the road; the poor of the earth all hide themselves. ^2404

Behold, like wild donkeys in the desert the poor go out to their toil, seeking game; the wasteland yields food for their children. ^2405

They gather their fodder in the field, and they glean the vineyard of the wicked man. ^2406

They lie all night naked, without clothing, and have no covering in the cold. ^2407

They are wet with the rain of the mountains and cling to the rock for lack of shelter. ^2408

(There are those who snatch the fatherless child from the breast, and they take a pledge against the poor.) ^2409

They go about naked, without clothing; hungry, they carry the sheaves; ^2410

among the olive rows of the wicked they make oil; they tread the winepresses, but suffer thirst. ^2411

From out of the city the dying groan, and the soul of the wounded cries for help; yet God charges no one with wrong. ^2412

There are those who rebel against the light, who are not acquainted with its ways, and do not stay in its paths. ^2413

The murderer rises before it is light, that he may kill the poor and needy, and in the night he is like a thief. ^2414

The eye of the adulterer also waits for the twilight, saying, 'No eye will see me'; and he veils his face. ^2415

In the dark they dig through houses; by day they shut themselves up; they do not know the light. ^2416

For deep darkness is morning to all of them; for they are friends with the terrors of deep darkness. ^2417

You say, 'Swift are they on the face of the waters; their portion is cursed in the land; no treader turns toward their vineyards. ^2418

Drought and heat snatch away the snow waters; so does Sheol those who have sinned. ^2419

The womb forgets them; the worm finds them sweet; they are no longer remembered, so wickedness is broken like a tree.' ^2420

They wrong the barren childless woman, and do no good to the widow. ^2421

Yet God prolongs the life of the mighty by his power; they rise up when they despair of life. ^2422

He gives them security, and they are supported, and his eyes are upon their ways. ^2423

They are exalted a little while, and then are gone; they are brought low and gathered up like all others; they are cut off like the heads of grain. ^2424

If it is not so, who will prove me a liar and show that there is nothing in what I say? ^2425


Then Bildad the Shuhite answered and said: ^2501

Dominion and fear are with God; he makes peace in his high heaven. ^2502

Is there any number to his armies? Upon whom does his light not arise? ^2503

How then can man be in the right before God? How can he who is born of woman be pure? ^2504

Behold, even the moon is not bright, and the stars are not pure in his eyes; ^2505

how much less man, who is a maggot, and the son of man, who is a worm! ^2506


Then Job answered and said: ^2601

How you have helped him who has no power! How you have saved the arm that has no strength! ^2602

How you have counseled him who has no wisdom, and plentifully declared sound knowledge! ^2603

With whose help have you uttered words, and whose breath has come out from you? ^2604

The dead tremble under the waters and their inhabitants. ^2605

Sheol is naked before God, and Abaddon has no covering. ^2606

He stretches out the north over the void and hangs the earth on nothing. ^2607

He binds up the waters in his thick clouds, and the cloud is not split open under them. ^2608

He covers the face of the full moon and spreads over it his cloud. ^2609

He has inscribed a circle on the face of the waters at the boundary between light and darkness. ^2610

The pillars of heaven tremble and are astounded at his rebuke. ^2611

By his power he stilled the sea; by his understanding he shattered Rahab. ^2612

By his wind the heavens were made fair; his hand pierced the fleeing serpent. ^2613

Behold, these are but the outskirts of his ways, and how small a whisper do we hear of him! But the thunder of his power who can understand? ^2614


And Job again took up his discourse, and said: ^2701

As God lives, who has taken away my right, and the Almighty, who has made my soul bitter, ^2702

as long as my breath is in me, and the spirit of God is in my nostrils, ^2703

my lips will not speak falsehood, and my tongue will not utter deceit. ^2704

Far be it from me to say that you are right; till I die I will not put away my integrity from me. ^2705

I hold fast my righteousness and will not let it go; my heart does not reproach me for any of my days. ^2706

Let my enemy be as the wicked, and let him who rises up against me be as the unrighteous. ^2707

For what is the hope of the godless when God cuts him off, when God takes away his life? ^2708

Will God hear his cry when distress comes upon him? ^2709

Will he take delight in the Almighty? Will he call upon God at all times? ^2710

I will teach you concerning the hand of God; what is with the Almighty I will not conceal. ^2711

Behold, all of you have seen it yourselves; why then have you become altogether vain? ^2712

This is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage that oppressors receive from the Almighty: ^2713

If his children are multiplied, it is for the sword, and his descendants have not enough bread. ^2714

Those who survive him the pestilence buries, and his widows do not weep. ^2715

Though he heap up silver like dust, and pile up clothing like clay, ^2716

he may pile it up, but the righteous will wear it, and the innocent will divide the silver. ^2717

He builds his house like a moth's, like a booth that a watchman makes. ^2718

He goes to bed rich, but will do so no more; he opens his eyes, and his wealth is gone. ^2719

Terrors overtake him like a flood; in the night a whirlwind carries him off. ^2720

The east wind lifts him up and he is gone; it sweeps him out of his place. ^2721

It hurls at him without pity; he flees from its power in headlong flight. ^2722

It claps its hands at him and hisses at him from its place. ^2723


Surely there is a mine for silver, and a place for gold that they refine. ^2801

Iron is taken out of the earth, and copper is smelted from the ore. ^2802

Man puts an end to darkness and searches out to the farthest limit the ore in gloom and deep darkness. ^2803

He opens shafts in a valley away from where anyone lives; they are forgotten by travelers; they hang in the air, far away from mankind; they swing to and fro. ^2804

As for the earth, out of it comes bread, but underneath it is turned up as by fire. ^2805

Its stones are the place of sapphires, and it has dust of gold. ^2806

That path no bird of prey knows, and the falcon's eye has not seen it. ^2807

The proud beasts have not trodden it; the lion has not passed over it. ^2808

Man puts his hand to the flinty rock and overturns mountains by the roots. ^2809

He cuts out channels in the rocks, and his eye sees every precious thing. ^2810

He dams up the streams so that they do not trickle, and the thing that is hidden he brings out to light. ^2811

But where shall wisdom be found? And where is the place of understanding? ^2812

Man does not know its worth, and it is not found in the land of the living. ^2813

The deep says, 'It is not in me,' and the sea says, 'It is not with me.' ^2814

It cannot be bought for gold, and silver cannot be weighed as its price. ^2815

It cannot be valued in the gold of Ophir, in precious onyx or sapphire. ^2816

Gold and glass cannot equal it, nor can it be exchanged for jewels of fine gold. ^2817

No mention shall be made of coral or of crystal; the price of wisdom is above pearls. ^2818

The topaz of Ethiopia cannot equal it, nor can it be valued in pure gold. ^2819

From where, then, does wisdom come? And where is the place of understanding? ^2820

It is hidden from the eyes of all living and concealed from the birds of the air. ^2821

Abaddon and Death say, 'We have heard a rumor of it with our ears.' ^2822

God understands the way to it, and he knows its place. ^2823

For he looks to the ends of the earth and sees everything under the heavens. ^2824

When he gave to the wind its weight and apportioned the waters by measure, ^2825

when he made a decree for the rain and a way for the lightning of the thunder, ^2826

then he saw it and declared it; he established it, and searched it out. ^2827

And he said to man, 'Behold, the fear of the Lord, that is wisdom, and to turn away from evil is understanding.' ^2828


And Job again took up his discourse, and said: ^2901

Oh, that I were as in the months of old, as in the days when God watched over me, ^2902

when his lamp shone upon my head, and by his light I walked through darkness, ^2903

as I was in my prime, when the friendship of God was upon my tent, ^2904

when the Almighty was yet with me, when my children were all around me, ^2905

when my steps were washed with butter, and the rock poured out for me streams of oil! ^2906

When I went out to the gate of the city, when I prepared my seat in the square, ^2907

the young men saw me and withdrew, and the aged rose and stood; ^2908

the princes refrained from talking and laid their hand on their mouth; ^2909

the voice of the nobles was hushed, and their tongue stuck to the roof of their mouth. ^2910

When the ear heard, it called me blessed, and when the eye saw, it approved, ^2911

because I delivered the poor who cried for help, and the fatherless who had none to help him. ^2912

The blessing of him who was about to perish came upon me, and I caused the widow's heart to sing for joy. ^2913

I put on righteousness, and it clothed me; my justice was like a robe and a turban. ^2914

I was eyes to the blind and feet to the lame. ^2915

I was a father to the needy, and I searched out the cause of him whom I did not know. ^2916

I broke the fangs of the unrighteous and made him drop his prey from his teeth. ^2917

Then I thought, 'I shall die in my nest, and I shall multiply my days as the sand, ^2918

my roots spread out to the waters, with the dew all night on my branches, ^2919

my glory fresh with me, and my bow ever new in my hand.' ^2920

Men listened to me and waited and kept silence for my counsel. ^2921

After I spoke they did not speak again, and my word dropped upon them. ^2922

They waited for me as for the rain, and they opened their mouths as for the spring rain. ^2923

I smiled on them when they had no confidence, and the light of my face they did not cast down. ^2924

I chose their way and sat as chief, and I lived like a king among his troops, like one who comforts mourners. ^2925


But now they laugh at me, men who are younger than I, whose fathers I would have disdained to set with the dogs of my flock. ^3001

What could I gain from the strength of their hands, men whose vigor is gone? ^3002

Through want and hard hunger they gnaw the dry ground by night in waste and desolation; ^3003

they pick saltwort and the leaves of bushes, and the roots of the broom tree for their food. ^3004

They are driven out from human company; they shout after them as after a thief. ^3005

In the gullies of the torrents they must dwell, in holes of the earth and of the rocks. ^3006

Among the bushes they bray; under the nettles they huddle together. ^3007

A senseless, a nameless brood, they have been whipped out of the land. ^3008

And now I have become their song; I am a byword to them. ^3009

They abhor me; they keep aloof from me; they do not hesitate to spit at the sight of me. ^3010

Because God has loosed my cord and humbled me, they have cast off restraint in my presence. ^3011

On my right hand the rabble rise; they push away my feet; they cast up against me their ways of destruction. ^3012

They break up my path; they promote my calamity; they need no one to help them. ^3013

As through a wide breach they come; amid the crash they roll on. ^3014

Terrors are turned upon me; my honor is pursued as by the wind, and my prosperity has passed away like a cloud. ^3015

And now my soul is poured out within me; days of affliction have taken hold of me. ^3016

The night racks my bones, and the pain that gnaws me takes no rest. ^3017

With great force my garment is disfigured; it binds me about like the collar of my tunic. ^3018

God has cast me into the mire, and I have become like dust and ashes. ^3019

I cry to you for help and you do not answer me; I stand, and you only look at me. ^3020

You have turned cruel to me; with the might of your hand you persecute me. ^3021

You lift me up on the wind; you make me ride on it, and you toss me about in the roar of the storm. ^3022

For I know that you will bring me to death and to the house appointed for all living. ^3023

Yet does not one in a heap of ruins stretch out his hand, and in his disaster cry for help? ^3024

Did not I weep for him whose day was hard? Was not my soul grieved for the needy? ^3025

But when I hoped for good, evil came, and when I waited for light, darkness came. ^3026

My inward parts are in turmoil and never still; days of affliction come to meet me. ^3027

I go about darkened, but not by the sun; I stand up in the assembly and cry for help. ^3028

I am a brother of jackals and a companion of ostriches. ^3029

My skin turns black and falls from me, and my bones burn with heat. ^3030

My lyre is turned to mourning, and my pipe to the voice of those who weep. ^3031


I have made a covenant with my eyes; how then could I gaze at a virgin? ^3101

What would be my portion from God above and my heritage from the Almighty on high? ^3102

Is not calamity for the unrighteous, and disaster for the workers of iniquity? ^3103

Does not he see my ways and number all my steps? ^3104

If I have walked with falsehood and my foot has hastened to deceit; ^3105

(Let me be weighed in a just balance, and let God know my integrity!) ^3106

if my step has turned aside from the way and my heart has gone after my eyes, and if any spot has stuck to my hands, ^3107

then let me sow, and another eat, and let what grows for me be rooted out. ^3108

If my heart has been enticed toward a woman, and I have lain in wait at my neighbor's door, ^3109

then let my wife grind for another, and let others bow down on her. ^3110

For that would be a heinous crime; that would be an iniquity to be punished by the judges; ^3111

for that would be a fire that consumes as far as Abaddon, and it would burn to the root all my increase. ^3112

If I have rejected the cause of my manservant or my maidservant, when they brought a complaint against me, ^3113

what then shall I do when God rises up? When he makes inquiry, what shall I answer him? ^3114

Did not he who made me in the womb make him? And did not one fashion us in the womb? ^3115

If I have withheld anything that the poor desired, or have caused the eyes of the widow to fail, ^3116

or have eaten my morsel alone, and the fatherless has not eaten of it ^3117

(for from my youth the fatherless grew up with me as with a father, and from my mother's womb I guided the widow ), ^3118

if I have seen anyone perish for lack of clothing, or the needy without covering, ^3119

if his body has not blessed me, and if he was not warmed with the fleece of my sheep, ^3120

if I have raised my hand against the fatherless, because I saw my help in the gate, ^3121

then let my shoulder blade fall from my shoulder, and let my arm be broken from its socket. ^3122

For I was in terror of calamity from God, and I could not have faced his majesty. ^3123

If I have made gold my trust or called fine gold my confidence, ^3124

if I have rejoiced because my wealth was abundant or because my hand had found much, ^3125

if I have looked at the sun when it shone, or the moon moving in splendor, ^3126

and my heart has been secretly enticed, and my mouth has kissed my hand, ^3127

this also would be an iniquity to be punished by the judges, for I would have been false to God above. ^3128

If I have rejoiced at the ruin of him who hated me, or exulted when evil overtook him ^3129

(I have not let my mouth sin by asking for his life with a curse), ^3130

if the men of my tent have not said, 'Who is there that has not been filled with his meat?' ^3131

(the sojourner has not lodged in the street; I have opened my doors to the traveler), ^3132

if I have concealed my transgressions as others do by hiding my iniquity in my bosom, ^3133

because I stood in great fear of the multitude, and the contempt of families terrified me, so that I kept silence, and did not go out of doors-- ^3134

Oh, that I had one to hear me! (Here is my signature! Let the Almighty answer me!) Oh, that I had the indictment written by my adversary! ^3135

Surely I would carry it on my shoulder; I would bind it on me as a crown; ^3136

I would give him an account of all my steps; like a prince I would approach him. ^3137

If my land has cried out against me and its furrows have wept together, ^3138

if I have eaten its yield without payment and made its owners breathe their last, ^3139

let thorns grow instead of wheat, and foul weeds instead of barley.The words of Job are ended. ^3140


So these three men ceased to answer Job, because he was righteous in his own eyes. ^3201

Then Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite, of the family of Ram, burned with anger. He burned with anger at Job because he justified himself rather than God. ^3202

He burned with anger also at Job's three friends because they had found no answer, although they had declared Job to be in the wrong. ^3203

Now Elihu had waited to speak to Job because they were older than he. ^3204

And when Elihu saw that there was no answer in the mouth of these three men, he burned with anger. ^3205

And Elihu the son of Barachel the Buzite answered and said: I am young in years, and you are aged; therefore I was timid and afraid to declare my opinion to you. ^3206

I said, 'Let days speak, and many years teach wisdom.' ^3207

But it is the spirit in man, the breath of the Almighty, that makes him understand. ^3208

It is not the old who are wise, nor the aged who understand what is right. ^3209

Therefore I say, 'Listen to me; let me also declare my opinion.' ^3210

Behold, I waited for your words, I listened for your wise sayings, while you searched out what to say. ^3211

I gave you my attention, and, behold, there was none among you who refuted Job or who answered his words. ^3212

Beware lest you say, 'We have found wisdom; God may vanquish him, not a man.' ^3213

He has not directed his words against me, and I will not answer him with your speeches. ^3214

They are dismayed; they answer no more; they have not a word to say. ^3215

And shall I wait, because they do not speak, because they stand there, and answer no more? ^3216

I also will answer with my share; I also will declare my opinion. ^3217

For I am full of words; the spirit within me constrains me. ^3218

Behold, my belly is like wine that has no vent; like new wineskins ready to burst. ^3219

I must speak, that I may find relief; I must open my lips and answer. ^3220

I will not show partiality to any man or use flattery toward any person. ^3221

For I do not know how to flatter, else my Maker would soon take me away. ^3222


But now, hear my speech, O Job, and listen to all my words. ^3301

Behold, I open my mouth; the tongue in my mouth speaks. ^3302

My words declare the uprightness of my heart, and what my lips know they speak sincerely. ^3303

The Spirit of God has made me, and the breath of the Almighty gives me life. ^3304

Answer me, if you can; set your words in order before me; take your stand. ^3305

Behold, I am toward God as you are; I too was pinched off from a piece of clay. ^3306

Behold, no fear of me need terrify you; my pressure will not be heavy upon you. ^3307

Surely you have spoken in my ears, and I have heard the sound of your words. ^3308

You say, 'I am pure, without transgression; I am clean, and there is no iniquity in me. ^3309

Behold, he finds occasions against me, he counts me as his enemy, ^3310

he puts my feet in the stocks and watches all my paths.' ^3311

Behold, in this you are not right. I will answer you, for God is greater than man. ^3312

Why do you contend against him, saying, 'He will answer none of man's words'? ^3313

For God speaks in one way, and in two, though man does not perceive it. ^3314

In a dream, in a vision of the night, when deep sleep falls on men, while they slumber on their beds, ^3315

then he opens the ears of men and terrifies them with warnings, ^3316

that he may turn man aside from his deed and conceal pride from a man; ^3317

he keeps back his soul from the pit, his life from perishing by the sword. ^3318

Man is also rebuked with pain on his bed and with continual strife in his bones, ^3319

so that his life loathes bread, and his appetite the choicest food. ^3320

His flesh is so wasted away that it cannot be seen, and his bones that were not seen stick out. ^3321

His soul draws near the pit, and his life to those who bring death. ^3322

If there be for him an angel, a mediator, one of the thousand, to declare to man what is right for him, ^3323

and he is merciful to him, and says, 'Deliver him from going down into the pit; I have found a ransom; ^3324

let his flesh become fresh with youth; let him return to the days of his youthful vigor'; ^3325

then man prays to God, and he accepts him; he sees his face with a shout of joy, and he restores to man his righteousness. ^3326

He sings before men and says: 'I sinned and perverted what was right, and it was not repaid to me. ^3327

He has redeemed my soul from going down into the pit, and my life shall look upon the light.' ^3328

Behold, God does all these things, twice, three times, with a man, ^3329

to bring back his soul from the pit, that he may be lighted with the light of life. ^3330

Pay attention, O Job, listen to me; be silent, and I will speak. ^3331

If you have any words, answer me; speak, for I desire to justify you. ^3332

If not, listen to me; be silent, and I will teach you wisdom. ^3333


Then Elihu answered and said: ^3401

Hear my words, you wise men, and give ear to me, you who know; ^3402

for the ear tests words as the palate tastes food. ^3403

Let us choose what is right; let us know among ourselves what is good. ^3404

For Job has said, 'I am in the right, and God has taken away my right; ^3405

in spite of my right I am counted a liar; my wound is incurable, though I am without transgression.' ^3406

What man is like Job, who drinks up scoffing like water, ^3407

who travels in company with evildoers and walks with wicked men? ^3408

For he has said, 'It profits a man nothing that he should take delight in God.' ^3409

Therefore, hear me, you men of understanding: far be it from God that he should do wickedness, and from the Almighty that he should do wrong. ^3410

For according to the work of a man he will repay him, and according to his ways he will make it befall him. ^3411

Of a truth, God will not do wickedly, and the Almighty will not pervert justice. ^3412

Who gave him charge over the earth, and who laid on him the whole world? ^3413

If he should set his heart to it and gather to himself his spirit and his breath, ^3414

all flesh would perish together, and man would return to dust. ^3415

If you have understanding, hear this; listen to what I say. ^3416

Shall one who hates justice govern? Will you condemn him who is righteous and mighty, ^3417

who says to a king, 'Worthless one,' and to nobles, 'Wicked man,' ^3418

who shows no partiality to princes, nor regards the rich more than the poor, for they are all the work of his hands? ^3419

In a moment they die; at midnight the people are shaken and pass away, and the mighty are taken away by no human hand. ^3420

For his eyes are on the ways of a man, and he sees all his steps. ^3421

There is no gloom or deep darkness where evildoers may hide themselves. ^3422

For God has no need to consider a man further, that he should go before God in judgment. ^3423

He shatters the mighty without investigation and sets others in their place. ^3424

Thus, knowing their works, he overturns them in the night, and they are crushed. ^3425

He strikes them for their wickedness in a place for all to see, ^3426

because they turned aside from following him and had no regard for any of his ways, ^3427

so that they caused the cry of the poor to come to him, and he heard the cry of the afflicted-- ^3428

When he is quiet, who can condemn? When he hides his face, who can behold him, whether it be a nation or a man?-- ^3429

that a godless man should not reign, that he should not ensnare the people. ^3430

For has anyone said to God, 'I have borne punishment; I will not offend any more; ^3431

teach me what I do not see; if I have done iniquity, I will do it no more'? ^3432

Will he then make repayment to suit you, because you reject it? For you must choose, and not I; therefore declare what you know. ^3433

Men of understanding will say to me, and the wise man who hears me will say: ^3434

'Job speaks without knowledge; his words are without insight.' ^3435

Would that Job were tried to the end, because he answers like wicked men. ^3436

For he adds rebellion to his sin; he claps his hands among us and multiplies his words against God. ^3437


And Elihu answered and said: ^3501

Do you think this to be just? Do you say, 'It is my right before God,' ^3502

that you ask, 'What advantage have I? How am I better off than if I had sinned?' ^3503

I will answer you and your friends with you. ^3504

Look at the heavens, and see; and behold the clouds, which are higher than you. ^3505

If you have sinned, what do you accomplish against him? And if your transgressions are multiplied, what do you do to him? ^3506

If you are righteous, what do you give to him? Or what does he receive from your hand? ^3507

Your wickedness concerns a man like yourself, and your righteousness a son of man. ^3508

Because of the multitude of oppressions people cry out; they call for help because of the arm of the mighty. ^3509

But none says, 'Where is God my Maker, who gives songs in the night, ^3510

who teaches us more than the beasts of the earth and makes us wiser than the birds of the heavens?' ^3511

There they cry out, but he does not answer, because of the pride of evil men. ^3512

Surely God does not hear an empty cry, nor does the Almighty regard it. ^3513

How much less when you say that you do not see him, that the case is before him, and you are waiting for him! ^3514

And now, because his anger does not punish, and he does not take much note of transgression, ^3515

Job opens his mouth in empty talk; he multiplies words without knowledge. ^3516


And Elihu continued, and said: ^3601

Bear with me a little, and I will show you, for I have yet something to say on God's behalf. ^3602

I will get my knowledge from afar and ascribe righteousness to my Maker. ^3603

For truly my words are not false; one who is perfect in knowledge is with you. ^3604

Behold, God is mighty, and does not despise any; he is mighty in strength of understanding. ^3605

He does not keep the wicked alive, but gives the afflicted their right. ^3606

He does not withdraw his eyes from the righteous, but with kings on the throne he sets them forever, and they are exalted. ^3607

And if they are bound in chains and caught in the cords of affliction, ^3608

then he declares to them their work and their transgressions, that they are behaving arrogantly. ^3609

He opens their ears to instruction and commands that they return from iniquity. ^3610

If they listen and serve him, they complete their days in prosperity, and their years in pleasantness. ^3611

But if they do not listen, they perish by the sword and die without knowledge. ^3612

The godless in heart cherish anger; they do not cry for help when he binds them. ^3613

They die in youth, and their life ends among the cult prostitutes. ^3614

He delivers the afflicted by their affliction and opens their ear by adversity. ^3615

He also allured you out of distress into a broad place where there was no cramping, and what was set on your table was full of fatness. ^3616

But you are full of the judgment on the wicked; judgment and justice seize you. ^3617

Beware lest wrath entice you into scoffing, and let not the greatness of the ransom turn you aside. ^3618

Will your cry for help avail to keep you from distress, or all the force of your strength? ^3619

Do not long for the night, when peoples vanish in their place. ^3620

Take care; do not turn to iniquity, for this you have chosen rather than affliction. ^3621

Behold, God is exalted in his power; who is a teacher like him? ^3622

Who has prescribed for him his way, or who can say, 'You have done wrong'? ^3623

Remember to extol his work, of which men have sung. ^3624

All mankind has looked on it; man beholds it from afar. ^3625

Behold, God is great, and we know him not; the number of his years is unsearchable. ^3626

For he draws up the drops of water; they distill his mist in rain, ^3627

which the skies pour down and drop on mankind abundantly. ^3628

Can anyone understand the spreading of the clouds, the thunderings of his pavilion? ^3629

Behold, he scatters his lightning about him and covers the roots of the sea. ^3630

For by these he judges peoples; he gives food in abundance. ^3631

He covers his hands with the lightning and commands it to strike the mark. ^3632

Its crashing declares his presence; the cattle also declare that he rises. ^3633


At this also my heart trembles and leaps out of its place. ^3701

Keep listening to the thunder of his voice and the rumbling that comes from his mouth. ^3702

Under the whole heaven he lets it go, and his lightning to the corners of the earth. ^3703

After it his voice roars; he thunders with his majestic voice, and he does not restrain the lightnings when his voice is heard. ^3704

God thunders wondrously with his voice; he does great things that we cannot comprehend. ^3705

For to the snow he says, 'Fall on the earth,' likewise to the downpour, his mighty downpour. ^3706

He seals up the hand of every man, that all men whom he made may know it. ^3707

Then the beasts go into their lairs, and remain in their dens. ^3708

From its chamber comes the whirlwind, and cold from the scattering winds. ^3709

By the breath of God ice is given, and the broad waters are frozen fast. ^3710

He loads the thick cloud with moisture; the clouds scatter his lightning. ^3711

They turn around and around by his guidance, to accomplish all that he commands them on the face of the habitable world. ^3712

Whether for correction or for his land or for love, he causes it to happen. ^3713

Hear this, O Job; stop and consider the wondrous works of God. ^3714

Do you know how God lays his command upon them and causes the lightning of his cloud to shine? ^3715

Do you know the balancings of the clouds, the wondrous works of him who is perfect in knowledge, ^3716

you whose garments are hot when the earth is still because of the south wind? ^3717

Can you, like him, spread out the skies, hard as a cast metal mirror? ^3718

Teach us what we shall say to him; we cannot draw up our case because of darkness. ^3719

Shall it be told him that I would speak? Did a man ever wish that he would be swallowed up? ^3720

And now no one looks on the light when it is bright in the skies, when the wind has passed and cleared them. ^3721

Out of the north comes golden splendor; God is clothed with awesome majesty. ^3722

The Almighty--we cannot find him; he is great in power; justice and abundant righteousness he will not violate. ^3723

Therefore men fear him; he does not regard any who are wise in their own conceit. ^3724


Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind and said: ^3801

Who is this that darkens counsel by words without knowledge? ^3802

Dress for action like a man; I will question you, and you make it known to me. ^3803

Where were you when I laid the foundation of the earth? Tell me, if you have understanding. ^3804

Who determined its measurements--surely you know! Or who stretched the line upon it? ^3805

On what were its bases sunk, or who laid its cornerstone, ^3806

when the morning stars sang together and all the sons of God shouted for joy? ^3807

Or who shut in the sea with doors when it burst out from the womb, ^3808

when I made clouds its garment and thick darkness its swaddling band, ^3809

and prescribed limits for it and set bars and doors, ^3810

and said, 'Thus far shall you come, and no farther, and here shall your proud waves be stayed'? ^3811

Have you commanded the morning since your days began, and caused the dawn to know its place, ^3812

that it might take hold of the skirts of the earth, and the wicked be shaken out of it? ^3813

It is changed like clay under the seal, and its features stand out like a garment. ^3814

From the wicked their light is withheld, and their uplifted arm is broken. ^3815

Have you entered into the springs of the sea, or walked in the recesses of the deep? ^3816

Have the gates of death been revealed to you, or have you seen the gates of deep darkness? ^3817

Have you comprehended the expanse of the earth? Declare, if you know all this. ^3818

Where is the way to the dwelling of light, and where is the place of darkness, ^3819

that you may take it to its territory and that you may discern the paths to its home? ^3820

You know, for you were born then, and the number of your days is great! ^3821

Have you entered the storehouses of the snow, or have you seen the storehouses of the hail, ^3822

which I have reserved for the time of trouble, for the day of battle and war? ^3823

What is the way to the place where the light is distributed, or where the east wind is scattered upon the earth? ^3824

Who has cleft a channel for the torrents of rain and a way for the thunderbolt, ^3825

to bring rain on a land where no man is, on the desert in which there is no man, ^3826

to satisfy the waste and desolate land, and to make the ground sprout with grass? ^3827

Has the rain a father, or who has begotten the drops of dew? ^3828

From whose womb did the ice come forth, and who has given birth to the frost of heaven? ^3829

The waters become hard like stone, and the face of the deep is frozen. ^3830

Can you bind the chains of the Pleiades or loose the cords of Orion? ^3831

Can you lead forth the Mazzaroth in their season, or can you guide the Bear with its children? ^3832

Do you know the ordinances of the heavens? Can you establish their rule on the earth? ^3833

Can you lift up your voice to the clouds, that a flood of waters may cover you? ^3834

Can you send forth lightnings, that they may go and say to you, 'Here we are'? ^3835

Who has put wisdom in the inward parts or given understanding to the mind? ^3836

Who can number the clouds by wisdom? Or who can tilt the waterskins of the heavens, ^3837

when the dust runs into a mass and the clods stick fast together? ^3838

Can you hunt the prey for the lion, or satisfy the appetite of the young lions, ^3839

when they crouch in their dens or lie in wait in their thicket? ^3840

Who provides for the raven its prey, when its young ones cry to God for help, and wander about for lack of food? ^3841


Do you know when the mountain goats give birth? Do you observe the calving of the does? ^3901

Can you number the months that they fulfill, and do you know the time when they give birth, ^3902

when they crouch, bring forth their offspring, and are delivered of their young? ^3903

Their young ones become strong; they grow up in the open; they go out and do not return to them. ^3904

Who has let the wild donkey go free? Who has loosed the bonds of the swift donkey, ^3905

to whom I have given the arid plain for his home and the salt land for his dwelling place? ^3906

He scorns the tumult of the city; he hears not the shouts of the driver. ^3907

He ranges the mountains as his pasture, and he searches after every green thing. ^3908

Is the wild ox willing to serve you? Will he spend the night at your manger? ^3909

Can you bind him in the furrow with ropes, or will he harrow the valleys after you? ^3910

Will you depend on him because his strength is great, and will you leave to him your labor? ^3911

Do you have faith in him that he will return your grain and gather it to your threshing floor? ^3912

The wings of the ostrich wave proudly, but are they the pinions and plumage of love? ^3913

For she leaves her eggs to the earth and lets them be warmed on the ground, ^3914

forgetting that a foot may crush them and that the wild beast may trample them. ^3915

She deals cruelly with her young, as if they were not hers; though her labor be in vain, yet she has no fear, ^3916

because God has made her forget wisdom and given her no share in understanding. ^3917

When she rouses herself to flee, she laughs at the horse and his rider. ^3918

Do you give the horse his might? Do you clothe his neck with a mane? ^3919

Do you make him leap like the locust? His majestic snorting is terrifying. ^3920

He paws in the valley and exults in his strength; he goes out to meet the weapons. ^3921

He laughs at fear and is not dismayed; he does not turn back from the sword. ^3922

Upon him rattle the quiver, the flashing spear and the javelin. ^3923

With fierceness and rage he swallows the ground; he cannot stand still at the sound of the trumpet. ^3924

When the trumpet sounds, he says 'Aha!' He smells the battle from afar, the thunder of the captains, and the shouting. ^3925

Is it by your understanding that the hawk soars and spreads his wings toward the south? ^3926

Is it at your command that the eagle mounts up and makes his nest on high? ^3927

On the rock he dwells and makes his home, on the rocky crag and stronghold. ^3928

From there he spies out the prey; his eyes behold it afar off. ^3929

His young ones suck up blood, and where the slain are, there is he. ^3930


And the LORD said to Job: ^4001

Shall a faultfinder contend with the Almighty? He who argues with God, let him answer it. ^4002

Then Job answered the LORD and said: ^4003

Behold, I am of small account; what shall I answer you? I lay my hand on my mouth. ^4004

I have spoken once, and I will not answer; twice, but I will proceed no further. ^4005

Then the LORD answered Job out of the whirlwind and said: ^4006

Dress for action like a man; I will question you, and you make it known to me. ^4007

Will you even put me in the wrong? Will you condemn me that you may be in the right? ^4008

Have you an arm like God, and can you thunder with a voice like his? ^4009

Adorn yourself with majesty and dignity; clothe yourself with glory and splendor. ^4010

Pour out the overflowings of your anger, and look on everyone who is proud and abase him. ^4011

Look on everyone who is proud and bring him low and tread down the wicked where they stand. ^4012

Hide them all in the dust together; bind their faces in the world below. ^4013

Then will I also acknowledge to you that your own right hand can save you. ^4014

Behold, Behemoth, which I made as I made you; he eats grass like an ox. ^4015

Behold, his strength in his loins, and his power in the muscles of his belly. ^4016

He makes his tail stiff like a cedar; the sinews of his thighs are knit together. ^4017

His bones are tubes of bronze, his limbs like bars of iron. ^4018

He is the first of the works of God; let him who made him bring near his sword! ^4019

For the mountains yield food for him where all the wild beasts play. ^4020

Under the lotus plants he lies, in the shelter of the reeds and in the marsh. ^4021

For his shade the lotus trees cover him; the willows of the brook surround him. ^4022

Behold, if the river is turbulent he is not frightened; he is confident though Jordan rushes against his mouth. ^4023

Can one take him by his eyes, or pierce his nose with a snare? ^4024


Can you draw out Leviathan with a fishhook or press down his tongue with a cord? ^4101

Can you put a rope in his nose or pierce his jaw with a hook? ^4102

Will he make many pleas to you? Will he speak to you soft words? ^4103

Will he make a covenant with you to take him for your servant forever? ^4104

Will you play with him as with a bird, or will you put him on a leash for your girls? ^4105

Will traders bargain over him? Will they divide him up among the merchants? ^4106

Can you fill his skin with harpoons or his head with fishing spears? ^4107

Lay your hands on him; remember the battle--you will not do it again! ^4108

Behold, the hope of a man is false; he is laid low even at the sight of him. ^4109

No one is so fierce that he dares to stir him up. Who then is he who can stand before me? ^4110

Who has first given to me, that I should repay him? Whatever is under the whole heaven is mine. ^4111

I will not keep silence concerning his limbs, or his mighty strength, or his goodly frame. ^4112

Who can strip off his outer garment? Who would come near him with a bridle? ^4113

Who can open the doors of his face? Around his teeth is terror. ^4114

His back is made of rows of shields, shut up closely as with a seal. ^4115

One is so near to another that no air can come between them. ^4116

They are joined one to another; they clasp each other and cannot be separated. ^4117

His sneezings flash forth light, and his eyes are like the eyelids of the dawn. ^4118

Out of his mouth go flaming torches; sparks of fire leap forth. ^4119

Out of his nostrils comes forth smoke, as from a boiling pot and burning rushes. ^4120

His breath kindles coals, and a flame comes forth from his mouth. ^4121

In his neck abides strength, and terror dances before him. ^4122

The folds of his flesh stick together, firmly cast on him and immovable. ^4123

His heart is hard as a stone, hard as the lower millstone. ^4124

When he raises himself up the mighty are afraid; at the crashing they are beside themselves. ^4125

Though the sword reaches him, it does not avail, nor the spear, the dart, or the javelin. ^4126

He counts iron as straw, and bronze as rotten wood. ^4127

The arrow cannot make him flee; for him sling stones are turned to stubble. ^4128

Clubs are counted as stubble; he laughs at the rattle of javelins. ^4129

His underparts are like sharp potsherds; he spreads himself like a threshing sledge on the mire. ^4130

He makes the deep boil like a pot; he makes the sea like a pot of ointment. ^4131

Behind him he leaves a shining wake; one would think the deep to be white-haired. ^4132

On earth there is not his like, a creature without fear. ^4133

He sees everything that is high; he is king over all the sons of pride. ^4134


Then Job answered the LORD and said: ^4201

I know that you can do all things, and that no purpose of yours can be thwarted. ^4202

'Who is this that hides counsel without knowledge?' Therefore I have uttered what I did not understand, things too wonderful for me, which I did not know. ^4203

'Hear, and I will speak; I will question you, and you make it known to me.' ^4204

I had heard of you by the hearing of the ear, but now my eye sees you; ^4205

therefore I despise myself, and repent in dust and ashes. ^4206

After the LORD had spoken these words to Job, the LORD said to Eliphaz the Temanite: My anger burns against you and against your two friends, for you have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has. ^4207

Now therefore take seven bulls and seven rams and go to my servant Job and offer up a burnt offering for yourselves. And my servant Job shall pray for you, for I will accept his prayer not to deal with you according to your folly. For you have not spoken of me what is right, as my servant Job has. ^4208

So Eliphaz the Temanite and Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite went and did what the LORD had told them, and the LORD accepted Job's prayer. ^4209

And the LORD restored the fortunes of Job, when he had prayed for his friends. And the LORD gave Job twice as much as he had before. ^4210

Then came to him all his brothers and sisters and all who had known him before, and ate bread with him in his house. And they showed him sympathy and comforted him for all the evil that the LORD had brought upon him. And each of them gave him a piece of money and a ring of gold. ^4211

And the LORD blessed the latter days of Job more than his beginning. And he had 14,000 sheep, 6,000 camels, 1,000 yoke of oxen, and 1,000 female donkeys. ^4212

He had also seven sons and three daughters. ^4213

And he called the name of the first daughter Jemimah, and the name of the second Keziah, and the name of the third Keren-happuch. ^4214

And in all the land there were no women so beautiful as Job's daughters. And their father gave them an inheritance among their brothers. ^4215

And after this Job lived 140 years, and saw his sons, and his sons' sons, four generations. ^4216

And Job died, an old man, and full of days. ^4217
