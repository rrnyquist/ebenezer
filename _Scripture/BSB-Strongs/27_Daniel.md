[[H7969|In the third]] [[H8141|year]] [[H4438|of the reign]] [[H3079|of Jehoiakim]] [[H4428|king]] [[H3063|of Judah,]] [[H5019|Nebuchadnezzar]] [[H4428|king]] [[H894|of Babylon]] [[H935|came]] [[H3389|to Jerusalem]] [[H6696|and besieged]] [[H5921|it.]] ^0101

[[H136|And the Lord]] [[H5414|delivered]] [[H3027|into his hand]] [[H3079|Jehoiakim]] [[H4428|king]] [[H3063|of Judah,]] [[H7117|along with some]] [[H3627|of the articles]] [[H1004|from the house]] [[H430|of God.]] [[H935|He carried off]] ⟨these⟩ [[H776|to the land]] [[H8152|of Shinar,]] [[H1004|to the house]] [[H430|of his god,]] ⟨where⟩ [[H853|]] [[H935|he put]] ⟨them⟩ [[H3627|]] [[H1004|into the treasury]] [[H430|of his god.]] ^0102

[[H4428|Then the king]] [[H559|ordered]] [[H828|Ashpenaz,]] [[H7227|the chief]] [[H5631|of his court officials,]] [[H935|to bring in]] [[H4480|some]] [[H1121|Israelites]] [[H4410|from the royal]] [[H2233|family]] [[H6579|and the nobility—]] ^0103

[[H3206|young men]] [[H369|without]] [[H3971|blemish,]] [[H2896|handsome,]] [[H7919|gifted]] [[H3605|in all]] [[H2451|wisdom,]] [[H3045|knowledgeable,]] [[H4093|quick]] [[H995|to understand,]] [[H3581|and qualified]] [[H5975|to serve]] [[H4428|in the king’s]] [[H1964|palace—]] [[H3925|and to teach them]] [[H3956|the language]] [[H5612|and literature]] [[H3778|of the Chaldeans.]] ^0104

[[H4428|The king]] [[H4487|assigned]] [[H3117|them  daily]] [[H1697|provisions]] [[H4428|of the royal]] [[H6598|food]] [[H3196|and wine.]] [[H1431|They were to be trained]] [[H7969|for three]] [[H8141|years,]] [[H7117|at the end]] [[H5975|of which they were to enter]] [[H4428|the king’s service.]] ^0105

[[H1961|Among these were some]] ⟨young men⟩ ⟨from⟩ [[H1121|]] [[H3063|Judah:]] [[H1840|Daniel,]] [[H2608|Hananiah,]] [[H4332|Mishael,]] [[H5838|and Azariah.]] ^0106

[[H8269|The chief]] [[H5631|official]] [[H7760|gave]] [[H8034|them new names:]] [[H1840|To Daniel]] [[H7760|he gave]] [[H1095|the name Belteshazzar;]] [[H2608|to Hananiah,]] [[H7714|Shadrach;]] [[H4332|to Mishael,]] [[H4335|Meshach;]] [[H5838|and to Azariah,]] [[H5664|Abednego.]] ^0107

[[H1840|But Daniel]] [[H7760|resolved]] [[H5921|in]] [[H3820|his heart]] [[H834|that]] [[H3808|he would not]] [[H1351|defile]] [[H4428|himself with the king’s]] [[H6598|food]] [[H3196|or wine.]] [[H1245|So he asked]] [[H8269|the chief]] [[H5631|official]] [[H834|for permission]] [[H3808|not]] [[H1351|to defile himself.]] ^0108

[[H430|Now God]] [[H5414|had granted]] [[H1840|Daniel]] [[H2617|favor]] [[H7356|and compassion]] [[H6440|from]] [[H8269|the chief]] [[H5631|official,]] ^0109

[[H8269|but he]] [[H559|said]] [[H1840|to Daniel,]] [[H589|“I]] [[H3373|fear]] [[H113|my lord]] [[H4428|the king,]] [[H834|who]] [[H4487|has assigned]] [[H3978|your food]] [[H4960|and drink.]] [[H834|For]] [[H4100|why]] [[H7200|should he see]] [[H6440|your faces]] [[H2196|looking thinner]] [[H4480|than]] [[H3206|those of the other young men]] [[H1524|your age?]] [[H2325|You would endanger]] [[H7218|my head]] [[H4428|before the king.]] ^0110

[[H1840|Then Daniel]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H4453|the steward]] [[H834|whom]] [[H8269|the chief]] [[H5631|official]] [[H4487|had set]] [[H5921|over]] [[H1840|Daniel,]] [[H2608|Hananiah,]] [[H4332|Mishael,]] [[H5838|and Azariah,]] ^0111

[[H4994|“Please]] [[H5254|test]] [[H5650|your servants]] [[H6235|for ten]] [[H3117|days.]] [[H5414|Let us be given]] [[H2235|only vegetables]] [[H398|to eat]] [[H4325|and water]] [[H8354|to drink.]] ^0112

[[H7200|Then compare]] [[H4758|our appearances]] [[H4758|with those]] [[H3206|of the young men]] [[H398|who are eating]] [[H4428|the royal]] [[H6598|food,]] [[H6213|and deal]] [[H5973|with]] [[H5650|your servants]] [[H834|according to what]] [[H7200|you see.”]] ^0113

[[H8085|So he consented]] [[H2088|to this]] [[H5254|and tested them]] [[H6235|for ten]] [[H3117|days.]] ^0114

[[H4480|And at]] [[H7117|the end]] [[H6235|of ten]] [[H3117|days,]] [[H7200|their appearance was]] [[H2896|better]] [[H1277|and healthier]] [[H3605|than all]] [[H3206|the young men]] [[H398|who were eating]] [[H4428|the king’s]] [[H6598|food.]] ^0115

[[H1961|Thus]] [[H4453|the steward]] [[H5375|continued to withhold]] [[H6598|their choice food]] [[H3196|and the wine]] [[H4960|they were to drink,]] [[H5414|and he gave]] [[H2235|them  vegetables]] ⟨instead⟩. ^0116

[[H428|To these]] [[H702|four]] [[H3206|young men]] [[H430|God]] [[H5414|gave]] [[H4093|knowledge]] [[H7919|and understanding]] [[H3605|in every kind]] [[H5612|of literature]] [[H2451|and wisdom.]] [[H1840|And Daniel]] [[H995|had insight]] [[H3605|into all kinds]] [[H2377|of visions]] [[H2472|and dreams.]] ^0117

[[H7117|Now at the end]] [[H3117|of the time]] [[H559|specified]] [[H4428|by the king,]] [[H8269|the chief]] [[H5631|official]] [[H935|presented]] [[H6440|them to]] [[H5019|Nebuchadnezzar.]] ^0118

[[H4428|And the king]] [[H1696|spoke with them,]] [[H854|and among]] [[H3605|all]] ⟨the young men⟩ [[H4672|he found]] [[H3808|no one]] [[H1840|equal to Daniel,]] [[H2608|Hananiah,]] [[H4332|Mishael,]] [[H5838|and Azariah.]] [[H5975|So they entered]] [[H4428|the king's service.]] ^0119

[[H3605|In every]] [[H1697|matter]] [[H2451|of wisdom]] [[H998|and understanding]] [[H834|about which]] [[H4428|the king]] [[H1245|consulted]] [[H1992|them,]] [[H4672|he found them]] [[H6235|ten]] [[H3027|times]] [[H5921|better than]] [[H3605|all]] [[H825|the magicians]] [[H2748|and enchanters]] [[H3605|in his entire]] [[H4438|kingdom.]] ^0120

[[H1840|And Daniel]] [[H1961|remained]] [[H5704|there until]] [[H259|the first]] [[H8141|year]] [[H4428|of King]] [[H3566|Cyrus.]] ^0121

[[H8147|In the second]] [[H8141|year]] [[H5019|of his]] [[H4438|reign,]] [[H5019|Nebuchadnezzar]] [[H2492|had dreams]] [[H6470|that troubled]] [[H7307|his spirit,]] [[H8142|and sleep]] [[H1961|deserted]] [[H5921|him.]] ^0201

[[H4428|So the king]] [[H559|gave orders]] [[H7121|to summon]] [[H825|the magicians,]] [[H2748|enchanters,]] [[H3784|sorcerers,]] [[H3778|and astrologers]] [[H5046|to explain]] [[H2472|his dreams.]] [[H935|When they came]] [[H5975|and stood]] [[H6440|before]] [[H4428|the king,]] ^0202

[[H4428|he]] [[H559|said to them,]] [[H2472|“I have had a dream,]] [[H7307|and my spirit]] [[H6470|is anxious]] [[H3045|to understand]] [[H2472|it.”]] ^0203

[[H3778|Then the astrologers]] [[H1696|answered]] [[H4428|the king]] [[H762|in Aramaic,]] [[H4430|“O king,]] [[H2418|may you live]] [[H5957|forever!]] [[H560|Tell]] [[H5649|your servants]] [[H2493|the dream,]] [[H2324|and we will give]] [[H6591|the interpretation.”]] ^0204

[[H4430|The king]] [[H6032|replied]] [[H3779|to the astrologers,]] [[H4406|“My word]] [[H230|is final:]] [[H2006|If]] [[H3809|you do not]] [[H3046|tell me]] [[H2493|the dream]] [[H6591|and its interpretation,]] [[H5648|you will be cut]] [[H1917|into pieces]] [[H1005|and your houses]] [[H7761|will be reduced]] [[H5122|to rubble.]] ^0205

[[H2006|But if]] [[H2324|you tell me]] [[H2493|the dream]] [[H6591|and its interpretation,]] [[H6902|you will receive]] [[H4481|from]] [[H6925|me]] [[H4978|gifts]] [[H5023|and rewards]] [[H7690|and great]] [[H3367|honor.]] [[H2006|So]] [[H2324|tell me]] [[H2493|the dream]] [[H6591|and its interpretation.”]] ^0206

[[H6032|They answered]] [[H8579|a second time,]] [[H4430|“Let the king]] [[H560|tell]] [[H2493|the dream]] [[H5649|to his servants,]] [[H2324|and we will give]] [[H6591|the interpretation.”]] ^0207

[[H4430|The king]] [[H6032|replied,]] [[H576|“I]] [[H3046|know]] [[H4481|for]] [[H3330|sure]] [[H608|you]] [[H2084|are stalling]] [[H5732|for time,]] [[H6903|because]] [[H2370|you see]] [[H1768|that]] [[H4481|my]] [[H4406|word]] [[H230|is final.]] ^0208

[[H2006|If]] [[H3809|you do not]] [[H3046|tell]] [[H2493|me the dream,]] ⟨there⟩ [[H1932|is]] ⟨only⟩ [[H2298|one]] [[H1882|decree for you.]] [[H2164|You have conspired]] [[H560|to speak]] [[H6925|before me]] [[H3538|FALSE]] [[H7844|and fraudulent]] [[H4406|words,]] [[H5705|hoping]] [[H5732|the situation]] [[H8133|will change.]] [[H2006|Therefore]] [[H560|tell]] [[H2493|me  the dream,]] [[H3046|and I will know]] [[H1768|that]] [[H2324|you can give me]] [[H6591|its interpretation.]] ^0209

[[H3779|The astrologers]] [[H6032|answered]] [[H4430|the king,]] [[H3809|“No]] [[H5922|one]] [[H3007|on earth]] [[H3202|can]] [[H2324|do]] [[H4430|what the king]] [[H4406|requests!]] [[H3809|No]] [[H4430|king,]] [[H7229|however great]] [[H7990|and powerful,]] [[H7593|has ever asked]] [[H4406|anything]] [[H1836|like this]] [[H3606|of any]] [[H826|magician,]] [[H2749|enchanter,]] [[H3779|or astrologer.]] ^0210

[[H1768|What]] [[H4430|the king]] [[H7593|requests]] [[H3358|is so difficult]] [[H3809|that no]] [[H321|one]] [[H2324|can tell it]] [[H6925|to]] [[H4430|him]] [[H3861|except]] [[H426|the gods,]] [[H1768|whose]] [[H4070|dwelling]] [[H383|is]] [[H3809|not]] [[H5974|with]] [[H1321|mortals.”]] ^0211

[[H6903|This made]] ⟨response⟩ [[H4430|the king]] [[H7690|so]] [[H1149|angry]] [[H7108|and furious]] [[H560|that he gave orders]] [[H7|to destroy]] [[H3606|all]] [[H2445|the wise men]] [[H895|of Babylon.]] ^0212

[[H1882|So the decree]] [[H5312|went out]] [[H2445|that the wise men]] [[H6992|were to be executed,]] [[H1156|and men went to look for]] [[H1841|Daniel]] [[H2269|and his friends]] [[H6992|to execute them.]] ^0213

[[H116|When]] [[H746|Arioch,]] [[H7229|the commander]] [[H4430|of the king’s]] [[H2877|guard,]] [[H5312|had gone out]] [[H6992|to execute]] [[H2445|the wise men]] [[H895|of Babylon,]] [[H1841|Daniel]] [[H8421|replied]] [[H5843|with discretion]] [[H2942|and tact.]] ^0214

[[H5922|“Why]] [[H1882|is the decree]] [[H4481|from]] [[H4430|the king]] [[H2685|so harsh?”]] [[H6032|he asked.]] [[H116|At this time]] [[H746|Arioch]] [[H3046|explained]] [[H4406|the situation]] [[H1841|to Daniel.]] ^0215

[[H1841|So Daniel]] [[H5954|went in]] [[H1156|and asked]] [[H4430|the king]] [[H5415|to give]] [[H2166|him  some time,]] [[H2324|so that he could give]] ⟨him⟩ [[H4430|]] [[H6591|the interpretation.]] ^0216

[[H116|Then]] [[H1841|Daniel]] [[H236|returned]] [[H1005|to his house]] [[H3046|and explained]] [[H4406|the matter]] [[H2269|to his friends]] [[H2608|Hananiah,]] [[H4333|Mishael,]] [[H5839|and Azariah,]] ^0217

[[H1156|urging them to plead]] [[H7359|for mercy]] [[H6925|from]] [[H426|the God]] [[H8065|of heaven]] [[H5922|concerning]] [[H1836|this]] [[H7328|mystery,]] [[H1768|so that]] [[H1841|Daniel]] [[H2269|and his friends]] [[H3809|would not]] [[H7|be killed]] [[H5974|with]] [[H7606|the rest]] [[H2445|of the wise]] ⟨men⟩ [[H895|of Babylon.]] ^0218

[[H116|During]] [[H3916|the night,]] [[H7328|the mystery]] [[H1541|was revealed]] [[H1841|to Daniel]] [[H2376|in a vision,]] [[H1841|and]] ⟨he⟩ [[H1289|blessed]] [[H426|the God]] [[H8065|of heaven]] ^0219

[[H1932|He]] [[H8133|changes]] [[H5732|the times]] [[H2166|and seasons;]] [[H5709|He removes]] [[H4430|kings]] [[H6966|and establishes]] ⟨them⟩ [[H4430|.]] [[H3052|He gives]] [[H2452|wisdom]] [[H2445|to the wise]] [[H4486|and knowledge]] [[H3046|to the discerning.]] ^0221

[[H1932|He]] [[H1541|reveals]] [[H5994|the deep]] [[H5642|and hidden things;]] [[H3046|He knows]] [[H4101|what]] [[H2816|lies in darkness,]] [[H5094|and light]] [[H8271|dwells]] [[H5974|with Him.]] ^0222

[[H426|To You,  O God]] [[H2|of my fathers,]] [[H576|I]] [[H3029|give thanks]] [[H7624|and praise,]] [[H1768|because]] [[H3052|You have given me]] [[H2452|wisdom]] [[H1370|and power.]] [[H3705|And now]] [[H3046|You have made known to me]] [[H1768|what]] [[H1156|we have requested,]] [[H1768|for]] [[H3046|You have made known to us]] [[H4406|the dream]] [[H4430|of the king.]] ^0223

[[H6903|Therefore]] [[H1841|Daniel]] [[H5954|went]] [[H5922|to]] [[H746|Arioch,]] [[H1768|whom]] [[H4430|the king]] [[H4483|had appointed]] [[H7|to destroy]] [[H2445|the wise men]] [[H895|of Babylon,]] [[H560|and said]] [[H409|to him,  “Do not]] [[H7|execute]] [[H2445|the wise men]] [[H895|of Babylon!]] [[H5954|Bring]] [[H6925|me before]] [[H4430|the king,]] [[H2324|and I will give]] [[H4430|him]] [[H6591|the interpretation.]] ^0224

[[H746|Arioch]] [[H927|hastily]] [[H5954|brought]] [[H1841|Daniel]] [[H6925|before]] [[H4430|the king]] [[H560|and said]] [[H7912|to him,  “I have found]] [[H1400|a man]] [[H4481|among]] [[H1123|the exiles]] [[H3061|from Judah]] [[H1768|who]] [[H3046|will tell]] [[H4430|the king]] [[H6591|the interpretation.”]] ^0225

[[H607|You,]] [[H4430|O king,]] [[H4430|are the king]] [[H4430|of kings,]] [[H1768|to whom]] [[H426|the God]] [[H8065|of heaven]] [[H3052|has given]] [[H4437|sovereignty,]] [[H2632|power,]] [[H8632|strength,]] [[H3367|and glory.]] ^0237

[[H3606|Wherever]] [[H1123|the sons]] [[H606|of men]] [[H2423|or beasts]] [[H1251|of the field]] [[H5776|or birds]] [[H8065|of the air]] [[H1753|dwell,]] [[H3052|He has given]] ⟨them⟩ [[H3028|into your hand]] [[H7981|and has made you ruler]] [[H3606|over them all.]] [[H607|You]] ⟨are⟩ [[H607|that]] [[H7217|head]] [[H1768|of]] [[H1722|gold.]] ^0238

[[H870|But after you,]] [[H6966|there will arise]] [[H317|another]] [[H4437|kingdom,]] [[H772|inferior]] [[H4481|to yours.]] [[H317|Next, a]] [[H8523|third]] [[H4437|kingdom,]] [[H1768|one of]] [[H5174|bronze,]] [[H7981|will rule]] [[H3606|the whole]] [[H772|earth.]] ^0239

[[H1934|Finally, there will be]] [[H7244|a fourth]] [[H4437|kingdom]] [[H8624|as strong]] [[H6523|as iron;]] [[H6903|for]] [[H6523|iron]] [[H1855|shatters]] [[H2827|and crushes]] [[H3606|all things,]] [[H6523|and like iron]] [[H1768|that]] [[H7490|crushes]] [[H3606|all things,]] [[H1855|it will shatter]] [[H7490|and crush]] [[H3606|all]] [[H459|the others.]] ^0240

[[H1768|And just as]] [[H2370|you saw that]] [[H7271|the feet]] [[H677|and toes]] [[H4481|were made partly of]] [[H2635|fired clay]] [[H4481|and partly of]] [[H6523|iron,]] [[H1934|so this will be]] [[H6386|a divided]] [[H4437|kingdom,]] [[H6903|yet]] [[H1768|some of]] [[H5326|the strength]] [[H1768|of]] [[H6523|iron]] [[H1934|will be in it—]] [[H2370|just as you saw]] [[H6523|the iron]] [[H6151|mixed]] [[H2635|with clay.]] ^0241

[[H677|And as the toes]] [[H7271|of the feet]] [[H4481|were partly]] [[H6523|iron]] [[H4481|and partly]] [[H2635|clay,]] [[H4437|so this kingdom]] [[H1934|will be]] [[H7118|partly]] [[H8624|strong]] [[H4481|and partly]] [[H8406|brittle.]] ^0242

[[H2370|As you saw]] [[H6523|the iron]] [[H6151|mixed]] [[H2635|with clay,]] [[H2234|so the peoples]] [[H6151|will mix with one another,]] [[H3809|but will not]] [[H1693|hold together]] [[H1768|any more than]] [[H6523|iron]] [[H6151|mixes]] [[H5974|with]] [[H2635|clay.]] ^0243

[[H3118|In the days]] [[H581|of those]] [[H4430|kings,]] [[H426|the God]] [[H8065|of heaven]] [[H6966|will set up]] [[H4437|a kingdom]] [[H1768|that]] [[H5957|will never]] [[H2255|be destroyed,]] [[H4437|and this kingdom]] [[H3809|will not]] [[H7662|be left]] [[H321|to another]] [[H5972|people.]] [[H1855|It will shatter]] [[H3606|all]] [[H459|these]] [[H4437|kingdoms]] [[H5487|and bring them to an end,]] [[H6966|but will itself stand]] [[H5957|forever.]] ^0244

[[H3606|And just as]] [[H2370|you saw]] [[H69|a stone]] [[H1505|cut out]] [[H2906|of the mountain]] [[H3809|without]] [[H3028|human hands,]] [[H1855|and it shattered]] [[H6523|the iron,]] [[H5174|bronze,]] [[H2635|clay,]] [[H3702|silver,]] [[H1722|and gold,]] [[H7229|so the great]] [[H426|God]] [[H3046|has told]] [[H4430|the king]] [[H4101|what]] [[H1934|will happen]] [[H311|in the future.]] [[H2493|The dream]] [[H3330|is true,]] [[H6591|and its interpretation]] [[H540|is trustworthy.]] ^0245

[[H4430|The king]] [[H6032|said]] [[H1841|to Daniel,]] [[H426|“Your God]] [[H4481|is truly]] [[H426|the God]] [[H426|of gods]] [[H4756|and Lord]] [[H4430|of kings,]] [[H1541|a revealer]] [[H7328|of mysteries,]] [[H1768|since]] [[H3202|you were able]] [[H1541|to reveal]] [[H1836|this]] [[H7328|mystery.”]] ^0247

[[H116|Then]] [[H4430|the king]] [[H7236|promoted]] [[H1841|Daniel]] [[H3052|and gave]] [[H7690|him many]] [[H7229|generous]] [[H4978|gifts.]] [[H7981|He made him ruler]] [[H5922|over]] [[H3606|the entire]] [[H4083|province]] [[H895|of Babylon]] [[H5460|and administrator]] [[H5922|over]] [[H3606|all]] [[H2445|the wise men]] [[H895|of Babylon.]] ^0248

[[H1841|And at Daniel’s]] [[H1156|request,]] [[H4430|the king]] [[H4483|appointed]] [[H7715|Shadrach,]] [[H4336|Meshach,]] [[H5665|and Abednego]] [[H5922|to]] [[H5673|manage]] [[H4083|the province]] [[H895|of Babylon,]] [[H1841|while Daniel]] [[H4430|remained at the king’s]] [[H8651|court.]] ^0249

[[H4430|King]] [[H5020|Nebuchadnezzar]] [[H5648|made]] [[H1722|a golden]] [[H6755|statue]] [[H8361|sixty]] [[H521|cubits]] [[H7314|high]] [[H8353|and six]] [[H521|cubits]] [[H6613|wide,]] [[H6966|and he set it up]] [[H1236|on the plain]] [[H1757|of Dura]] [[H4083|in the province]] [[H895|of Babylon.]] ^0301

[[H4430|Then King]] [[H5020|Nebuchadnezzar]] [[H7972|sent]] [[H3673|word to assemble]] [[H324|the satraps,]] [[H5460|prefects,]] [[H6347|governors,]] [[H148|advisers,]] [[H1411|treasurers,]] [[H1884|judges,]] [[H8614|magistrates,]] [[H3606|and all the other]] [[H7984|officials]] [[H4083|of the provinces]] [[H858|to attend]] [[H2597|the dedication]] [[H6755|of the statue]] ⟨he⟩ [[H4430|]] [[H6966|had set up.]] ^0302

[[H116|So]] [[H324|the satraps,]] [[H5460|prefects,]] [[H6347|governors,]] [[H148|advisers,]] [[H1411|treasurers,]] [[H1884|judges,]] [[H8614|magistrates,]] [[H3606|and all]] [[H7984|the rulers]] [[H4083|of the provinces]] [[H3673|assembled]] [[H2597|for the dedication]] [[H6755|of the statue]] [[H1768|that]] [[H4430|King]] [[H5020|Nebuchadnezzar]] [[H6966|had set up,]] [[H6966|and they stood]] [[H6903|before]] ⟨it⟩ [[H6755|.]] ^0303

[[H3744|Then the herald]] [[H2429|loudly]] [[H7123|proclaimed,]] [[H5972|“O peoples,]] [[H524|nations,]] [[H3961|and language,]] ⟨men of every⟩ ⟨this is what⟩ [[H560|you are commanded:]] ^0304

[[H3606|Therefore,]] [[H1768|as soon as]] [[H3606|all]] [[H5972|the people]] [[H8086|heard]] [[H7032|the sound]] [[H7162|of the horn,]] [[H4953|flute,]] [[H7030|zither,]] [[H5443|lyre,]] [[H6460|harp,]] [[H3606|and all]] [[H2178|kinds]] [[H2170|of music,]] [[H5972|the people]] [[H3606|of every]] [[H524|nation]] [[H3961|and language]] [[H5308|fell down]] [[H5457|and worshiped]] [[H1722|the golden]] [[H6755|statue]] [[H1768|that]] [[H4430|King]] [[H5020|Nebuchadnezzar]] [[H6966|had set up.]] ^0307

[[H1836|At this time]] [[H3779|some astrologers]] [[H7127|came forward]] [[H399|and maliciously]] [[H7170|accused]] [[H3062|the Jews,]] ^0308

[[H6032|saying]] [[H4430|to King]] [[H5020|Nebuchadnezzar,]] [[H4430|“O king,]] [[H2418|may you live]] [[H5957|forever!]] ^0309

[[H607|You,]] [[H4430|O king,]] [[H7761|have issued]] [[H2942|a decree]] [[H1768|that]] [[H3606|everyone]] [[H1768|who]] [[H8086|hears]] [[H7032|the sound]] [[H7162|of the horn,]] [[H4953|flute,]] [[H7030|zither,]] [[H5443|lyre,]] [[H6460|harp,]] [[H5481|pipes,]] [[H3606|and all]] [[H2178|kinds]] [[H2170|of music]] [[H5308|must fall down]] [[H5457|and worship]] [[H1722|the golden]] [[H6755|statue,]] ^0310

[[H383|But there are]] [[H3062|some Jews]] [[H4483|you have appointed]] [[H5922|to manage]] [[H4083|the province]] [[H895|of Babylon—]] [[H7715|Shadrach,]] [[H4336|Meshach,]] [[H5665|and Abednego—]] ⟨who⟩ [[H479|]] [[H3809|have ignored]] [[H2942|you,]] [[H4430|O king,]] [[H3809|and have refused to]] [[H6399|serve]] [[H426|your gods]] [[H5457|or worship]] [[H1722|the golden]] [[H6755|statue]] [[H6966|you have set up.”]] ^0312

[[H116|Then]] [[H5020|Nebuchadnezzar,]] [[H2528|furious]] [[H7266|with rage,]] [[H560|summoned]] [[H7715|Shadrach,]] [[H4336|Meshach,]] [[H5665|and Abednego.]] [[H116|So]] [[H479|these]] [[H1400|men]] [[H858|were brought]] [[H6925|before]] [[H4430|the king,]] ^0313

[[H5020|and Nebuchadnezzar]] [[H560|said]] [[H7715|to them,  “Shadrach,]] [[H4336|Meshach,]] [[H5665|and Abednego,]] [[H6656|is it true]] [[H3809|that you do not]] [[H6399|serve]] [[H426|my gods]] [[H5457|or worship]] [[H1722|the golden]] [[H6755|statue]] [[H6966|I have set up?]] ^0314

[[H3705|Now,]] [[H2006|if]] [[H6263|you are ready,]] [[H5732|as soon as]] [[H8086|you hear]] [[H7032|the sound]] [[H7162|of the horn,]] [[H4953|flute,]] [[H7030|zither,]] [[H5443|lyre,]] [[H6460|harp,]] [[H5481|pipes,]] [[H3606|and all]] [[H2178|kinds]] [[H2170|of music,]] [[H5308|you must fall down]] [[H5457|and worship]] [[H6755|the statue]] [[H5648|I have made.]] [[H2006|But if]] [[H3809|you refuse]] [[H5457|to worship,]] [[H7412|you will be thrown]] [[H8160|immediately]] [[H1459|into]] [[H3345|the burning]] [[H5135|fiery]] [[H861|furnace.]] [[H4479|Then what]] [[H426|god]] [[H1932|will be able]] [[H7804|to deliver you]] [[H4481|from]] [[H3028|my hands?]] ^0315

[[H7715|Shadrach,]] [[H4336|Meshach,]] [[H5665|and Abednego]] [[H6032|replied]] [[H4430|to the king,]] [[H5020|“O Nebuchadnezzar,]] [[H586|we]] [[H3809|have]] [[H2818|no need]] [[H8421|to answer you]] [[H5922|in]] [[H1836|this]] [[H6600|matter.]] ^0316

[[H2006|If]] [[H426|the God]] [[H1768|whom]] [[H586|we]] [[H6399|serve]] [[H383|exists,]] [[H3202|then He is able]] [[H7804|to deliver us]] [[H4481|from]] [[H3345|the burning]] [[H5135|fiery]] [[H861|furnace]] [[H4481|and from]] [[H3028|your hand,]] [[H4430|O king.]] ^0317

[[H2006|But even if]] [[H3809|He does not,]] [[H1934|let it]] [[H3046|be known]] [[H4430|to you,  O king,]] [[H1768|that]] [[H3809|we will not]] [[H6399|serve]] [[H426|your gods]] [[H5457|or worship]] [[H1722|the golden]] [[H6755|statue]] [[H6966|you have set up.”]] ^0318

[[H116|At this,]] [[H5020|Nebuchadnezzar]] [[H4391|was filled]] [[H2528|with rage,]] [[H6755|and the expression]] [[H600|on his face]] [[H8133|changed]] [[H5922|toward]] [[H7715|Shadrach,]] [[H4336|Meshach,]] [[H5665|and Abednego.]] [[H6032|He gave orders]] [[H228|to heat]] [[H861|the furnace]] [[H7655|seven times]] [[H5922|hotter]] [[H1768|than]] [[H2370|usual,]] ^0319

[[H560|and he commanded]] [[H1401|mighty warriors]] [[H2429|in his army]] [[H3729|to tie up]] [[H7715|Shadrach,]] [[H4336|Meshach,]] [[H5665|and Abednego]] [[H7412|and throw them]] [[H3345|into the burning]] [[H5135|fiery]] [[H861|furnace.]] ^0320

[[H116|So]] ⟨they⟩ [[H479|]] [[H3729|were tied up,]] [[H5622|wearing robes,]] [[H6361|trousers,]] [[H3737|turbans,]] [[H3831|and other clothes,]] [[H7412|and they were thrown]] [[H1459|into]] [[H3345|the burning]] [[H5135|fiery]] [[H861|furnace.]] ^0321

[[H116|Suddenly]] [[H4430|King]] [[H5020|Nebuchadnezzar]] [[H6966|jumped up]] [[H927|in amazement]] [[H560|and asked]] [[H1907|his advisers,]] [[H3809|“Did we not]] [[H7412|throw]] [[H8532|three]] [[H1400|men,]] [[H3729|firmly bound,]] [[H1459|into]] [[H5135|the fire?”]] [[H3330|“Certainly,]] [[H4430|O king,”]] [[H6032|they replied.]] ^0324

[[H576|I,]] [[H5020|Nebuchadnezzar,]] [[H1934|was]] [[H7954|at ease]] [[H1005|in my house]] [[H7487|and flourishing]] [[H1965|in my palace.]] ^0404

[[H2370|I had]] [[H2493|a dream,]] [[H1763|and it frightened me;]] [[H5922|while in]] [[H4903|my bed,]] [[H2031|the images]] [[H2376|and visions]] [[H7217|in my mind]] [[H927|alarmed me.]] ^0405

[[H4481|So]] [[H7761|I issued]] [[H2942|a decree]] [[H3606|that all]] [[H2445|the wise men]] [[H895|of Babylon]] [[H5954|be brought]] [[H6925|before me]] [[H1768|to]] [[H6591|interpret]] [[H2493|the dream]] [[H3046|for me.]] ^0406

[[H116|When]] [[H2749|the magicians,]] [[H826|enchanters,]] [[H3779|astrologers,]] [[H1505|and diviners]] [[H5954|came in,]] [[H576|I]] [[H560|told]] [[H2493|them the dream,]] [[H3809|and they could not]] [[H6591|interpret it]] ^0407

[[H5705|But at]] [[H318|last,]] [[H1841|Daniel]] [[H5954|came into]] [[H6925|my presence]] [[H1768|(]] ⟨his⟩ [[H8036|name is]] [[H1096|Belteshazzar,]] [[H8036|after the name]] [[H426|of my god,]] [[H7308|and the spirit]] [[H6922|of the holy]] [[H426|gods]] [[H1768|is in him.)]] [[H560|And I told]] [[H2493|him the dream:]] ^0408

[[H1096|“O Belteshazzar,]] [[H7229|chief]] [[H2749|of the magicians,]] [[H1768|because]] [[H576|I]] [[H3046|know]] [[H1768|that]] [[H7308|you have a spirit]] [[H6922|of the holy]] [[H426|gods]] [[H3809|and that no]] [[H7328|mystery]] [[H598|baffles]] [[H560|you,  explain to me]] [[H2376|the visions]] [[H1768|that]] [[H2370|I saw]] [[H2493|in my dream,]] [[H6591|and the interpretation.]] ^0409

[[H2376|In these visions]] [[H7217|of my mind]] [[H5922|as I was lying]] [[H4903|in bed,]] [[H2370|I saw this]] [[H1934|come to pass:]] [[H431|There was]] [[H363|a tree]] [[H1459|in the middle]] [[H772|of the land,]] [[H7314|and its height]] [[H7690|was great.]] ^0410

[[H363|The tree]] [[H7236|grew large]] [[H8631|and strong;]] [[H7314|its top]] [[H4291|reached]] [[H8065|the sky,]] [[H2379|and it was visible]] [[H5491|to the ends]] [[H772|of the earth.]] ^0411

[[H6074|Its leaves]] [[H8209|were beautiful,]] [[H4|its fruit]] [[H7690|was abundant,]] [[H4203|and upon it  was food]] [[H3606|for all.]] [[H8460|Under it]] [[H2423|the beasts]] [[H1251|of the field]] [[H2927|found shelter,]] [[H6056|in its branches]] [[H6853|the birds]] [[H8065|of the air]] [[H1753|nested,]] [[H4481|and from it]] [[H3606|every]] [[H1321|creature]] [[H2110|was fed.]] ^0412

[[H5922|As I lay]] [[H4903|on my bed,]] [[H2370|I also saw]] [[H2376|in the visions]] [[H7217|of my mind]] [[H5894|a watcher,]] [[H6922|a holy one,]] [[H5182|coming down]] [[H4481|from]] [[H8065|heaven.]] ^0413

[[H7123|He called out]] [[H2429|in a loud voice:]] [[H1414|‘Cut down]] [[H363|the tree]] [[H7113|and chop off]] [[H6056|its branches;]] [[H5426|strip off]] [[H6074|its leaves]] [[H921|and scatter]] [[H4|its fruit.]] [[H2423|Let the beasts]] [[H5111|flee]] [[H4481|from]] [[H8479|under it,]] [[H6853|and the birds]] [[H4481|from]] [[H6056|its branches.]] ^0414

[[H1297|But]] [[H7662|leave]] [[H6136|the stump]] [[H8330|with its roots]] [[H772|in the ground,]] [[H613|and a band]] [[H1768|of]] [[H6523|iron]] [[H5174|and bronze around it,]] [[H1883|in the tender grass]] [[H1768|of]] [[H1251|the field.]] [[H6647|Let him be drenched]] [[H2920|with the dew]] [[H8065|of heaven]] [[H2508|and graze]] [[H5974|with]] [[H2423|the beasts]] [[H6211|on the grass]] [[H772|of the earth.]] ^0415

[[H3825|Let his mind]] [[H8133|be changed]] [[H4481|from]] [[H606|that of a man,]] [[H3052|and let him be given]] [[H3825|the mind]] [[H2423|of a beast]] [[H7655|till seven]] [[H5732|times]] [[H2499|pass]] [[H5922|him by.]] ^0416

[[H6600|This decision]] [[H1510|is the decree]] [[H5894|of the watchers,]] [[H7595|the verdict]] [[H3983|declared]] [[H6922|by the holy ones,]] [[H5705|so that]] [[H2417|the living]] [[H3046|will know]] [[H1768|that]] [[H5943|the Most High]] [[H7990|is ruler]] [[H4437|over the kingdom]] [[H606|of mankind,]] [[H5415|and gives it]] [[H4479|to whom]] [[H6634|He wishes,]] [[H6966|setting]] [[H5921|over it]] [[H8215|the lowliest]] [[H606|of men.]] ^0417

[[H1836|This]] [[H2493|is the dream]] [[H576|that I,]] [[H4430|King]] [[H5020|Nebuchadnezzar,]] [[H2370|had.]] [[H1096|Now, Belteshazzar,]] [[H560|tell]] [[H6591|me the interpretation,]] [[H6903|because]] [[H3606|none]] [[H2445|of the wise men]] [[H4437|of my kingdom]] [[H3202|can]] [[H6591|interpret it]] [[H3046|for me.]] [[H607|But you]] ⟨are⟩ [[H3546|able,]] [[H1768|because]] [[H7308|the spirit]] [[H6922|of the holy]] [[H426|gods]] ^0418

[[H116|For]] [[H2298|a]] [[H8160|time,]] [[H1841|Daniel,]] [[H1768|who]] [[H8036|was also known as]] [[H1096|Belteshazzar,]] [[H8075|was perplexed,]] [[H7476|and his thoughts]] [[H927|alarmed him.]] [[H4430|So the king]] [[H6032|said,]] [[H1096|“Belteshazzar,]] [[H409|do not]] [[H2493|let the dream]] [[H6591|or its interpretation]] [[H927|alarm you.”]] [[H4756|“My lord,”]] [[H6032|replied]] [[H1096|Belteshazzar,]] [[H2493|“may the dream]] [[H8131|apply to those who hate you,]] [[H6591|and its interpretation]] [[H6146|to your enemies!]] ^0419

[[H6074|whose foliage]] [[H8209|was beautiful]] [[H4|and its fruit]] [[H7690|abundant,]] [[H4203|providing food]] [[H3606|for all,]] [[H8460|under which]] [[H2423|the beasts]] [[H1251|of the field]] [[H1753|lived,]] [[H6056|and in whose branches]] [[H6853|the birds]] [[H8065|of the air]] [[H7932|nested—]] ^0421

[[H1768|And]] [[H4430|you, O king,]] [[H2370|saw]] [[H5894|a watcher,]] [[H6922|a holy one,]] [[H5182|coming down]] [[H4481|from]] [[H8065|heaven]] [[H560|and saying:]] [[H1414|‘Cut down]] [[H363|the tree]] [[H2255|and destroy it,]] [[H1297|but]] [[H7662|leave]] [[H6136|the stump]] [[H8330|with its roots]] [[H772|in the ground,]] [[H613|with a band]] [[H6523|of iron]] [[H5174|and bronze]] ⟨around it⟩, [[H1883|in the tender grass]] [[H1768|of]] [[H1251|the field.]] [[H6647|Let him be drenched]] [[H2920|with the dew]] [[H8065|of heaven,]] [[H2508|and graze]] [[H5974|with]] [[H2423|the beasts]] [[H1251|of the field]] [[H1768|till]] [[H7655|seven]] [[H5732|times]] [[H2499|pass]] [[H5922|him by.]] ^0423

[[H1836|This]] [[H6591|is the interpretation,]] [[H4430|O king,]] [[H1510|and this is the decree]] [[H5943|that the Most High]] [[H4291|has issued]] [[H5922|against]] [[H4756|my lord]] [[H4430|the king:]] ^0424

[[H2957|You will be driven away]] [[H4481|from]] [[H606|mankind,]] [[H4070|and your dwelling]] [[H1934|will be]] [[H5974|with]] [[H2423|the beasts]] [[H1251|of the field.]] [[H2939|You will feed on]] [[H6211|grass]] [[H8450|like cattle]] [[H6647|and be drenched]] [[H2920|with the dew]] [[H8065|of heaven,]] [[H7655|and seven]] [[H5732|times]] [[H2499|shall pass]] [[H5921|you by,]] [[H5705|until]] [[H3046|you acknowledge]] [[H1768|that]] [[H5943|the Most High]] [[H7990|is ruler]] [[H4437|over the kingdom]] [[H606|of mankind,]] [[H5415|and He gives]] [[H4479|it to anyone]] [[H6634|He wishes.]] ^0425

[[H560|As for the command]] [[H7662|to leave]] [[H6136|the stump]] [[H363|of the tree]] [[H8330|with its roots,]] [[H4437|your kingdom]] [[H7011|will be restored]] [[H4481|to you]] [[H1768|as soon as]] [[H3046|you acknowledge]] [[H1768|that]] [[H8065|Heaven]] [[H7990|rules.]] ^0426

[[H3861|Therefore,]] [[H4431|may my advice]] [[H8232|be pleasing]] [[H5921|to you,]] [[H4430|O king.]] [[H6562|Break away]] [[H2408|from your sins]] [[H6665|by doing what is right,]] [[H5758|and from your iniquities]] [[H2604|by showing mercy]] [[H6033|to the oppressed.]] [[H2006|Perhaps]] [[H1934|there will be]] [[H754|an extension]] [[H7963|of your prosperity.”]] ^0427

[[H3606|All]] [[H4291|this happened]] [[H5922|to]] [[H4430|King]] [[H5020|Nebuchadnezzar.]] ^0428

[[H8648|Twelve]] [[H3393|months]] [[H7118|later,]] [[H1934|as he was]] [[H1981|walking]] [[H5922|on]] [[H1965|the roof of the royal palace]] [[H1768|of]] [[H895|Babylon,]] ^0429

[[H4430|the king]] [[H6032|exclaimed,]] [[H1668|“Is this]] [[H3809|not]] [[H895|Babylon]] [[H7229|the Great,]] [[H1768|which]] [[H576|I myself]] [[H1124|have built]] [[H8632|by the might]] [[H2632|of my power]] [[H4437|as a royal]] [[H1005|residence]] [[H3367|and for the glory]] [[H1923|of my majesty?”]] ^0430

[[H4406|While the words]] [[H5751|were still]] [[H4430|in the king’s]] [[H6433|mouth,]] [[H7032|a voice]] [[H5308|came]] [[H4481|from]] [[H8065|heaven:]] [[H560|“It is decreed to you,]] [[H4430|King]] [[H5020|Nebuchadnezzar,]] [[H4437|that the kingdom]] [[H5709|has departed]] [[H4481|from you.]] ^0431

[[H2957|You will be driven away]] [[H4481|from]] [[H606|mankind]] [[H4070|to live]] [[H5974|with]] [[H2423|the beasts]] [[H1251|of the field,]] [[H2939|and you will feed on]] [[H6211|grass]] [[H8450|like cattle.]] [[H7655|And seven]] [[H5732|times]] [[H2499|will pass]] [[H5921|you by,]] [[H5705|until]] [[H3046|you acknowledge]] [[H1768|that]] [[H5943|the Most High]] [[H7990|is ruler]] [[H4437|over the kingdom]] [[H606|of men,]] [[H5415|and He gives]] [[H4479|it to anyone]] [[H6634|He wishes.]] ^0432

[[H8160|At that moment]] [[H4406|the sentence]] [[H5922|against]] [[H5020|Nebuchadnezzar]] [[H5487|was fulfilled.]] [[H2957|He was driven away]] [[H4481|from]] [[H606|mankind.]] [[H399|He ate]] [[H6211|grass]] [[H8450|like cattle,]] [[H1655|and his body]] [[H6647|was drenched]] [[H2920|with the dew]] [[H8065|of heaven,]] [[H5705|until]] [[H8177|his hair]] [[H7236|grew]] [[H5403|like an eagle]] ⟨the feathers of⟩ [[H2953|and his nails]] [[H6853|like a bird.]] ⟨the claws of⟩ ^0433

[[H7118|But at the end]] [[H3118|of those days,]] [[H576|I,]] [[H5020|Nebuchadnezzar,]] [[H5870|looked up]] [[H8065|to heaven,]] [[H4486|and my sanity]] [[H8421|was restored]] [[H5922|to me.]] [[H1289|Then I praised]] [[H5943|the Most High,]] [[H7624|and I honored]] [[H1922|and glorified]] [[H2417|Him who lives]] [[H5957|forever:]] [[H7985|“For His dominion]] [[H5957|is an everlasting]] [[H7985|dominion,]] [[H4437|and His kingdom]] [[H5974|endures from]] [[H1859|generation]] [[H1859|to generation.]] ^0434

[[H3606|All]] [[H1753|the peoples]] [[H772|of the earth]] [[H2804|are counted]] [[H3809|as nothing,]] [[H5648|and He does]] [[H6634|as He pleases]] [[H2429|with the army]] [[H8065|of heaven]] [[H1753|and the peoples]] [[H772|of the earth.]] [[H383|There is]] [[H3809|no]] [[H1768|one who]] [[H4223|can restrain]] [[H3028|His hand]] [[H560|or say]] [[H4101|to Him,  ‘What]] [[H5648|have You done?’”]] ^0435

[[H2166|At  the same time]] [[H4486|my sanity]] [[H8421|was restored]] [[H5922|to me,]] [[H1923|and my honor]] [[H2122|and splendor]] [[H8421|returned]] [[H5922|to me]] [[H3367|for the glory]] [[H4437|of my kingdom.]] [[H1907|My advisers]] [[H7261|and nobles]] [[H1156|sought me out,]] [[H8627|and I was restored]] [[H5922|to]] [[H4437|my throne,]] [[H3493|and surpassing]] [[H7238|greatness]] [[H3255|was added]] ^0436

[[H3705|Now]] [[H576|I,]] [[H5020|Nebuchadnezzar,]] [[H7624|praise]] [[H7313|and exalt]] [[H1922|and glorify]] [[H4430|the King]] [[H8065|of heaven,]] [[H1768|for]] [[H3606|all]] [[H4567|His works]] [[H7187|are true,]] [[H735|and all His ways]] [[H1780|are just.]] [[H1768|And those]] [[H1981|who walk]] [[H1467|in pride]] [[H3202|He is able]] [[H8214|to humble.]] ^0437

⟨Many years later⟩ [[H4430|King]] [[H1113|Belshazzar]] [[H5648|held]] [[H7229|a great]] [[H3900|feast]] [[H506|for a thousand]] [[H7261|of his nobles,]] [[H8355|and he drank]] [[H2562|wine]] [[H6903|with]] [[H506|them.]] ^0501

[[H2562|Under the influence of the wine,]] [[H1113|Belshazzar]] [[H560|gave orders]] [[H858|to bring]] [[H1722|in the gold]] [[H3702|and silver]] [[H3984|vessels]] [[H1768|that]] [[H5020|Nebuchadnezzar]] [[H2|his father]] [[H5312|had taken]] [[H4481|from]] [[H1965|the temple]] [[H3390|in Jerusalem,]] [[H4430|so that the king]] [[H8355|could drink]] [[H7261|from them,  along with his nobles,]] [[H7695|his wives,]] [[H3904|and his concubines.]] ^0502

[[H116|Thus]] [[H858|they brought in]] [[H1722|the gold]] [[H3984|vessels]] [[H1768|that]] [[H5312|had been taken]] [[H4481|from]] [[H1965|the temple,]] [[H1005|the house]] [[H426|of God]] [[H3390|in Jerusalem,]] [[H4430|and the king]] [[H8355|drank]] [[H7261|from them,  along with his nobles,]] [[H7695|his wives,]] [[H3904|and his concubines.]] ^0503

[[H8355|As they drank]] [[H2562|the wine,]] [[H7624|they praised]] [[H426|their gods]] [[H1722|of gold]] [[H3702|and silver,]] [[H5174|bronze]] [[H6523|and iron,]] [[H636|wood]] [[H69|and stone.]] ^0504

[[H8160|At  that moment]] [[H677|the fingers]] [[H1768|of]] [[H606|a human]] [[H3028|hand]] [[H5312|appeared]] [[H3790|and wrote]] [[H5922|on]] [[H1528|the plaster]] [[H1768|of]] [[H3797|the wall,]] [[H6903|near]] [[H5043|the lampstand]] [[H1768|in]] [[H4430|the royal]] [[H1965|palace.]] [[H4430|As the king]] [[H2370|watched]] [[H6447|the hand]] [[H1768|that]] [[H3790|was writing,]] ^0505

[[H2122|his face]] [[H8133|grew pale]] [[H7476|and his thoughts]] [[H927|so alarmed him]] [[H2783|that his hips]] [[H8271|gave way]] [[H755|and his knees]] [[H1668|knocked together.]] ^0506

[[H4430|The king]] [[H7123|called out for]] [[H826|the enchanters,]] [[H3779|astrologers,]] [[H1505|and diviners]] [[H5954|to be brought in,]] [[H4430|and he]] [[H560|said]] [[H2445|to these wise men]] [[H895|of Babylon,]] [[H1768|“Whoever]] [[H7123|reads]] [[H1836|this]] [[H3792|inscription]] [[H2324|and tells me]] [[H6591|its interpretation]] [[H3848|will be clothed]] [[H711|in purple]] [[H1722|and have a gold]] [[H2002|chain]] [[H5922|placed around]] [[H6676|his neck,]] [[H8523|and he will be made the third]] [[H7981|highest ruler]] [[H4437|in the kingdom.]] ^0507

[[H383|There is]] [[H1400|a man]] [[H4437|in your kingdom]] [[H1768|who]] [[H7308|has the spirit]] [[H6922|of the holy]] [[H426|gods in him.]] [[H3118|In the days]] [[H2|of your father]] [[H7912|he was found]] [[H5094|to have insight,]] [[H7924|intelligence,]] [[H2452|and wisdom]] [[H2452|like]] ⟨that⟩ [[H426|of the gods.]] [[H2|Your father,]] [[H4430|King]] [[H5020|Nebuchadnezzar,]] [[H6966|appointed]] [[H7229|him chief]] [[H2749|of the magicians,]] [[H826|enchanters,]] [[H3779|astrologers,]] ⟨and⟩ [[H1505|diviners.]] [[H2|Your own father,]] [[H4430|the king,]] ^0511

[[H3606|did this]] [[H6903|because]] [[H1841|Daniel,]] [[H1768|the one]] ⟨he⟩ [[H4430|]] [[H7761|named]] [[H1096|Belteshazzar,]] [[H7912|was found]] [[H3493|to have an extraordinary]] [[H7308|spirit,]] [[H4486|as well as knowledge,]] [[H7924|understanding,]] [[H6590|and the ability to interpret]] [[H2493|dreams,]] [[H263|explain]] [[H280|riddles,]] [[H8271|and solve]] [[H7001|difficult problems.]] [[H7123|Summon]] [[H1841|Daniel,]] [[H3705|therefore,]] [[H2324|and he will give you]] [[H6591|the interpretation.]] ^0512

[[H116|So]] [[H1841|Daniel]] [[H5954|was brought]] [[H6925|before]] [[H4430|the king,]] ⟨who⟩ [[H4430|]] [[H560|asked]] [[H1841|him,]] [[H607|“Are you]] [[H1841|Daniel,]] [[H1768|one]] [[H4481|of]] [[H1123|the exiles]] [[H2|my father]] [[H4430|the king]] [[H858|brought]] [[H4481|from]] [[H3061|Judah?]] ^0513

[[H8086|I have heard]] [[H1768|that]] [[H7308|the spirit]] [[H426|of the gods]] [[H5094|is in you,  and that you have insight,]] [[H7924|intelligence,]] [[H3493|and extraordinary]] [[H2452|wisdom.]] ^0514

[[H3705|Now]] [[H2445|the wise men]] [[H826|and enchanters]] [[H5954|were brought]] [[H6925|before me]] [[H7123|to read]] [[H1836|this]] [[H3792|inscription]] [[H6591|and interpret it]] [[H3046|for me,]] [[H3546|but they could]] [[H3809|not]] [[H2324|give]] [[H4406|its]] [[H6591|interpretation.]] ^0515

[[H576|But]] [[H8086|I have heard]] [[H5922|about you,]] [[H1768|that]] [[H3202|you are able]] [[H6591|to give interpretations]] [[H8271|and solve]] [[H7001|difficult problems.]] [[H3705|Therefore,]] [[H2006|if]] [[H3202|you can]] [[H7123|read]] [[H3792|this inscription]] [[H3046|and give]] [[H6591|me its interpretation,]] [[H3848|you will be clothed]] [[H711|in purple]] [[H1722|and have a gold]] [[H2002|chain]] [[H1768|placed around]] [[H6676|your neck,]] [[H8531|and you will be made the third]] [[H7981|highest ruler]] [[H4437|in the kingdom.]] ^0516

[[H116|In response,]] [[H1841|Daniel]] [[H560|said]] [[H4430|to the king,]] [[H1934|“You may keep]] [[H4978|your gifts]] [[H3052|for yourself  and give]] [[H5023|your rewards]] [[H321|to someone else.]] [[H1297|Nevertheless,]] [[H7123|I will read]] [[H3792|the inscription]] [[H4430|for the king]] [[H6591|and interpret it]] [[H3046|for him.]] ^0517

[[H607|As for you,]] [[H4430|O king,]] [[H5943|the Most High]] [[H426|God]] [[H3052|gave]] [[H2|your father]] [[H5020|Nebuchadnezzar]] [[H4437|sovereignty]] [[H7238|and greatness,]] [[H3367|glory]] [[H1923|and honor.]] ^0518

[[H4481|Because of]] [[H7238|the greatness]] [[H1768|that]] [[H3052|He bestowed]] [[H3606|on him,  all]] [[H5972|peoples,]] [[H524|nations,]] [[H3961|and language]] ⟨men of every⟩ [[H1934|trembled]] [[H1763|in fear]] [[H6925|before him.]] [[H6992|He killed]] [[H6634|whom he wished]] [[H2418|and kept alive]] [[H1768|whom]] [[H6634|he wished;]] [[H7313|he exalted]] [[H1768|whom]] [[H6634|he wished]] [[H8214|and humbled]] [[H1768|whom]] [[H6634|he wished.]] ^0519

[[H1768|But when]] [[H3825|his heart]] [[H7313|was exalted]] [[H7308|and his spirit]] [[H8631|hardened]] [[H2103|in pride,]] [[H5182|he was deposed]] [[H4481|from]] [[H4437|his royal]] [[H3764|throne,]] [[H3367|and his glory]] [[H5709|was taken]] [[H4481|from him.]] ^0520

[[H2957|He was driven away]] [[H4481|from]] [[H1123|mankind,]] [[H3825|and his mind]] [[H5974|was like]] ⟨that of⟩ [[H2423|a beast.]] [[H4070|He lived]] [[H5974|with]] [[H6167|the wild donkeys]] [[H2939|and ate]] [[H6211|grass]] [[H8450|like cattle,]] [[H1655|and his body]] [[H6647|was drenched]] [[H2920|with the dew]] [[H8065|of heaven]] [[H5705|until]] [[H3046|he acknowledged]] [[H1768|that]] [[H5943|the Most High]] [[H426|God]] [[H7990|is ruler]] [[H4437|over the kingdom]] [[H606|of mankind,]] [[H6966|and He sets]] [[H5921|over it]] [[H4479|whom]] [[H6634|He wishes.]] ^0521

[[H607|But you]] [[H1247|his son,]] [[H1113|O Belshazzar,]] [[H3809|have not]] [[H8214|humbled]] [[H3825|your heart,]] [[H6903|even though]] [[H3046|you knew]] [[H3606|all]] [[H1836|this.]] ^0522

[[H7313|Instead, you have exalted]] [[H5922|yourself against]] [[H4756|the Lord]] [[H8065|of heaven.]] [[H3984|The vessels]] [[H1768|from]] [[H1005|His house]] [[H858|were brought]] [[H6925|to you,]] [[H607|and as you]] [[H8355|drank]] [[H2562|wine from them]] [[H7261|with your nobles,]] [[H7695|wives,]] [[H3904|and concubines,]] [[H7624|you praised]] [[H426|gods]] [[H3702|of silver]] [[H1722|and gold,]] [[H5174|bronze]] [[H6523|and iron,]] [[H636|wood]] [[H69|and stone,]] [[H1768|which]] [[H3809|cannot]] [[H2370|see]] [[H3809|or]] [[H8086|hear]] [[H3809|or]] [[H3046|understand.]] [[H3809|But you have failed to]] [[H1922|glorify]] [[H426|the God]] [[H1768|who]] ⟨holds⟩ [[H3028|in His hand]] [[H5396|your very breath]] [[H3606|and all]] [[H735|your ways.]] ^0523

[[H116|Therefore]] [[H7972|He sent]] [[H3028|the hand]] [[H7560|that wrote]] [[H1836|the]] [[H3792|inscription.]] ^0524

[[H1836|Now this]] [[H3792|is the inscription]] [[H1768|that]] [[H7560|was written:]] [[H4484|MENE,]] [[H4484|MENE,]] [[H8625|TEKEL,]] [[H6537|PARSIN.]] ^0525

⟨And⟩ [[H1836|this]] [[H6591|is the interpretation]] [[H4406|of the message:]] [[H4484|MENE]] [[H426|means that God]] [[H4483|has numbered]] [[H4437|the days of your reign]] [[H8000|and brought it to an end.]] ^0526

[[H8625|TEKEL]] [[H8625|means that you have been weighed]] [[H3977|on the scales]] [[H7912|and found]] [[H2627|deficient.]] ^0527

[[H6537|PERES]] [[H4437|means that your kingdom]] [[H6537|has been divided]] [[H3052|and given over]] [[H4076|to the Medes]] [[H6540|and Persians.”]] ^0528

[[H116|Then]] [[H1113|Belshazzar]] [[H560|gave the command,]] [[H3848|and they clothed]] [[H1841|Daniel]] [[H711|in purple,]] [[H1722|placed a gold]] [[H2002|chain]] [[H5922|around]] [[H6676|his neck,]] [[H3745|and proclaimed]] [[H5922|him]] [[H8531|the third highest]] [[H7990|ruler]] [[H4437|in the kingdom.]] ^0529

[[H3916|That very night]] [[H1113|Belshazzar]] [[H4430|king]] [[H3779|of the Chaldeans]] [[H6992|was slain,]] ^0530

[[H1868|and Darius]] [[H6902|the Mede  received]] [[H4437|the kingdom]] [[H1247|at the age]] [[H8361|of sixty-two.]] ^0531

[[H8232|Now it]] [[H6925|pleased]] [[H1868|Darius]] [[H6966|to appoint]] [[H3969|120]] [[H324|satraps]] [[H1934|to rule]] [[H3606|throughout]] [[H4437|the kingdom,]] ^0601

[[H5924|and over]] [[H8532|them three]] [[H5632|administrators,]] [[H1841|including Daniel,]] [[H459|to whom  these]] [[H324|satraps]] [[H2941|were accountable]] [[H4430|so that the king]] [[H3809|would not]] [[H5142|suffer loss.]] ^0602

[[H116|Soon,]] [[H6903|by]] [[H3493|his extraordinary]] [[H7308|spirit,]] [[H1841|Daniel]] [[H5330|distinguished himself]] [[H5922|among]] [[H5632|the administrators]] [[H324|and satraps.]] [[H4430|So the king]] [[H6246|planned]] [[H6966|to set]] [[H5922|him over]] [[H3606|the whole]] [[H4437|kingdom.]] ^0603

[[H116|Thus]] [[H5632|the administrators]] [[H324|and satraps]] [[H1934|sought]] [[H5931|a charge]] [[H1841|against Daniel]] [[H6655|concerning]] [[H4437|the kingdom,]] [[H3202|but they could]] [[H7912|find]] [[H3606|no]] [[H5931|charge]] [[H7844|or corruption,]] [[H6903|because]] [[H1932|he]] [[H540|was trustworthy,]] [[H3606|and no]] [[H7960|negligence]] [[H7844|or corruption]] [[H7912|was found]] [[H5922|in him.]] ^0604

[[H116|Finally]] [[H479|these]] [[H1400|men]] [[H560|said,]] [[H3809|“We will never]] [[H7912|find]] [[H3606|any]] [[H5931|charge]] [[H1836|against this]] [[H1841|Daniel,]] [[H3861|unless]] [[H7912|we find]] ⟨something⟩ [[H5922|against him]] [[H1882|concerning the law]] [[H426|of his God.”]] ^0605

[[H116|So]] [[H5632|the administrators]] [[H324|and satraps]] [[H7284|went together]] [[H5922|to]] [[H4430|the king]] [[H560|and said,]] [[H4430|“O King]] [[H1868|Darius,]] [[H2418|may you live]] [[H5957|forever!]] ^0606

[[H3606|All]] [[H4437|the royal]] [[H5632|administrators,]] [[H5460|prefects,]] [[H324|satraps,]] [[H1907|advisers,]] [[H6347|and governors]] [[H3272|have agreed]] [[H4430|that the king]] [[H6966|should establish]] [[H7010|an ordinance]] [[H8631|and enforce]] [[H633|a decree]] [[H1768|that]] [[H5705|for]] [[H8533|thirty]] [[H3118|days]] [[H3606|anyone]] [[H1768|who]] [[H1156|petitions]] [[H3606|any]] [[H426|god]] [[H606|or man]] [[H3861|except you,]] [[H4430|O king,]] [[H7412|will be thrown]] [[H1358|into the den]] [[H744|of lions.]] ^0607

[[H3705|Therefore,]] [[H4430|O king,]] [[H6966|establish]] [[H633|the decree]] [[H7560|and sign]] [[H3792|the document]] [[H1768|so that]] [[H3809|it cannot]] [[H8133|be changed—]] [[H1882|in accordance with the law]] [[H4076|of the Medes]] [[H6540|and Persians,]] [[H1768|which]] [[H3809|cannot]] [[H5709|be repealed.”]] ^0608

[[H3606|Therefore]] [[H4430|King]] [[H1868|Darius]] [[H7560|signed]] [[H3792|the written]] [[H633|decree.]] ^0609

[[H1768|Now when]] [[H1841|Daniel]] [[H3046|learned]] [[H1768|that]] [[H3792|the document]] [[H7560|had been signed,]] [[H5954|he went]] [[H1005|into his house,]] [[H3551|where the windows]] [[H5952|of his  upper room]] [[H6606|opened]] [[H5049|toward]] [[H3390|Jerusalem,]] [[H8532|and three]] [[H2166|times]] [[H3118|a day]] [[H1932|he]] [[H1289|got down]] [[H5922|on]] [[H1291|his knees,]] [[H6739|prayed,]] [[H3029|and gave thanks]] [[H6925|to]] [[H426|his God,]] [[H6903|just as]] [[H5648|he had done]] [[H4481|before.]] ^0610

[[H116|Then]] [[H479|these]] [[H1400|men]] [[H7284|went as a group]] [[H7912|and found]] [[H1841|Daniel]] [[H1156|petitioning]] [[H2604|and imploring]] [[H426|his God.]] ^0611

[[H116|So]] [[H7127|they approached]] [[H4430|the king]] [[H560|and asked]] [[H5922|about]] [[H4430|his royal]] [[H633|decree:]] [[H3809|“Did you not]] [[H7560|sign]] [[H633|a decree]] [[H1768|that]] [[H5705|for]] [[H8533|thirty]] [[H3118|days]] [[H3606|any]] [[H606|man]] [[H1768|who]] [[H1156|petitions]] [[H3606|any]] [[H426|god]] [[H606|or man]] [[H3861|except you,]] [[H4430|O king,]] [[H7412|will be thrown]] [[H1358|into the den]] [[H744|of lions?]] [[H4430|The king]] [[H6032|replied,]] [[H1882|“According to the law]] [[H4076|of the Medes]] [[H6540|and Persians,]] [[H4406|the order]] [[H3330|stands]] [[H3809|and it cannot]] [[H5709|be repealed.]] ^0612

[[H116|Then]] [[H6032|they told]] [[H4430|the king,]] [[H1841|“Daniel,]] [[H1768|one]] [[H4481|of]] [[H1123|the exiles]] [[H1768|from]] [[H3061|Judah,]] [[H3809|shows no]] [[H7761|regard]] [[H5921|for you,]] [[H4430|O king,]] [[H633|or for the decree]] [[H1768|that]] [[H7560|you have signed.]] [[H1156|He still makes]] [[H1159|his petition]] [[H8532|three]] [[H2166|times]] [[H3118|a day.”]] ^0613

[[H1768|As soon as]] [[H4430|the king]] [[H8086|heard]] [[H4406|this,]] [[H7690|he was deeply]] [[H888|distressed]] [[H7761|and set]] ⟨his⟩ [[H1079|mind]] [[H7804|on delivering]] [[H1841|Daniel,]] [[H7712|and he labored]] [[H5705|until]] [[H4606|sundown]] [[H5338|to rescue him.]] ^0614

[[H116|Then]] [[H479|the]] [[H1400|men]] [[H7284|approached]] [[H4430|the king]] ⟨together⟩ [[H560|and said]] [[H4430|to him,]] [[H3046|“Remember,]] [[H4430|O king,]] [[H1882|that by the law]] [[H4076|of the Medes]] [[H6540|and Persians]] [[H3809|no]] [[H633|decree]] [[H7010|or ordinance]] [[H6966|established]] [[H4430|by the king]] [[H8133|can be changed.”]] ^0615

[[H116|So]] [[H4430|the king]] [[H560|gave the order,]] [[H858|and they brought]] [[H1841|Daniel]] [[H7412|and threw him]] [[H1358|into the den]] [[H1768|of]] [[H744|lions.]] [[H4430|The king]] [[H6032|said]] [[H1841|to Daniel,]] [[H426|“May your God,]] [[H1768|whom]] [[H607|you]] [[H6399|serve continually,]] [[H7804|deliver you!”]] ^0616

[[H2298|A]] [[H69|stone]] [[H858|was brought]] [[H7761|and placed]] [[H5922|over]] [[H6433|the mouth]] [[H1358|of the den,]] [[H4430|and the king]] [[H2857|sealed it]] [[H5824|with his own signet ring]] [[H5824|and with the rings]] [[H7261|of his nobles,]] [[H1768|so that]] [[H3809|nothing]] [[H1841|concerning Daniel]] [[H8133|could be changed.]] ^0617

[[H116|Then]] [[H4430|the king]] [[H236|went]] [[H1965|to his palace]] [[H956|and spent the night]] [[H2908|fasting.]] [[H3809|No]] [[H1761|entertainment]] [[H5954|was brought]] [[H6925|before him,]] [[H8139|and sleep]] [[H5075|fled]] [[H5922|from him.]] ^0618

[[H5053|At the first light]] [[H8238|of dawn,]] [[H4430|the king]] [[H6966|got up]] [[H927|and hurried]] [[H1358|to the den]] [[H1768|of]] [[H744|lions.]] ^0619

[[H7127|When he reached]] [[H1358|the den,]] [[H2200|he cried out]] [[H7032|in a voice]] [[H6088|of anguish,]] [[H1841|“O Daniel,]] [[H5649|servant]] [[H2417|of the living]] [[H426|God,]] [[H426|has your God,]] [[H1768|whom]] [[H607|you]] [[H6399|serve]] [[H8411|continually,]] [[H3202|been able]] [[H7804|to deliver you]] [[H4481|from]] [[H744|the lions?”]] ^0620

[[H116|Then]] [[H1841|Daniel]] [[H4449|replied,]] [[H4430|“O king,]] [[H2418|may you live]] [[H5957|forever!]] ^0621

[[H4430|The king]] [[H7690|was overjoyed]] [[H560|and gave orders]] [[H5267|to lift]] [[H1841|Daniel]] [[H4481|out of]] [[H1358|the den,]] [[H1841|and when Daniel]] [[H5267|was lifted]] [[H4481|out of]] [[H1358|the den,]] [[H3809|no]] [[H2257|wounds whatsoever]] [[H7912|were found]] [[H1768|on him,  because]] [[H540|he had trusted]] [[H426|in his God.]] ^0623

[[H7804|He delivers]] [[H5338|and rescues;]] [[H5648|He performs]] [[H852|signs]] [[H8540|and wonders]] [[H8065|in the heavens]] [[H772|and on the earth,]] [[H1768|for He]] [[H7804|has rescued]] [[H1841|Daniel]] [[H4481|from]] [[H3028|the power]] [[H744|of the lions.”]] ^0627

[[H1841|So Daniel]] [[H6744|prospered]] [[H4437|during the reigns]] [[H1868|of Darius]] [[H4437|and]] [[H3567|of Cyrus]] [[H6543|the Persian.]] ^0628

[[H2298|In the first]] [[H8140|year]] [[H4430|of the reign]] [[H1113|of Belshazzar]] [[H895|over Babylon,]] [[H1841|Daniel]] [[H2370|had]] [[H2493|a dream,]] [[H2376|and visions]] [[H7217|passed through his mind]] [[H5922|as he lay]] [[H4903|on his bed.]] [[H3790|He wrote down]] [[H2493|the dream,]] [[H7217|and this is the summary]] [[H4406|of his account.]] ^0701

[[H1841|Daniel]] [[H6032|declared:]] [[H2376|“In my vision]] [[H5974|in]] [[H3916|the night]] [[H1934|I]] [[H2370|looked,]] [[H718|and suddenly]] [[H703|the four]] [[H7308|winds]] [[H8065|of heaven]] [[H1519|were churning up]] [[H7229|the Great]] [[H3221|Sea.]] ^0702

[[H703|Then four]] [[H7260|great]] [[H2423|beasts]] [[H5559|came up]] [[H4481|out of]] [[H3221|the sea,]] [[H1668|each]] [[H8133|different]] [[H4481|from]] [[H1668|the others.]] ^0703

[[H6933|The first]] ⟨beast⟩ [[H744|was like a lion,]] [[H1611|and it had wings]] ⟨the⟩ [[H5403|of an eagle.]] [[H1934|I]] [[H2370|watched]] [[H5705|until]] [[H1611|its wings]] [[H4804|were torn off]] [[H5191|and it was lifted up]] [[H4481|from]] [[H772|the ground]] [[H6966|and made to stand]] [[H5922|on]] [[H7271|two feet]] [[H606|like a man,]] [[H3052|and given]] [[H3825|the mind]] [[H606|of a man.]] ^0704

[[H718|Suddenly]] [[H317|another]] [[H2423|beast]] ⟨appeared⟩, [[H8578|which]] [[H1821|looked like]] [[H1678|a bear.]] [[H6966|It was raised up]] [[H2298|on one]] [[H7859|of its sides,]] [[H8532|and it had three]] [[H5967|ribs]] [[H6433|in its mouth]] [[H997|between]] [[H8128|its teeth.]] [[H3652|So]] [[H560|it was told,]] [[H6966|‘Get up]] ⟨and⟩ [[H399|gorge]] [[H1321|yourself on flesh!’]] ^0705

[[H870|Next,]] [[H1934|as I]] [[H2370|watched,]] [[H317|another beast]] [[H718|appeared.]] [[H5245|It was like a leopard,]] [[H5922|and on]] [[H1355|its back]] [[H703|it had  four]] [[H1611|wings]] [[H1768|like those of]] [[H5776|a bird.]] [[H2423|The beast also]] [[H703|had four]] [[H7217|heads,]] [[H3052|and it was given]] [[H7985|authority to rule.]] ^0706

[[H870|After]] [[H1836|this,]] [[H1934|as I]] [[H2370|watched]] [[H2376|in my vision]] [[H3916|in the night,]] [[H718|suddenly]] [[H7244|a fourth]] [[H2423|beast]] ⟨appeared⟩, ⟨and it was⟩ [[H1763|terrifying—]] [[H574|dreadful]] [[H3493|and extremely]] [[H8624|strong—]] [[H7260|with  large]] [[H6523|iron]] [[H8128|teeth.]] [[H399|It devoured]] [[H1855|and crushed;]] [[H7512|then it trampled]] [[H7271|underfoot]] [[H7606|whatever was left.]] [[H8133|It was different]] [[H4481|from]] [[H3606|all]] [[H2423|the beasts]] [[H6925|before it,]] [[H6236|and it had ten]] [[H7162|horns.]] ^0707

[[H1934|While I was]] [[H7920|contemplating]] [[H7162|the horns,]] [[H317|suddenly another]] [[H7162|horn,]] [[H2192|a little one,]] [[H5559|came up]] [[H997|among them,]] [[H8532|and three]] [[H4481|of]] [[H6933|the first]] [[H7162|horns]] [[H6132|were uprooted]] [[H4481|before]] [[H6925|it.]] [[H1668|This]] [[H7162|horn]] [[H5870|had eyes]] [[H5870|like those]] [[H606|of a man]] [[H6433|and a mouth]] [[H4449|that spoke]] [[H7260|words of arrogance.]] ^0708

[[H5705|As]] [[H1934|I continued]] [[H2370|to watch:]] [[H3764|Thrones]] [[H7412|were set in place,]] [[H6268|and the Ancient]] [[H3118|of Days]] [[H3488|took His seat.]] [[H3831|His clothing]] [[H2358|was white]] [[H8517|as snow,]] [[H8177|and the hair]] [[H7217|of His head]] [[H5343|like pure]] [[H6015|wool.]] [[H3764|His throne]] [[H7631|was flaming]] [[H5135|with fire,]] [[H1535|and its wheels]] [[H1815|were all ablaze.]] ^0709

[[H5103|A river]] [[H1768|of]] [[H5135|fire]] [[H5047|was flowing,]] [[H5312|coming out]] [[H4481|from His presence.]] [[H506|Thousands]] [[H8120|upon thousands  attended Him,]] [[H7240|and myriads]] [[H7240|upon myriads]] [[H6966|stood]] [[H6925|before Him.]] [[H1780|The court]] [[H3488|was convened,]] [[H5609|and the books]] [[H6606|were opened.]] ^0710

[[H116|Then]] [[H2370|I kept watching]] [[H4481|because of]] [[H7260|the arrogant]] [[H4406|words]] [[H7162|the horn]] [[H4449|was speaking.]] [[H5705|As]] [[H1934|I continued]] [[H2370|to watch,]] [[H2423|the beast]] [[H6992|was slain,]] [[H1655|and its body]] [[H7|was destroyed]] [[H3052|and thrown into]] [[H3346|the blazing]] [[H785|fire.]] ^0711

[[H7606|As for the rest]] [[H2423|of the beasts,]] [[H7985|their dominion]] [[H5709|was removed,]] [[H3052|but they were granted]] [[H754|an extension]] [[H2417|of life]] [[H5705|for]] [[H2166|a season]] [[H5732|of time.]] ^0712

[[H2376|In my vision]] [[H3916|in the night]] [[H1934|I continued]] [[H2370|to watch:]] [[H718|And I saw]] [[H1247|One like a Son]] [[H606|of Man]] [[H858|coming]] [[H5974|with]] [[H6050|the clouds]] [[H8065|of heaven.]] [[H4291|He approached]] [[H6268|the Ancient]] [[H3118|of Days]] [[H7127|and was led]] [[H6925|into His presence.]] ^0713

[[H3052|And  He was given]] [[H7985|dominion,]] [[H3367|glory,]] [[H4437|and kingship,]] [[H3606|so that every]] [[H5972|people,]] [[H524|nation,]] [[H3961|and language]] [[H6399|should serve Him.]] [[H7985|His dominion]] [[H5957|is an everlasting]] [[H7985|dominion]] [[H1768|that]] [[H3809|will not]] [[H5709|pass away,]] [[H4437|and His kingdom is one]] [[H1768|that]] [[H3809|will never]] [[H2255|be destroyed.]] ^0714

[[H576|I,]] [[H1841|Daniel,]] [[H3735|was grieved]] [[H1459|in]] [[H7308|my spirit,]] [[H2376|and the visions]] [[H7217|in my mind]] [[H927|alarmed me.]] ^0715

[[H7127|I approached]] [[H2298|one]] [[H4481|of]] [[H6966|those who stood by,]] [[H1156|and I asked]] [[H4481|him]] [[H3330|the true meaning]] [[H5922|of]] [[H3606|all]] [[H1836|this.]] [[H560|So he told]] [[H6591|me  the interpretation]] [[H4406|of these things:]] ^0716

[[H459|‘These]] [[H703|four]] [[H7260|great]] [[H2423|beasts]] [[H581|are]] [[H703|four]] [[H4430|kings]] ⟨who⟩ [[H6966|will arise]] [[H4481|from]] [[H772|the earth.]] ^0717

[[H6922|But the saints]] [[H5946|of the Most High]] [[H6902|will receive]] [[H4437|the kingdom]] [[H2631|and possess]] [[H4437|it]] [[H5705|forever—]] [[H5705|yes, forever]] [[H5957|and ever.’]] ^0718

[[H116|Then]] [[H6634|I wanted]] [[H3321|to know the true meaning]] [[H5922|of]] [[H7244|the fourth]] [[H2423|beast,]] [[H1768|which]] [[H1934|was]] [[H8133|different]] [[H4481|from]] [[H3605|all the —]] ⟨others⟩ [[H3493|extremely]] [[H1763|terrifying—]] [[H6523|with iron]] [[H8128|teeth]] [[H5174|and bronze]] [[H2953|claws,]] [[H399|devouring,]] [[H1855|crushing,]] [[H7512|and trampling]] [[H7271|underfoot]] [[H7606|whatever was left.]] ^0719

[[H5922|I also wanted to know about]] [[H6236|the ten]] [[H7162|horns]] [[H7217|on its head]] [[H317|and the other]] [[H1768|horn that]] [[H5559|came up,]] [[H6925|before which]] [[H8532|three of them]] [[H5308|fell—]] [[H7162|the horn]] [[H2376|whose appearance]] ⟨was⟩ [[H4481|more imposing than]] [[H2273|the others,]] [[H5870|with eyes]] [[H6433|and with  a mouth]] [[H4449|that spoke]] [[H7260|words of arrogance.]] ^0720

[[H1934|As I]] [[H2370|watched,]] [[H1797|this]] [[H7162|horn]] [[H5648|was waging]] [[H7129|war]] [[H5974|against]] [[H6922|the saints]] [[H3202|and prevailing]] ^0721

[[H5705|until]] [[H6268|the Ancient]] [[H3118|of Days]] [[H858|arrived]] [[H3052|and pronounced]] [[H1780|judgment]] [[H6922|in favor of the saints]] [[H5946|of the Most High,]] [[H2166|and the time]] [[H4291|came]] [[H6922|for]] ⟨them⟩ [[H2631|to possess]] [[H4437|the kingdom.]] ^0722

[[H3652|This is what]] [[H560|he said:]] [[H7244|‘The fourth]] [[H2423|beast is]] [[H7244|a fourth]] [[H4437|kingdom]] [[H1934|that will appear]] [[H772|on the earth,]] [[H8133|different]] [[H4481|from]] [[H3606|all]] [[H4437|the other kingdoms,]] [[H399|and it will devour]] [[H3606|the whole]] [[H772|earth,]] [[H1759|trample it down,]] [[H1855|and crush it.]] ^0723

[[H6236|And the ten]] [[H7162|horns]] ⟨are⟩ [[H6236|ten]] [[H4430|kings]] [[H6966|who will rise]] [[H4481|from]] [[H4437|this kingdom.]] [[H311|After them]] [[H321|another]] ⟨king⟩, [[H8133|different]] [[H4481|from]] [[H6933|the earlier]] ⟨ones⟩, [[H6966|will rise]] [[H8214|and subdue]] [[H8532|three]] [[H4430|kings.]] ^0724

[[H4449|He will speak out]] [[H6655|against]] [[H5943|the Most High]] [[H1080|and oppress]] [[H6922|the saints]] [[H5946|of the Most High,]] [[H5452|intending]] [[H8133|to change]] [[H2166|the set times]] [[H1882|and laws,]] [[H3052|and will be given]] ⟨the saints⟩ [[H3028|into his hand]] [[H5705|for]] [[H5732|a time,]] [[H5732|and times,]] [[H6387|and half]] [[H5732|a time.]] ^0725

[[H1780|But the court]] [[H3488|will convene,]] [[H7985|and his dominion]] [[H5709|will be taken away]] [[H8046|and completely destroyed]] [[H5705|forever.]] ^0726

[[H4437|Then the sovereignty,]] [[H7985|dominion,]] [[H7238|and greatness]] [[H1768|of]] [[H4437|the kingdoms]] [[H8460|under]] [[H3606|all]] [[H8065|of heaven]] [[H3052|will be given]] [[H5972|to the people,]] [[H6922|the saints]] [[H5946|of the Most High.]] [[H4437|His kingdom]] [[H5957|will be an everlasting]] [[H4437|kingdom,]] [[H3606|and all]] [[H7985|rulers]] [[H6399|will serve]] [[H8086|and obey Him.’]] ^0727

[[H3542|Thus]] [[H5491|ends]] [[H4406|the matter.]] [[H576|As for me,]] [[H1841|Daniel,]] [[H7476|my thoughts]] [[H927|troubled me]] [[H7690|greatly,]] [[H2122|and my face]] [[H8133|turned pale.]] [[H5202|But I kept]] [[H4406|the matter]] [[H3821|to myself.”]] ^0728

[[H7969|In the third]] [[H8141|year]] [[H4438|of the reign]] [[H4428|of King]] [[H1112|Belshazzar,]] [[H2377|a vision]] [[H7200|appeared]] [[H413|to me,]] [[H1840|Daniel,]] [[H310|subsequent]] [[H7200|to the one that had appeared]] [[H413|to me]] [[H8462|previously.]] ^0801

[[H2377|And in the vision]] [[H7200|I saw]] [[H589|myself]] [[H1002|in the citadel]] [[H7800|of Susa,]] [[H4082|in the province]] [[H5867|of Elam.]] [[H7200|I saw]] [[H2377|in the vision]] [[H589|that I]] [[H1961|was]] [[H5921|beside]] [[H195|the Ulai]] [[H180|Canal.]] ^0802

[[H5375|Then I lifted]] [[H5869|my eyes]] [[H7200|and saw]] [[H352|a ram]] [[H7161|with  two horns]] [[H5975|standing]] [[H6440|beside]] [[H180|the canal.]] [[H7161|The horns]] [[H1364|were long,]] [[H259|but one]] [[H1364|was longer]] [[H4480|than]] [[H8145|the other,]] [[H1364|and the longer]] [[H5927|one grew up]] [[H314|later.]] ^0803

[[H7200|I saw]] [[H352|the ram]] [[H5055|charging]] [[H3220|toward the west]] [[H6828|and the north]] [[H5045|and the south.]] [[H3605|No]] [[H2416|animal]] [[H5975|could stand]] [[H6440|against him,]] [[H369|and there was no]] [[H5337|deliverance]] [[H3027|from his power.]] [[H6213|He did]] [[H7522|as he pleased]] [[H1431|and became great.]] ^0804

[[H589|As I]] [[H1961|was]] [[H995|contemplating all this,]] [[H2009|suddenly]] [[H6842|a goat]] [[H2380|with a prominent]] [[H7161|horn]] [[H996|between]] [[H5869|his eyes]] [[H935|came]] [[H4480|out of]] [[H4628|the west,]] [[H5921|crossing]] [[H6440|the surface]] [[H3605|of the entire]] [[H776|earth]] [[H369|without]] [[H5060|touching]] [[H776|the ground.]] ^0805

[[H935|He came]] [[H5704|toward]] [[H7161|the two-horned]] [[H352|ram]] [[H7200|I had seen]] [[H5975|standing]] [[H6440|beside]] [[H180|the canal]] [[H7323|and rushed]] [[H413|at him]] [[H2534|with furious]] [[H3581|power.]] ^0806

[[H7200|I saw]] [[H5060|him approach]] [[H352|the ram]] [[H4843|in a rage]] [[H413|against him,]] [[H5221|and he struck]] [[H352|the ram]] [[H7665|and shattered]] [[H8147|his two]] [[H7161|horns.]] [[H352|The ram]] [[H1961|was]] [[H3581|powerless]] [[H5975|to stand]] [[H6440|against him,]] [[H7993|and the goat threw]] [[H776|him to the ground]] [[H7429|and trampled him,]] ⟨and⟩ [[H1961|]] [[H3808|no one]] [[H5337|could deliver]] [[H352|the ram]] [[H3027|from his power.]] ^0807

[[H6842|Thus the goat]] [[H5704|became]] [[H3966|very]] [[H1431|great,]] [[H6105|but at the height of his power,]] [[H1419|his large]] [[H7161|horn]] [[H7665|was broken off,]] [[H702|and four]] [[H2380|prominent]] [[H5927|horns came up]] [[H8478|in its place,]] [[H702|pointing toward the four]] [[H7307|winds]] [[H8064|of heaven.]] ^0808

[[H4480|From]] [[H259|one]] [[H1992|of]] ⟨these horns⟩ [[H259|a]] [[H4704|little]] [[H7161|horn]] [[H3318|emerged]] [[H1431|and grew]] [[H3499|extensively]] [[H413|toward]] [[H5045|the south]] [[H4217|and the east]] [[H413|and toward]] [[H6643|the Beautiful Land.]] ^0809

[[H1431|It grew as high]] [[H5704|as]] [[H6635|the host]] [[H8064|of heaven,]] [[H5307|and it cast down]] [[H4480|some of]] [[H6635|the host]] [[H4480|and]] ⟨some⟩ [[H3556|of the stars]] [[H776|to the earth,]] [[H7429|and trampled them.]] ^0810

[[H1431|It magnified itself,]] [[H5704|even to]] [[H8269|the Prince]] [[H6635|of the host;]] [[H7311|it removed]] [[H8548|His daily sacrifice]] [[H7993|and overthrew]] [[H4349|the place]] [[H4720|of His sanctuary.]] ^0811

[[H6588|And on account of rebellion,]] [[H6635|the host]] ⟨and⟩ [[H5921|]] [[H8548|the daily sacrifice]] [[H5414|were given over]] ⟨to the horn⟩, [[H7993|and it flung]] [[H571|truth]] [[H776|to the ground]] [[H6743|and prospered]] [[H6213|in whatever it did.]] ^0812

[[H8085|Then I heard]] [[H259|a]] [[H6918|holy one]] [[H1696|speaking,]] [[H259|and another]] [[H6918|holy]] [[H559|one said]] [[H1696|to]] ⟨him⟩, [[H5704|“How]] [[H4970|long]] ⟨until the fulfillment of⟩ [[H2377|the vision]] [[H8548|of the daily sacrifice,]] [[H6588|the rebellion]] [[H8074|that causes desolation,]] [[H5414|and the surrender]] [[H6944|of the sanctuary]] [[H6635|and of the host]] [[H4823|to be trampled?”]] ^0813

[[H559|He said]] [[H413|to me,]] [[H5704|“It will take]] [[H505|2,300]] [[H6153|evenings]] [[H1242|and mornings;]] [[H6944|then the sanctuary]] [[H6663|will be properly restored.”]] ^0814

[[H589|While I,]] [[H1840|Daniel,]] [[H7200|was watching]] [[H2377|the vision]] [[H1245|and trying to]] [[H998|understand it,]] [[H2009|there]] [[H5975|stood]] [[H5048|before me]] [[H4758|one having the appearance]] [[H1397|of a man.]] ^0815

[[H8085|And I heard]] [[H6963|the voice]] [[H120|of a man]] [[H7121|calling]] [[H996|from between]] ⟨the banks of⟩ [[H195|the Ulai:]] [[H1403|“Gabriel,]] [[H995|explain]] [[H4758|the vision]] [[H1975|to this man.”]] ^0816

[[H935|As he came]] [[H681|near]] [[H5975|to where I stood,]] [[H1204|I was terrified]] [[H5307|and fell]] [[H5921|facedown.]] [[H1121|“Son]] [[H120|of man,”]] [[H559|he said]] [[H413|to me,]] [[H995|“understand]] [[H3588|that]] [[H2377|the vision]] [[H6256|concerns the time]] [[H7093|of the end.”]] ^0817

[[H1696|While he was speaking]] [[H5973|to me,]] [[H7290|I fell into a deep sleep,]] [[H5921|with]] [[H6440|my face]] [[H776|to the ground.]] [[H5060|Then he touched me,]] [[H5975|helped me to my feet]] ^0818

[[H589|I,]] [[H1840|Daniel,]] [[H1961|was exhausted]] [[H2470|and lay ill]] [[H3117|for days.]] [[H6965|Then I got up]] [[H6213|and went about]] [[H4428|the king’s]] [[H4399|business.]] [[H8074|I was devastated]] [[H5921|by]] [[H4758|the vision;]] [[H369|it was beyond]] [[H995|understanding.]] ^0827

[[H8085|I heard]] [[H6963|the sound]] [[H1697|of his words,]] [[H8085|and as I listened,]] [[H589|I]] [[H7290|fell into a deep sleep,]] [[H6440|with my face]] [[H776|to the ground.]] ^1009

[[H2009|And suddenly]] ⟨one⟩ [[H1823|with the likeness]] [[H120|of a man]] [[H5060|touched]] [[H8193|my lips,]] [[H6605|and I opened]] [[H6310|my mouth]] [[H559|and said]] [[H413|to]] [[H5975|the one standing]] [[H5048|before me,]] [[H113|“My lord,]] [[H4759|because of the vision,]] [[H2015|I am overcome]] [[H6735|with anguish,]] [[H6113|and I have]] [[H3808|no]] [[H3581|strength.]] ^1016

[[H1963|How]] [[H3201|can I,]] ⟨your⟩ [[H113|]] [[H5650|servant,]] [[H1696|speak]] [[H5973|with]] ⟨you⟩ [[H2088|,]] [[H113|my lord?]] [[H6258|Now]] [[H589|I]] [[H5975|have]] [[H3808|no]] [[H3581|strength,]] [[H3808|nor]] [[H5397|is any breath]] [[H7604|left]] ^1017

[[H3254|Again]] ⟨the one⟩ [[H4758|with the likeness]] [[H120|of a man]] [[H5060|touched]] [[H2388|me  and strengthened me.]] ^1018

[[H408|“Do not]] [[H3372|be afraid,]] [[H2530|you who are highly precious,”]] [[H559|he said.]] [[H7965|“Peace]] ⟨be⟩ [[H2388|with you!  Be strong now,]] [[H2388|be very strong!”]] [[H1696|As he spoke]] [[H5973|to me,]] [[H2388|I was strengthened]] [[H559|and said,]] [[H113|“May my lord]] [[H1696|speak,]] [[H3588|for]] [[H2388|you have strengthened me.”]] ^1019

[[H3045|“Do you know]] [[H4100|why]] [[H935|I have come]] [[H413|to you?”]] [[H559|he said.]] [[H7725|“I must return]] [[H6258|at once]] [[H3898|to fight]] [[H5973|against]] [[H8269|the prince]] [[H6539|of Persia,]] [[H589|and when I]] [[H3318|have gone forth,]] [[H2009|behold,]] [[H8269|the prince]] [[H3120|of Greece]] [[H935|will come.]] ^1020

[[H61|But first]] [[H5046|I will tell]] [[H7559|you  what is inscribed]] [[H3791|in the book]] [[H571|of truth.]] [[H369|Yet no]] [[H259|one]] [[H2388|has the courage]] [[H5973|to support me]] [[H5921|against]] [[H428|these,]] [[H3588|except]] [[H4317|Michael,]] [[H8269|your prince.]] ^1021

[[H589|And I,]] [[H259|in the first]] [[H8141|year]] [[H1867|of Darius]] [[H4075|the Mede,]] [[H5975|stood up]] [[H2388|to strengthen]] [[H4581|and protect]] ^1101

[[H6258|Now then,]] [[H5046|I will tell]] [[H571|you the truth:]] [[H7969|Three]] [[H5750|more]] [[H4428|kings]] [[H5975|will arise]] [[H6539|in Persia,]] [[H7243|and then a fourth,]] [[H6239|who will be]] [[H1419|far]] [[H6238|richer]] ⟨than the others⟩. [[H2393|By the power]] [[H6239|of his wealth,]] [[H5782|he will stir up]] [[H3605|everyone]] [[H4438|against the kingdom]] [[H3120|of Greece.]] ^1102

[[H1368|Then a mighty]] [[H4428|king]] [[H5975|will arise,]] [[H4910|who will rule]] [[H7227|with great]] [[H4474|authority]] [[H6213|and do]] [[H7522|as he pleases.]] ^1103

[[H5975|But as soon as he is established,]] [[H4438|his kingdom]] [[H7665|will be broken up]] [[H2673|and parceled]] [[H702|out toward the four]] [[H7307|winds]] [[H8064|of heaven.]] [[H3808|It will not]] ⟨go⟩ [[H319|to his descendants,]] [[H3808|nor will it]] [[H4915|have the authority]] [[H834|with which]] [[H4910|he ruled,]] [[H3588|because]] [[H4438|his kingdom]] [[H5428|will be uprooted]] [[H312|and to others.]] ⟨given⟩ ^1104

[[H4428|The king]] [[H5045|of the South]] [[H2388|will grow strong,]] [[H4480|but one of]] [[H8269|his commanders]] [[H5921|will grow even]] [[H2388|stronger]] [[H4910|and will rule]] [[H4474|his own kingdom]] [[H7227|with great]] [[H4475|authority.]] ^1105

[[H7093|After]] [[H8141|some years]] [[H2266|they will form an alliance,]] [[H1323|and the daughter]] [[H4428|of the king]] [[H5045|of the South]] [[H935|will go]] [[H413|to]] [[H4428|the king]] [[H6828|of the North]] [[H6213|to seal]] [[H4339|the agreement.]] [[H3808|But will not]] ⟨his daughter⟩ [[H6113|retain]] [[H3581|her position of power,]] [[H3808|nor will]] [[H2220|his strength]] [[H5975|endure.]] [[H6256|At that time]] [[H1931|she]] [[H5414|will be given up,]] [[H935|along with her royal escort]] [[H3205|and her father]] [[H2388|and the one who supported her.]] ^1106

[[H5342|But one from her family line]] [[H5975|will rise up]] [[H3653|in his place,]] [[H935|come]] [[H413|against]] [[H2428|the army]] [[H4428|of the king]] [[H6828|of the North,]] [[H935|and enter]] [[H4581|his fortress,]] [[H6213|fighting]] [[H2388|and prevailing.]] ^1107

[[H935|He will take]] [[H1571|even]] [[H430|their gods]] [[H7628|captive]] [[H4714|to Egypt,]] [[H5973|with]] [[H5257|their metal images]] [[H2532|and their precious]] [[H3627|vessels]] [[H3701|of silver]] [[H2091|and gold.]] [[H8141|For some years]] [[H1931|he]] [[H5975|will stay away]] [[H4428|from the king]] [[H6828|of the North,]] ^1108

[[H935|who will invade]] [[H4438|the realm]] [[H4428|of the king]] [[H5045|of the South]] [[H7725|and then return]] [[H413|to]] [[H127|his own land.]] ^1109

[[H1121|But his sons]] [[H1624|will stir up strife]] [[H622|and assemble]] [[H7227|a great]] [[H1995|army,]] [[H935|which will advance forcefully,]] [[H5674|sweeping through]] [[H7857|like a flood,]] [[H7725|and will again]] [[H1624|carry the battle]] [[H5704|as]] [[H4581|far as his fortress.]] ^1110

[[H4843|In a rage,]] [[H4428|the king]] [[H5045|of the South]] [[H3318|will march out]] [[H3898|to fight]] [[H4428|the king]] [[H6828|of the North,]] [[H5975|who will raise]] [[H7227|a large]] [[H1995|army,]] [[H1995|but it]] [[H5414|will be given over]] [[H3027|to the hand of his]] ⟨enemy⟩. ^1111

[[H1995|When the army]] [[H5375|is carried off,]] ⟨the king of the South⟩ [[H7311|will be proud]] [[H3824|in heart]] [[H5307|and cast down]] [[H7239|tens of thousands,]] [[H3808|but he will not]] [[H5810|triumph.]] ^1112

[[H4428|For the king]] [[H6828|of the North]] [[H5975|will raise]] [[H7725|another]] [[H1995|army,]] [[H7227|larger]] [[H4480|than]] [[H7223|the first,]] [[H7093|and after]] [[H8141|some years]] [[H935|he will advance]] [[H1419|with a great]] [[H2428|army]] [[H7227|and many]] [[H7399|supplies.]] ^1113

[[H1992|In those]] [[H6256|times]] [[H7227|many]] [[H5975|will rise up]] [[H5921|against]] [[H4428|the king]] [[H5045|of the South.]] [[H6530|Violent]] [[H1121|ones]] [[H5971|among your own people]] [[H5375|will exalt themselves]] [[H5975|in fulfillment]] [[H2377|of the vision,]] [[H3782|but they will fail.]] ^1114

[[H4428|Then the king]] [[H6828|of the North]] [[H935|will come,]] [[H8210|build up]] [[H5550|a siege mound,]] [[H3920|and capture]] [[H4013|a fortified]] [[H5892|city.]] [[H2220|The forces]] [[H5045|of the South]] [[H3808|will not]] [[H5975|stand;]] [[H4005|even their best]] [[H5971|troops]] [[H369|will not]] [[H3581|be able]] [[H5975|to resist.]] ^1115

[[H935|The invader]] [[H6213|will do]] [[H7522|as he pleases,]] [[H369|and no one]] [[H5975|will stand]] [[H6440|against him.]] [[H5975|He will establish]] [[H6643|himself in the Beautiful]] [[H776|Land,]] [[H3615|with destruction]] [[H3027|in his hand.]] ^1116

[[H7760|He will resolve]] [[H935|to come]] [[H8633|with the strength]] [[H3605|of his whole]] [[H4438|kingdom,]] [[H3477|and will reach an agreement]] [[H5973|with]] ⟨the king of the South⟩. [[H1323|He will give him a daughter]] [[H802|in marriage]] [[H7843|in order to overthrow]] ⟨the kingdom⟩, [[H3808|but will not]] ⟨his plan⟩ [[H5975|succeed]] [[H3808|or help him.]] ^1117

[[H7725|Then he will turn]] [[H6440|his face]] [[H339|to the coastlands]] [[H3920|and capture]] [[H7227|many of them.]] [[H7101|But a commander]] [[H7673|will put an end]] [[H2781|to his reproach]] [[H7725|and will turn it back]] ^1118

[[H6440|After this, he will turn back]] [[H7725|his face]] [[H4581|to the fortresses]] [[H776|of his own land,]] [[H3782|but he will stumble]] [[H5307|and fall]] [[H3808|and be no more.]] ^1119

[[H5921|In]] [[H3653|his place]] [[H5975|one will arise]] [[H5674|who will send out]] [[H5065|a tax collector]] [[H1925|for the glory]] [[H4438|of the kingdom;]] [[H259|but within a few]] [[H3117|days]] [[H7665|he will be destroyed,]] [[H3808|though not]] [[H639|in anger]] [[H4421|or in battle.]] ^1120

[[H5921|In]] [[H3653|his place]] [[H959|a despicable person]] [[H5975|will arise;]] [[H4438|royal]] [[H1935|honors]] [[H3808|will not]] [[H5414|be given]] [[H5921|to him,]] [[H935|but he will come]] [[H7962|in a time of peace]] [[H2388|and seize]] [[H4438|the kingdom]] [[H2519|by intrigue.]] ^1121

[[H7858|Then a flood]] [[H2220|of forces]] [[H7857|will be swept away]] [[H6440|before him]] [[H7665|and destroyed,]] [[H1571|along with]] [[H5057|a prince]] [[H1285|of the covenant.]] ^1122

[[H4480|After]] [[H2266|an alliance is made]] [[H413|with him,]] [[H6213|he will act]] [[H4820|deceitfully;]] [[H5927|for he will rise]] [[H6105|to power]] [[H4592|with only a few]] [[H1471|people.]] ^1123

[[H7962|In a time of peace,]] [[H935|he will invade]] [[H4924|the richest]] [[H4082|provinces]] [[H6213|and do]] [[H834|what]] [[H1|his fathers]] [[H1|and forefathers]] [[H3808|never]] [[H6213|did.]] [[H967|He will lavish]] ⟨on his followers⟩ [[H961|plunder,]] [[H7998|loot,]] [[H7399|and wealth,]] [[H2803|and he will plot]] [[H5921|against]] [[H4013|the strongholds—]] [[H5704|but only for]] [[H6256|a time.]] ^1124

[[H1419|And with a large]] [[H2428|army]] [[H5782|he will stir up]] [[H3581|his power]] [[H3824|and his courage]] [[H5921|against]] [[H4428|the king]] [[H5045|of the South,]] ⟨who⟩ [[H4428|]] [[H1624|will mobilize]] [[H5704|a very]] [[H1419|large]] [[H6099|and powerful]] [[H2428|army]] [[H3808|but will not]] [[H5975|withstand]] [[H4284|the plots]] [[H2803|devised]] [[H5921|against him.]] ^1125

[[H398|Those who eat]] [[H6598|from  his provisions]] [[H7665|will seek to destroy him;]] [[H2428|his army]] [[H7857|will be swept away,]] [[H7227|and many]] [[H5307|will fall]] [[H2491|slain.]] ^1126

[[H8147|And the two]] [[H4428|kings,]] [[H3824|with their hearts]] [[H4827|bent on evil,]] [[H1696|will speak]] [[H3577|lies]] [[H5921|at]] [[H259|the same]] [[H7979|table,]] [[H3808|but to no]] [[H6743|avail,]] [[H3588|for]] [[H5750|still]] [[H7093|the end]] [[H4150|will come at the appointed time.]] ^1127

[[H7725|The king of the North will return]] [[H776|to his land]] [[H1419|with great]] [[H7399|wealth,]] [[H3824|but his heart]] [[H5921|will be set against]] [[H6944|the holy]] [[H1285|covenant;]] [[H6213|so he will do]] ⟨damage⟩ [[H7725|and return]] [[H776|to his own land.]] ^1128

[[H4150|At the appointed time]] [[H935|he will invade]] [[H5045|the South]] [[H7725|again,]] [[H3808|but this time will not]] [[H1961|be]] [[H7223|like the first.]] ^1129

[[H6716|Ships]] [[H3794|of Kittim]] [[H935|will come]] [[H3512|against him,  and he will lose heart.]] [[H7725|Then he will turn back]] [[H2194|and rage]] [[H5921|against]] [[H6944|the holy]] [[H1285|covenant]] [[H6213|and do]] ⟨damage⟩. [[H7725|So he will return]] [[H995|and show favor]] [[H5921|to]] [[H5800|those who forsake]] [[H6944|the holy]] [[H1285|covenant.]] ^1130

[[H4480|His]] [[H2220|forces]] [[H5975|will rise up]] [[H2490|and desecrate]] [[H4720|the temple]] [[H4581|fortress.]] [[H5493|They will abolish]] [[H8548|the daily sacrifice]] [[H5414|and set up]] [[H8251|the abomination]] [[H8074|of desolation.]] ^1131

[[H2514|With flattery]] [[H2610|he will corrupt]] [[H7561|those who violate]] [[H1285|the covenant,]] [[H5971|but the people]] [[H3045|who know]] [[H430|their God]] [[H2388|will firmly]] [[H6213|resist]] ⟨him⟩. ^1132

[[H7919|Those with insight]] [[H995|will instruct]] [[H7227|many,]] [[H3117|though for a time]] [[H3782|they will fall]] [[H2719|by sword]] [[H3852|and flame]] [[H7628|or be captured]] [[H961|or plundered.]] ^1133

[[H3782|Now when they fall,]] [[H5826|they will be granted]] [[H4592|a little]] [[H5828|help,]] [[H7227|but many]] [[H3867|will join]] [[H5921|them]] [[H2519|insincerely.]] ^1134

[[H4480|Some of]] [[H7919|the wise]] [[H3782|will fall,]] [[H6884|so that they may be refined,]] [[H1305|purified,]] [[H3835|and made spotless]] [[H5704|until]] [[H6256|the time]] [[H7093|of the end,]] [[H3588|for]] [[H5750|it will still]] [[H4150|come at the appointed time.]] ^1135

[[H4428|Then the king]] [[H6213|will do]] [[H7522|as he pleases]] [[H7311|and will exalt]] [[H1431|and magnify]] [[H5921|himself above]] [[H3605|every]] [[H410|god,]] [[H1696|and he will speak]] [[H6381|monstrous things]] [[H5921|against]] [[H410|the God]] [[H410|of gods.]] [[H6743|He will be successful]] [[H5704|until]] [[H2195|the time of wrath]] [[H3615|is completed,]] [[H3588|for]] [[H2782|what has been decreed]] [[H6213|must be accomplished.]] ^1136

[[H995|He will show no regard]] [[H5921|for]] [[H430|the gods]] [[H1|of his fathers,]] [[H2532|nor for the one desired]] [[H802|by women,]] [[H5921|nor for]] [[H3605|any]] [[H433|other god,]] [[H3588|because]] [[H1431|he will magnify]] [[H5921|himself above]] ⟨them⟩ [[H3605|all.]] ^1137

[[H5921|And in]] [[H3653|their place,]] [[H3513|he will honor]] [[H433|a god]] [[H4581|of fortresses—]] [[H433|a god]] [[H1|his fathers]] [[H3808|did not]] [[H3045|know—]] [[H2091|with gold,]] [[H3701|silver,]] [[H3368|precious]] [[H68|stones,]] [[H2530|and riches.]] ^1138

[[H6213|He will attack]] [[H4013|the strongest fortresses]] [[H5973|with]] [[H5236|the help of a foreign]] [[H433|god]] [[H7235|and will greatly]] [[H3519|honor]] [[H834|those who]] [[H5234|acknowledge him,]] [[H4910|making them rulers]] [[H7227|over many]] [[H2505|and distributing]] [[H127|land]] [[H4242|for a price.]] ^1139

[[H6256|At the time]] [[H7093|of the end,]] [[H4428|the king]] [[H5045|of the South]] [[H5055|will engage him in battle,]] [[H4428|but the king]] [[H6828|of the North]] [[H8175|will storm out]] [[H5921|against him]] [[H7393|with chariots,]] [[H6571|horsemen,]] [[H7227|and many]] [[H591|ships,]] [[H935|invading]] ⟨many⟩ [[H776|countries]] [[H5674|and sweeping through them]] [[H7857|like a flood.]] ^1140

[[H935|He will also invade]] [[H6643|the Beautiful]] [[H776|Land,]] [[H7227|and many]] ⟨countries⟩ [[H3782|will fall.]] [[H428|But these]] [[H4422|will be delivered]] [[H3027|from his hand:]] [[H123|Edom,]] [[H4124|Moab,]] [[H7225|and the leaders]] [[H1121|of the Ammonites.]] ^1141

[[H7971|He will extend]] [[H3027|his power]] [[H776|over countries,]] ⟨many⟩ [[H3808|and not even]] [[H776|the land]] [[H4714|of Egypt]] [[H6413|will escape.]] ^1142

[[H4910|He will gain control]] [[H4362|of the treasures]] [[H2091|of gold]] [[H3701|and silver]] [[H3605|and over all]] [[H2530|the riches]] [[H4714|of Egypt,]] [[H3864|and the Libyans]] [[H3569|and Cushites]] [[H4703|will also submit to him.]] ^1143

[[H8052|But news]] [[H4217|from the east]] [[H6828|and the north]] [[H926|will alarm him,]] [[H3318|and he will go out]] [[H1419|with great]] [[H2534|fury]] [[H8045|to destroy]] [[H2763|and annihilate]] [[H7227|many.]] ^1144

[[H5193|He will pitch]] [[H643|his royal]] [[H168|tents]] [[H996|between]] [[H3220|the sea]] [[H6643|and the beautiful]] [[H6944|holy]] [[H2022|mountain,]] [[H935|but he will meet]] [[H7093|his end]] [[H369|with no one]] [[H5826|to help]] ^1145

[[H1931|At that]] [[H6256|time]] [[H4317|Michael,]] [[H1419|the great]] [[H8269|prince]] [[H5975|who stands watch]] [[H5921|over]] [[H1121|your people,]] [[H5975|will rise up.]] [[H1961|There will be]] [[H6256|a time]] [[H6869|of distress]] [[H834|such as]] [[H3808|never]] [[H1961|has occurred]] [[H1961|from the beginning]] [[H1471|of nations]] [[H5704|until]] [[H6256|then.]] [[H1931|But at that]] [[H6256|time]] [[H5971|your people]] [[H3605|everyone]] ⟨whose name⟩ [[H4672|is found]] [[H3789|written]] [[H5612|in the book]] [[H4422|will be delivered.]] ^1201

[[H7227|And many]] [[H3463|who sleep]] [[H6083|in the dust]] [[H127|of the earth]] [[H6974|will awake,]] [[H428|some]] [[H5769|to everlasting]] [[H2416|life,]] [[H428|but others]] [[H2781|to shame]] ⟨and⟩ [[H5769|everlasting]] [[H1860|contempt.]] ^1202

[[H7919|Then the wise]] [[H2094|will shine]] [[H2096|like the brightness]] [[H7549|of the heavens,]] [[H7227|and those who lead many]] [[H6663|to righteousness,]] [[H3556|like the stars]] [[H5769|forever]] [[H5703|and ever.]] ^1203

[[H859|But you,]] [[H1840|Daniel,]] [[H5640|shut up]] [[H1697|these words]] [[H2856|and seal]] [[H5612|the book]] [[H5704|until]] [[H6256|the time]] [[H7093|of the end.]] [[H7227|Many]] [[H7751|will roam to and fro,]] [[H1847|and knowledge]] [[H7235|will increase.”]] ^1204

[[H589|Then I,]] [[H1840|Daniel,]] [[H7200|looked]] [[H2009|and saw]] [[H8147|two]] [[H312|others]] [[H5975|standing]] [[H2008|there,]] [[H259|one]] [[H8193|on this bank]] [[H2975|of the river]] [[H259|and one]] [[H2008|on the opposite]] [[H8193|bank.]] ^1205

[[H559|One of them said]] [[H376|to the man]] [[H3847|dressed]] [[H906|in linen,]] [[H834|who]] [[H4605|was above]] [[H4325|the waters]] [[H2975|of the river,]] [[H4970|“How long]] [[H5704|until]] [[H7093|the fulfillment]] [[H6382|of these wonders?”]] ^1206

[[H376|And the man]] [[H3847|dressed]] [[H906|in linen,]] [[H834|who]] [[H4605|was above]] [[H4325|the waters]] [[H2975|of the river,]] [[H7311|raised]] [[H3225|his right hand]] [[H8040|and his left hand]] [[H413|toward]] [[H8064|heaven,]] [[H8085|and I heard]] [[H7650|him swear]] [[H2416|by Him who lives]] [[H5769|forever,]] [[H3588|saying,]] [[H4150|“It will be for a time,]] [[H4150|times,]] [[H2677|and half a time.]] [[H3027|When the power]] [[H6944|of the holy]] [[H5971|people]] [[H5310|has been shattered,]] [[H3605|all]] [[H428|these]] [[H3615|things will be completed.]] ^1207

[[H589|I]] [[H8085|heard,]] [[H3808|but I did not]] [[H995|understand.]] [[H559|So I asked,]] [[H113|“My lord,]] [[H4100|what]] [[H319|will be the outcome]] [[H428|of these?”]] ⟨things⟩ ^1208

[[H1980|“Go on your way,]] [[H1840|Daniel,”]] [[H559|he replied,]] [[H3588|“for]] [[H1697|the words]] ⟨are⟩ [[H5640|closed up]] [[H2856|and sealed]] [[H5704|until]] [[H6256|the time]] [[H7093|of the end.]] ^1209

[[H7227|Many]] [[H1305|will be purified,]] [[H3835|made spotless,]] [[H6884|and refined,]] [[H7563|but the wicked]] [[H7561|will continue to act wickedly.]] [[H3808|None]] [[H7563|of the wicked]] [[H995|will understand,]] [[H7919|but the wise]] [[H995|will understand.]] ^1210

[[H6256|And from the time]] [[H8548|the daily]] ⟨sacrifice⟩ [[H5493|is abolished]] [[H8251|and the abomination]] [[H8074|of desolation]] [[H5414|set up,]] [[H505|there will be 1,290]] [[H3117|days.]] ^1211

[[H835|Blessed]] ⟨is⟩ [[H2442|he who waits]] [[H5060|and reaches the end]] [[H505|of the 1,335]] [[H3117|days.]] ^1212

[[H859|But as for you,]] [[H1980|go on your way]] [[H7093|until the end.]] [[H5117|You will rest,]] [[H5975|and will arise]] [[H1486|to your inheritance]] [[H7093|at the end]] [[H3117|of the days.”]] ^1213
