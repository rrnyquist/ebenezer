After the death of Joshua, the people of Israel inquired of the Lord, Who shall go up first for us against the Canaanites, to fight against them? ^0101

The Lord said, Judah shall go up; behold, I have given the land into his hand. ^0102

And Judah said to Simeon his brother, Come up with me into the territory allotted to me, that we may fight against the Canaanites. And I likewise will go with you into the territory allotted to you. So Simeon went with him. ^0103

Then Judah went up and the Lord gave the Canaanites and the Perizzites into their hand, and they defeated 10,000 of them at Bezek. ^0104

They found Adoni-bezek at Bezek and fought against him and defeated the Canaanites and the Perizzites. ^0105

Adoni-bezek fled, but they pursued him and caught him and cut off his thumbs and his big toes. ^0106

And Adoni-bezek said, Seventy kings with their thumbs and their big toes cut off used to pick up scraps under my table. As I have done, so God has repaid me. And they brought him to Jerusalem, and he died there. ^0107

And the men of Judah fought against Jerusalem and captured it and struck it with the edge of the sword and set the city on fire. ^0108

And afterward the men of Judah went down to fight against the Canaanites who lived in the hill country, in the Negeb, and in the lowland. ^0109

And Judah went against the Canaanites who lived in Hebron (now the name of Hebron was formerly Kiriath-arba ), and they defeated Sheshai and Ahiman and Talmai. ^0110

From there they went against the inhabitants of Debir. The name of Debir was formerly Kiriath-sepher. ^0111

And Caleb said, He who attacks Kiriath-sepher and captures it, I will give him Achsah my daughter for a wife. ^0112

And Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother, captured it. And he gave him Achsah his daughter for a wife. ^0113

When she came to him, she urged him to ask her father for a field. And she dismounted from her donkey, and Caleb said to her, What do you want? ^0114

She said to him, Give me a blessing. Since you have set me in the land of the Negeb, give me also springs of water. And Caleb gave her the upper springs and the lower springs. ^0115

And the descendants of the Kenite, Moses ’ father-in-law, went up with the people of Judah from the city of palms into the wilderness of Judah, which lies in the Negeb near Arad, and they went and settled with the people. ^0116

And Judah went with Simeon his brother, and they defeated the Canaanites who inhabited Zephath and devoted it to destruction. So the name of the city was called Hormah. ^0117

Judah also captured Gaza with its territory, and Ashkelon with its territory, and Ekron with its territory. ^0118

And the Lord was with Judah, and he took possession of the hill country, but he could not drive out the inhabitants of the plain because they had chariots of iron. ^0119

And Hebron was given to Caleb, as Moses had said. And he drove out from it the three sons of Anak. ^0120

But the people of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites who lived in Jerusalem, so the Jebusites have lived with the people of Benjamin in Jerusalem to this day. ^0121

The house of Joseph also went up against Bethel, and the Lord was with them. ^0122

And the house of Joseph scouted out Bethel. ( Now the name of the city was formerly Luz .) ^0123

And the spies saw a man coming out of the city, and they said to him, Please show us the way into the city, and we will deal kindly with you. ^0124

And he showed them the way into the city. And they struck the city with the edge of the sword, but they let the man and all his family go. ^0125

And the man went to the land of the Hittites and built a city and called its name Luz. That is its name to this day. ^0126

Manasseh did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shean and its villages, or Taanach and its villages, or the inhabitants of Dor and its villages, or the inhabitants of Ibleam and its villages, or the inhabitants of Megiddo and its villages, for the Canaanites persisted in dwelling in that land. ^0127

When Israel grew strong, they put the Canaanites to forced labor, but did not drive them out completely. ^0128

And Ephraim did not drive out the Canaanites who lived in Gezer, so the Canaanites lived in Gezer among them. ^0129

Zebulun did not drive out the inhabitants of Kitron, or the inhabitants of Nahalol, so the Canaanites lived among them, but became subject to forced labor. ^0130

Asher did not drive out the inhabitants of Acco, or the inhabitants of Sidon or of Ahlab or of Achzib or of Helbah or of Aphik or of Rehob, ^0131

so the Asherites lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land, for they did not drive them out. ^0132

Naphtali did not drive out the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh, or the inhabitants of Beth-anath, so they lived among the Canaanites, the inhabitants of the land. Nevertheless, the inhabitants of Beth-shemesh and of Beth-anath became subject to forced labor for them. ^0133

The Amorites pressed the people of Dan back into the hill country, for they did not allow them to come down to the plain. ^0134

The Amorites persisted in dwelling in Mount Heres, in Aijalon, and in Shaalbim, but the hand of the house of Joseph rested heavily on them, and they became subject to forced labor. ^0135

And the border of the Amorites ran from the ascent of Akrabbim, from Sela and upward. ^0136



Now the angel of the Lord went up from Gilgal to Bochim. And he said, I brought you up from Egypt and brought you into the land that I swore to give to your fathers. I said, I will never break my covenant with you, ^0201

and you shall make no covenant with the inhabitants of this land; you shall break down their altars. But you have not obeyed my voice. What is this you have done? ^0202

So now I say, I will not drive them out before you, but they shall become thorns in your sides, and their gods shall be a snare to you. ^0203

As soon as the angel of the Lord spoke these words to all the people of Israel, the people lifted up their voices and wept. ^0204

And they called the name of that place Bochim. And they sacrificed there to the Lord. ^0205

When Joshua dismissed the people, the people of Israel went each to his inheritance to take possession of the land. ^0206

And the people served the Lord all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great work that the Lord had done for Israel. ^0207

And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the Lord, died at the age of 110 years. ^0208

And they buried him within the boundaries of his inheritance in Timnath-heres, in the hill country of Ephraim, north of the mountain of Gaash. ^0209

And all that generation also were gathered to their fathers. And there arose another generation after them who did not know the Lord or the work that he had done for Israel. ^0210

And the people of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the Lord and served the Baals. ^0211

And they abandoned the Lord, the God of their fathers, who had brought them out of the land of Egypt. They went after other gods, from among the gods of the peoples who were around them, and bowed down to them. And they provoked the Lord to anger. ^0212

They abandoned the Lord and served the Baals and the Ashtaroth. ^0213

So the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and he gave them over to plunderers, who plundered them. And he sold them into the hand of their surrounding enemies, so that they could no longer withstand their enemies. ^0214

Whenever they marched out, the hand of the Lord was against them for harm, as the Lord had warned, and as the Lord had sworn to them. And they were in terrible distress. ^0215

Then the Lord raised up judges, who saved them out of the hand of those who plundered them. ^0216

Yet they did not listen to their judges, for they whored after other gods and bowed down to them. They soon turned aside from the way in which their fathers had walked, who had obeyed the commandments of the Lord, and they did not do so. ^0217

Whenever the Lord raised up judges for them, the Lord was with the judge, and he saved them from the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge. For the Lord was moved to pity by their groaning because of those who afflicted and oppressed them. ^0218

But whenever the judge died, they turned back and were more corrupt than their fathers, going after other gods, serving them and bowing down to them. They did not drop any of their practices or their stubborn ways. ^0219

So the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and he said, Because this people have transgressed my covenant that I commanded their fathers and have not obeyed my voice, ^0220

I will no longer drive out before them any of the nations that Joshua left when he died, ^0221

in order to test Israel by them, whether they will take care to walk in the way of the Lord as their fathers did, or not. ^0222

So the Lord left those nations, not driving them out quickly, and he did not give them into the hand of Joshua. ^0223



Now these are the nations that the Lord left, to test Israel by them, that is, all in Israel who had not experienced all the wars in Canaan. ^0301

It was only in order that the generations of the people of Israel might know war, to teach war to those who had not known it before. ^0302

These are the nations: the five lords of the Philistines and all the Canaanites and the Sidonians and the Hivites who lived on Mount Lebanon, from Mount Baal-hermon as far as Lebo-hamath. ^0303

They were for the testing of Israel, to know whether Israel would obey the commandments of the Lord, which he commanded their fathers by the hand of Moses. ^0304

So the people of Israel lived among the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the Perizzites, the Hivites, and the Jebusites. ^0305

And their daughters they took to themselves for wives, and their own daughters they gave to their sons, and they served their gods. ^0306

And the people of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the Lord. They forgot the Lord their God and served the Baals and the Asheroth. ^0307

Therefore the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of Cushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia. And the people of Israel served Cushan-rishathaim eight years. ^0308

But when the people of Israel cried out to the Lord, the Lord raised up a deliverer for the people of Israel, who saved them, Othniel the son of Kenaz, Caleb’s younger brother. ^0309

The Spirit of the Lord was upon him, and he judged Israel. He went out to war, and the Lord gave Cushan-rishathaim king of Mesopotamia into his hand. And his hand prevailed over Cushan-rishathaim. ^0310

So the land had rest forty years. Then Othniel the son of Kenaz died. ^0311

And the people of Israel again did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, and the Lord strengthened Eglon the king of Moab against Israel, because they had done what was evil in the sight of the Lord. ^0312

He gathered to himself the Ammonites and the Amalekites, and went and defeated Israel. And they took possession of the city of palms. ^0313

And the people of Israel served Eglon the king of Moab eighteen years. ^0314

Then the people of Israel cried out to the Lord, and the Lord raised up for them a deliverer, Ehud, the son of Gera, the Benjaminite, a left-handed man. The people of Israel sent tribute by him to Eglon the king of Moab. ^0315

And Ehud made for himself a sword with two edges, a cubit in length, and he bound it on his right thigh under his clothes. ^0316

And he presented the tribute to Eglon king of Moab. Now Eglon was a very fat man. ^0317

And when Ehud had finished presenting the tribute, he sent away the people who carried the tribute. ^0318

But he himself turned back at the idols near Gilgal and said, I have a secret message for you, O king. And he commanded, Silence. And all his attendants went out from his presence. ^0319

And Ehud came to him as he was sitting alone in his cool roof chamber. And Ehud said, I have a message from God for you. And he arose from his seat. ^0320

And Ehud reached with his left hand, took the sword from his right thigh, and thrust it into his belly. ^0321

And the hilt also went in after the blade, and the fat closed over the blade, for he did not pull the sword out of his belly; and the dung came out. ^0322

Then Ehud went out into the porch and closed the doors of the roof chamber behind him and locked them. ^0323

When he had gone, the servants came, and when they saw that the doors of the roof chamber were locked, they thought, Surely he is relieving himself in the closet of the cool chamber. ^0324

And they waited till they were embarrassed. But when he still did not open the doors of the roof chamber, they took the key and opened them, and there lay their lord dead on the floor. ^0325

Ehud escaped while they delayed, and he passed beyond the idols and escaped to Seirah. ^0326

When he arrived, he sounded the trumpet in the hill country of Ephraim. Then the people of Israel went down with him from the hill country, and he was their leader. ^0327

And he said to them, Follow after me, for the Lord has given your enemies the Moabites into your hand. So they went down after him and seized the fords of the Jordan against the Moabites and did not allow anyone to pass over. ^0328

And they killed at that time about 10,000 of the Moabites, all strong, able-bodied men; not a man escaped. ^0329

So Moab was subdued that day under the hand of Israel. And the land had rest for eighty years. ^0330

After him was Shamgar the son of Anath, who killed 600 of the Philistines with an oxgoad, and he also saved Israel. ^0331



And the people of Israel again did what was evil in the sight of the Lord after Ehud died. ^0401

And the Lord sold them into the hand of Jabin king of Canaan, who reigned in Hazor. The commander of his army was Sisera, who lived in Harosheth-hagoyim. ^0402

Then the people of Israel cried out to the Lord for help, for he had 900 chariots of iron and he oppressed the people of Israel cruelly for twenty years. ^0403

Now Deborah, a prophetess, the wife of Lappidoth, was judging Israel at that time. ^0404

She used to sit under the palm of Deborah between Ramah and Bethel in the hill country of Ephraim, and the people of Israel came up to her for judgment. ^0405

She sent and summoned Barak the son of Abinoam from Kedesh-naphtali and said to him, Has not the Lord, the God of Israel, commanded you, Go, gather your men at Mount Tabor, taking 10,000 from the people of Naphtali and the people of Zebulun. ^0406

And I will draw out Sisera, the general of Jabin’s army, to meet you by the river Kishon with his chariots and his troops, and I will give him into your hand? ^0407

Barak said to her, If you will go with me, I will go, but if you will not go with me, I will not go. ^0408

And she said, I will surely go with you. Nevertheless, the road on which you are going will not lead to your glory, for the Lord will sell Sisera into the hand of a woman. Then Deborah arose and went with Barak to Kedesh. ^0409

And Barak called out Zebulun and Naphtali to Kedesh. And 10,000 men went up at his heels, and Deborah went up with him. ^0410

Now Heber the Kenite had separated from the Kenites, the descendants of Hobab the father-in-law of Moses, and had pitched his tent as far away as the oak in Zaanannim, which is near Kedesh. ^0411

When Sisera was told that Barak the son of Abinoam had gone up to Mount Tabor, ^0412

Sisera called out all his chariots, 900 chariots of iron, and all the men who were with him, from Harosheth-hagoyim to the river Kishon. ^0413

And Deborah said to Barak, Up! For this is the day in which the Lord has given Sisera into your hand. Does not the Lord go out before you? So Barak went down from Mount Tabor with 10,000 men following him. ^0414

And the Lord routed Sisera and all his chariots and all his army before Barak by the edge of the sword. And Sisera got down from his chariot and fled away on foot. ^0415

And Barak pursued the chariots and the army to Harosheth-hagoyim, and all the army of Sisera fell by the edge of the sword; not a man was left. ^0416

But Sisera fled away on foot to the tent of Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, for there was peace between Jabin the king of Hazor and the house of Heber the Kenite. ^0417

And Jael came out to meet Sisera and said to him, Turn aside, my lord; turn aside to me; do not be afraid. So he turned aside to her into the tent, and she covered him with a rug. ^0418

And he said to her, Please give me a little water to drink, for I am thirsty. So she opened a skin of milk and gave him a drink and covered him. ^0419

And he said to her, Stand at the opening of the tent, and if any man comes and asks you, Is anyone here? say, No. ^0420

But Jael the wife of Heber took a tent peg, and took a hammer in her hand. Then she went softly to him and drove the peg into his temple until it went down into the ground while he was lying fast asleep from weariness. So he died. ^0421

And behold, as Barak was pursuing Sisera, Jael went out to meet him and said to him, Come, and I will show you the man whom you are seeking. So he went in to her tent, and there lay Sisera dead, with the tent peg in his temple. ^0422

So on that day God subdued Jabin the king of Canaan before the people of Israel. ^0423

And the hand of the people of Israel pressed harder and harder against Jabin the king of Canaan, until they destroyed Jabin king of Canaan. ^0424



Then sang Deborah and Barak the son of Abinoam on that day : ^0501

That the leaders took the lead in Israel, that the people offered themselves willingly, bless the Lord! ^0502

Hear, O kings; give ear, O princes; to the Lord I will sing; I will make melody to the Lord, the God of Israel. ^0503

Lord, when you went out from Seir, when you marched from the region of Edom, the earth trembled and the heavens dropped, yes, the clouds dropped water. ^0504

The mountains quaked before the Lord, even Sinai before the Lord, the God of Israel. ^0505

In the days of Shamgar, son of Anath, in the days of Jael, the highways were abandoned, and travelers kept to the byways. ^0506

The villagers ceased in Israel; they ceased to be until I arose; I, Deborah, arose as a mother in Israel. ^0507

When new gods were chosen, then war was in the gates. Was shield or spear to be seen among forty thousand in Israel? ^0508

My heart goes out to the commanders of Israel who offered themselves willingly among the people. Bless the Lord. ^0509

Tell of it, you who ride on white donkeys, you who sit on rich carpets and you who walk by the way. ^0510

To the sound of musicians at the watering places, there they repeat the righteous triumphs of the Lord, the righteous triumphs of his villagers in Israel. Then down to the gates marched the people of the Lord. ^0511

Awake, awake, Deborah! Awake, awake, break out in a song! Arise, Barak, lead away your captives, O son of Abinoam. ^0512

Then down marched the remnant of the noble; the people of the Lord marched down for me against the mighty. ^0513

From Ephraim their root they marched down into the valley, following you, Benjamin, with your kinsmen; from Machir marched down the commanders, and from Zebulun those who bear the lieutenant’s staff; ^0514

the princes of Issachar came with Deborah, and Issachar faithful to Barak; into the valley they rushed at his heels. Among the clans of Reuben there were great searchings of heart. ^0515

Why did you sit still among the sheepfolds, to hear the whistling for the flocks? Among the clans of Reuben there were great searchings of heart. ^0516

Gilead stayed beyond the Jordan; and Dan, why did he stay with the ships? Asher sat still at the coast of the sea, staying by his landings. ^0517

Zebulun is a people who risked their lives to the death; Naphtali, too, on the heights of the field. ^0518

The kings came, they fought; then fought the kings of Canaan, at Taanach, by the waters of Megiddo; they got no spoils of silver. ^0519

From heaven the stars fought, from their courses they fought against Sisera. ^0520

The torrent Kishon swept them away, the ancient torrent, the torrent Kishon. March on, my soul, with might! ^0521

Then loud beat the horses ’ hoofs with the galloping, galloping of his steeds. ^0522

Curse Meroz, says the angel of the Lord, curse its inhabitants thoroughly, because they did not come to the help of the Lord, to the help of the Lord against the mighty. ^0523

Most blessed of women be Jael, the wife of Heber the Kenite, of tent-dwelling women most blessed. ^0524

He asked for water and she gave him milk; she brought him curds in a noble’s bowl. ^0525

She sent her hand to the tent peg and her right hand to the workmen’s mallet; she struck Sisera; she crushed his head; she shattered and pierced his temple. ^0526

Between her feet he sank, he fell, he lay still; between her feet he sank, he fell; where he sank, there he fell — dead. ^0527

Out of the window she peered, the mother of Sisera wailed through the lattice : Why is his chariot so long in coming? Why tarry the hoofbeats of his chariots? ^0528

Her wisest princesses answer, indeed, she answers herself, ^0529

Have they not found and divided the spoil ?— A womb or two for every man; spoil of dyed materials for Sisera, spoil of dyed materials embroidered, two pieces of dyed work embroidered for the neck as spoil? ^0530

So may all your enemies perish, O Lord! But your friends be like the sun as he rises in his might. And the land had rest for forty years. ^0531



The people of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, and the Lord gave them into the hand of Midian seven years. ^0601

And the hand of Midian overpowered Israel, and because of Midian the people of Israel made for themselves the dens that are in the mountains and the caves and the strongholds. ^0602

For whenever the Israelites planted crops, the Midianites and the Amalekites and the people of the East would come up against them. ^0603

They would encamp against them and devour the produce of the land, as far as Gaza, and leave no sustenance in Israel and no sheep or ox or donkey. ^0604

For they would come up with their livestock and their tents; they would come like locusts in number —both they and their camels could not be counted —so that they laid waste the land as they came in. ^0605

And Israel was brought very low because of Midian. And the people of Israel cried out for help to the Lord. ^0606

When the people of Israel cried out to the Lord on account of the Midianites, ^0607

the Lord sent a prophet to the people of Israel. And he said to them, Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel : I led you up from Egypt and brought you out of the house of slavery. ^0608

And I delivered you from the hand of the Egyptians and from the hand of all who oppressed you, and drove them out before you and gave you their land. ^0609

And I said to you, I am the Lord your God; you shall not fear the gods of the Amorites in whose land you dwell. But you have not obeyed my voice. ^0610

Now the angel of the Lord came and sat under the terebinth at Ophrah, which belonged to Joash the Abiezrite, while his son Gideon was beating out wheat in the winepress to hide it from the Midianites. ^0611

And the angel of the Lord appeared to him and said to him, The Lord is with you, O mighty man of valor. ^0612

And Gideon said to him, Please, sir, if the Lord is with us, why then has all this happened to us? And where are all his wonderful deeds that our fathers recounted to us, saying, Did not the Lord bring us up from Egypt? But now the Lord has forsaken us and given us into the hand of Midian. ^0613

And the Lord turned to him and said, Go in this might of yours and save Israel from the hand of Midian; do not I send you? ^0614

And he said to him, Please, Lord, how can I save Israel? Behold, my clan is the weakest in Manasseh, and I am the least in my father’s house. ^0615

And the Lord said to him, But I will be with you, and you shall strike the Midianites as one man. ^0616

And he said to him, If now I have found favor in your eyes, then show me a sign that it is you who speak with me. ^0617

Please do not depart from here until I come to you and bring out my present and set it before you. And he said, I will stay till you return. ^0618

So Gideon went into his house and prepared a young goat and unleavened cakes from an ephah of flour. The meat he put in a basket, and the broth he put in a pot, and brought them to him under the terebinth and presented them. ^0619

And the angel of God said to him, Take the meat and the unleavened cakes, and put them on this rock, and pour the broth over them. And he did so. ^0620

Then the angel of the Lord reached out the tip of the staff that was in his hand and touched the meat and the unleavened cakes. And fire sprang up from the rock and consumed the meat and the unleavened cakes. And the angel of the Lord vanished from his sight. ^0621

Then Gideon perceived that he was the angel of the Lord. And Gideon said, Alas, O Lord God! For now I have seen the angel of the Lord face to face. ^0622

But the Lord said to him, Peace be to you. Do not fear; you shall not die. ^0623

Then Gideon built an altar there to the Lord and called it, The Lord Is Peace. To this day it still stands at Ophrah, which belongs to the Abiezrites. ^0624

That night the Lord said to him, Take your father’s bull, and the second bull seven years old, and pull down the altar of Baal that your father has, and cut down the Asherah that is beside it ^0625

and build an altar to the Lord your God on the top of the stronghold here, with stones laid in due order. Then take the second bull and offer it as a burnt offering with the wood of the Asherah that you shall cut down. ^0626

So Gideon took ten men of his servants and did as the Lord had told him. But because he was too afraid of his family and the men of the town to do it by day, he did it by night. ^0627

When the men of the town rose early in the morning, behold, the altar of Baal was broken down, and the Asherah beside it was cut down, and the second bull was offered on the altar that had been built. ^0628

And they said to one another, Who has done this thing? And after they had searched and inquired, they said, Gideon the son of Joash has done this thing. ^0629

Then the men of the town said to Joash, Bring out your son, that he may die, for he has broken down the altar of Baal and cut down the Asherah beside it. ^0630

But Joash said to all who stood against him, Will you contend for Baal? Or will you save him? Whoever contends for him shall be put to death by morning. If he is a god, let him contend for himself, because his altar has been broken down. ^0631

Therefore on that day Gideon was called Jerubbaal, that is to say, Let Baal contend against him, because he broke down his altar. ^0632

Now all the Midianites and the Amalekites and the people of the East came together, and they crossed the Jordan and encamped in the Valley of Jezreel. ^0633

But the Spirit of the Lord clothed Gideon, and he sounded the trumpet, and the Abiezrites were called out to follow him. ^0634

And he sent messengers throughout all Manasseh, and they too were called out to follow him. And he sent messengers to Asher, Zebulun, and Naphtali, and they went up to meet them. ^0635

Then Gideon said to God, If you will save Israel by my hand, as you have said, ^0636

behold, I am laying a fleece of wool on the threshing floor. If there is dew on the fleece alone, and it is dry on all the ground, then I shall know that you will save Israel by my hand, as you have said. ^0637

And it was so. When he rose early next morning and squeezed the fleece, he wrung enough dew from the fleece to fill a bowl with water. ^0638

Then Gideon said to God, Let not your anger burn against me; let me speak just once more. Please let me test just once more with the fleece. Please let it be dry on the fleece only, and on all the ground let there be dew. ^0639

And God did so that night; and it was dry on the fleece only, and on all the ground there was dew. ^0640



Then Jerubbaal (that is, Gideon ) and all the people who were with him rose early and encamped beside the spring of Harod. And the camp of Midian was north of them, by the hill of Moreh, in the valley. ^0701

The Lord said to Gideon, The people with you are too many for me to give the Midianites into their hand, lest Israel boast over me, saying, My own hand has saved me. ^0702

Now therefore proclaim in the ears of the people, saying, Whoever is fearful and trembling, let him return home and hurry away from Mount Gilead. Then 22,000 of the people returned, and 10,000 remained. ^0703

And the Lord said to Gideon, The people are still too many. Take them down to the water, and I will test them for you there, and anyone of whom I say to you, This one shall go with you, shall go with you, and anyone of whom I say to you, This one shall not go with you, shall not go. ^0704

So he brought the people down to the water. And the Lord said to Gideon, Every one who laps the water with his tongue, as a dog laps, you shall set by himself. Likewise, every one who kneels down to drink. ^0705

And the number of those who lapped, putting their hands to their mouths, was 300 men, but all the rest of the people knelt down to drink water. ^0706

And the Lord said to Gideon, With the 300 men who lapped I will save you and give the Midianites into your hand, and let all the others go every man to his home. ^0707

So the people took provisions in their hands, and their trumpets. And he sent all the rest of Israel every man to his tent, but retained the 300 men. And the camp of Midian was below him in the valley. ^0708

That same night the Lord said to him, Arise, go down against the camp, for I have given it into your hand. ^0709

But if you are afraid to go down, go down to the camp with Purah your servant. ^0710

And you shall hear what they say, and afterward your hands shall be strengthened to go down against the camp. Then he went down with Purah his servant to the outposts of the armed men who were in the camp. ^0711

And the Midianites and the Amalekites and all the people of the East lay along the valley like locusts in abundance, and their camels were without number, as the sand that is on the seashore in abundance. ^0712

When Gideon came, behold, a man was telling a dream to his comrade. And he said, Behold, I dreamed a dream, and behold, a cake of barley bread tumbled into the camp of Midian and came to the tent and struck it so that it fell and turned it upside down, so that the tent lay flat. ^0713

And his comrade answered, This is no other than the sword of Gideon the son of Joash, a man of Israel; God has given into his hand Midian and all the camp. ^0714

As soon as Gideon heard the telling of the dream and its interpretation, he worshiped. And he returned to the camp of Israel and said, Arise, for the Lord has given the host of Midian into your hand. ^0715

And he divided the 300 men into three companies and put trumpets into the hands of all of them and empty jars, with torches inside the jars. ^0716

And he said to them, Look at me, and do likewise. When I come to the outskirts of the camp, do as I do. ^0717

When I blow the trumpet, I and all who are with me, then blow the trumpets also on every side of all the camp and shout, For the Lord and for Gideon. ^0718

So Gideon and the hundred men who were with him came to the outskirts of the camp at the beginning of the middle watch, when they had just set the watch. And they blew the trumpets and smashed the jars that were in their hands. ^0719

Then the three companies blew the trumpets and broke the jars. They held in their left hands the torches, and in their right hands the trumpets to blow. And they cried out, A sword for the Lord and for Gideon! ^0720

Every man stood in his place around the camp, and all the army ran. They cried out and fled. ^0721

When they blew the 300 trumpets, the Lord set every man’s sword against his comrade and against all the army. And the army fled as far as Beth-shittah toward Zererah, as far as the border of Abel-meholah, by Tabbath. ^0722

And the men of Israel were called out from Naphtali and from Asher and from all Manasseh, and they pursued after Midian. ^0723

Gideon sent messengers throughout all the hill country of Ephraim, saying, Come down against the Midianites and capture the waters against them, as far as Beth-barah, and also the Jordan. So all the men of Ephraim were called out, and they captured the waters as far as Beth-barah, and also the Jordan. ^0724

And they captured the two princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb. They killed Oreb at the rock of Oreb, and Zeeb they killed at the winepress of Zeeb. Then they pursued Midian, and they brought the heads of Oreb and Zeeb to Gideon across the Jordan. ^0725



Then the men of Ephraim said to him, What is this that you have done to us, not to call us when you went to fight against Midian? And they accused him fiercely. ^0801

And he said to them, What have I done now in comparison with you? Is not the gleaning of the grapes of Ephraim better than the grape harvest of Abiezer? ^0802

God has given into your hands the princes of Midian, Oreb and Zeeb. What have I been able to do in comparison with you? Then their anger against him subsided when he said this. ^0803

And Gideon came to the Jordan and crossed over, he and the 300 men who were with him, exhausted yet pursuing. ^0804

So he said to the men of Succoth, Please give loaves of bread to the people who follow me, for they are exhausted, and I am pursuing after Zebah and Zalmunna, the kings of Midian. ^0805

And the officials of Succoth said, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna already in your hand, that we should give bread to your army? ^0806

So Gideon said, Well then, when the Lord has given Zebah and Zalmunna into my hand, I will flail your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briers. ^0807

And from there he went up to Penuel, and spoke to them in the same way, and the men of Penuel answered him as the men of Succoth had answered. ^0808

And he said to the men of Penuel, When I come again in peace, I will break down this tower. ^0809

Now Zebah and Zalmunna were in Karkor with their army, about 15,000 men, all who were left of all the army of the people of the East, for there had fallen 120,000 men who drew the sword. ^0810

And Gideon went up by the way of the tent dwellers east of Nobah and Jogbehah and attacked the army, for the army felt secure. ^0811

And Zebah and Zalmunna fled, and he pursued them and captured the two kings of Midian, Zebah and Zalmunna, and he threw all the army into a panic. ^0812

Then Gideon the son of Joash returned from the battle by the ascent of Heres. ^0813

And he captured a young man of Succoth and questioned him. And he wrote down for him the officials and elders of Succoth, seventy-seven men. ^0814

And he came to the men of Succoth and said, Behold Zebah and Zalmunna, about whom you taunted me, saying, Are the hands of Zebah and Zalmunna already in your hand, that we should give bread to your men who are exhausted? ^0815

And he took the elders of the city, and he took thorns of the wilderness and briers and with them taught the men of Succoth a lesson. ^0816

And he broke down the tower of Penuel and killed the men of the city. ^0817

Then he said to Zebah and Zalmunna, Where are the men whom you killed at Tabor? They answered, As you are, so were they. Every one of them resembled the son of a king. ^0818

And he said, They were my brothers, the sons of my mother. As the Lord lives, if you had saved them alive, I would not kill you. ^0819

So he said to Jether his firstborn, Rise and kill them! But the young man did not draw his sword, for he was afraid, because he was still a young man. ^0820

Then Zebah and Zalmunna said, Rise yourself and fall upon us, for as the man is, so is his strength. And Gideon arose and killed Zebah and Zalmunna, and he took the crescent ornaments that were on the necks of their camels. ^0821

Then the men of Israel said to Gideon, Rule over us, you and your son and your grandson also, for you have saved us from the hand of Midian. ^0822

Gideon said to them, I will not rule over you, and my son will not rule over you; the Lord will rule over you. ^0823

And Gideon said to them, Let me make a request of you: every one of you give me the earrings from his spoil. (For they had golden earrings, because they were Ishmaelites .) ^0824

And they answered, We will willingly give them. And they spread a cloak, and every man threw in it the earrings of his spoil. ^0825

And the weight of the golden earrings that he requested was 1,700 shekels of gold, besides the crescent ornaments and the pendants and the purple garments worn by the kings of Midian, and besides the collars that were around the necks of their camels. ^0826

And Gideon made an ephod of it and put it in his city, in Ophrah. And all Israel whored after it there, and it became a snare to Gideon and to his family. ^0827

So Midian was subdued before the people of Israel, and they raised their heads no more. And the land had rest forty years in the days of Gideon. ^0828

Jerubbaal the son of Joash went and lived in his own house. ^0829

Now Gideon had seventy sons, his own offspring, for he had many wives. ^0830

And his concubine who was in Shechem also bore him a son, and he called his name Abimelech. ^0831

And Gideon the son of Joash died in a good old age and was buried in the tomb of Joash his father, at Ophrah of the Abiezrites. ^0832

As soon as Gideon died, the people of Israel turned again and whored after the Baals and made Baal-berith their god. ^0833

And the people of Israel did not remember the Lord their God, who had delivered them from the hand of all their enemies on every side, ^0834

and they did not show steadfast love to the family of Jerubbaal (that is, Gideon ) in return for all the good that he had done to Israel. ^0835



Now Abimelech the son of Jerubbaal went to Shechem to his mother’s relatives and said to them and to the whole clan of his mother’s family, ^0901

Say in the ears of all the leaders of Shechem, Which is better for you, that all seventy of the sons of Jerubbaal rule over you, or that one rule over you? Remember also that I am your bone and your flesh. ^0902

And his mother’s relatives spoke all these words on his behalf in the ears of all the leaders of Shechem, and their hearts inclined to follow Abimelech, for they said, He is our brother. ^0903

And they gave him seventy pieces of silver out of the house of Baal-berith with which Abimelech hired worthless and reckless fellows, who followed him. ^0904

And he went to his father’s house at Ophrah and killed his brothers the sons of Jerubbaal, seventy men, on one stone. But Jotham the youngest son of Jerubbaal was left, for he hid himself. ^0905

And all the leaders of Shechem came together, and all Beth-millo, and they went and made Abimelech king, by the oak of the pillar at Shechem. ^0906

When it was told to Jotham, he went and stood on top of Mount Gerizim and cried aloud and said to them, Listen to me, you leaders of Shechem, that God may listen to you. ^0907

The trees once went out to anoint a king over them, and they said to the olive tree, Reign over us. ^0908

But the olive tree said to them, Shall I leave my abundance, by which gods and men are honored, and go hold sway over the trees? ^0909

And the trees said to the fig tree, You come and reign over us. ^0910

But the fig tree said to them, Shall I leave my sweetness and my good fruit and go hold sway over the trees? ^0911

And the trees said to the vine, You come and reign over us. ^0912

But the vine said to them, Shall I leave my wine that cheers God and men and go hold sway over the trees? ^0913

Then all the trees said to the bramble, You come and reign over us. ^0914

And the bramble said to the trees, If in good faith you are anointing me king over you, then come and take refuge in my shade, but if not, let fire come out of the bramble and devour the cedars of Lebanon. ^0915

Now therefore, if you acted in good faith and integrity when you made Abimelech king, and if you have dealt well with Jerubbaal and his house and have done to him as his deeds deserved — ^0916

for my father fought for you and risked his life and delivered you from the hand of Midian, ^0917

and you have risen up against my father’s house this day and have killed his sons, seventy men on one stone, and have made Abimelech, the son of his female servant, king over the leaders of Shechem, because he is your relative — ^0918

if you then have acted in good faith and integrity with Jerubbaal and with his house this day, then rejoice in Abimelech, and let him also rejoice in you. ^0919

But if not, let fire come out from Abimelech and devour the leaders of Shechem and Beth-millo; and let fire come out from the leaders of Shechem and from Beth-millo and devour Abimelech. ^0920

And Jotham ran away and fled and went to Beer and lived there, because of Abimelech his brother. ^0921

Abimelech ruled over Israel three years. ^0922

And God sent an evil spirit between Abimelech and the leaders of Shechem, and the leaders of Shechem dealt treacherously with Abimelech, ^0923

that the violence done to the seventy sons of Jerubbaal might come, and their blood be laid on Abimelech their brother, who killed them, and on the men of Shechem, who strengthened his hands to kill his brothers. ^0924

And the leaders of Shechem put men in ambush against him on the mountaintops, and they robbed all who passed by them along that way. And it was told to Abimelech. ^0925

And Gaal the son of Ebed moved into Shechem with his relatives, and the leaders of Shechem put confidence in him. ^0926

And they went out into the field and gathered the grapes from their vineyards and trod them and held a festival; and they went into the house of their god and ate and drank and reviled Abimelech. ^0927

And Gaal the son of Ebed said, Who is Abimelech, and who are we of Shechem, that we should serve him? Is he not the son of Jerubbaal, and is not Zebul his officer? Serve the men of Hamor the father of Shechem; but why should we serve him? ^0928

Would that this people were under my hand! Then I would remove Abimelech. I would say to Abimelech, Increase your army, and come out. ^0929

When Zebul the ruler of the city heard the words of Gaal the son of Ebed, his anger was kindled. ^0930

And he sent messengers to Abimelech secretly, saying, Behold, Gaal the son of Ebed and his relatives have come to Shechem, and they are stirring up the city against you. ^0931

Now therefore, go by night, you and the people who are with you, and set an ambush in the field. ^0932

Then in the morning, as soon as the sun is up, rise early and rush upon the city. And when he and the people who are with him come out against you, you may do to them as your hand finds to do. ^0933

So Abimelech and all the men who were with him rose up by night and set an ambush against Shechem in four companies. ^0934

And Gaal the son of Ebed went out and stood in the entrance of the gate of the city, and Abimelech and the people who were with him rose from the ambush. ^0935

And when Gaal saw the people, he said to Zebul, Look, people are coming down from the mountaintops! And Zebul said to him, You mistake the shadow of the mountains for men. ^0936

Gaal spoke again and said, Look, people are coming down from the center of the land, and one company is coming from the direction of the Diviners ’ Oak. ^0937

Then Zebul said to him, Where is your mouth now, you who said, Who is Abimelech, that we should serve him? Are not these the people whom you despised? Go out now and fight with them. ^0938

And Gaal went out at the head of the leaders of Shechem and fought with Abimelech. ^0939

And Abimelech chased him, and he fled before him. And many fell wounded, up to the entrance of the gate. ^0940

And Abimelech lived at Arumah, and Zebul drove out Gaal and his relatives, so that they could not dwell at Shechem. ^0941

On the following day, the people went out into the field, and Abimelech was told. ^0942

He took his people and divided them into three companies and set an ambush in the fields. And he looked and saw the people coming out of the city. So he rose against them and killed them. ^0943

Abimelech and the company that was with him rushed forward and stood at the entrance of the gate of the city, while the two companies rushed upon all who were in the field and killed them. ^0944

And Abimelech fought against the city all that day. He captured the city and killed the people who were in it, and he razed the city and sowed it with salt. ^0945

When all the leaders of the Tower of Shechem heard of it, they entered the stronghold of the house of El-berith. ^0946

Abimelech was told that all the leaders of the Tower of Shechem were gathered together. ^0947

And Abimelech went up to Mount Zalmon, he and all the people who were with him. And Abimelech took an axe in his hand and cut down a bundle of brushwood and took it up and laid it on his shoulder. And he said to the men who were with him, What you have seen me do, hurry and do as I have done. ^0948

So every one of the people cut down his bundle and following Abimelech put it against the stronghold, and they set the stronghold on fire over them, so that all the people of the Tower of Shechem also died, about 1,000 men and women. ^0949

Then Abimelech went to Thebez and encamped against Thebez and captured it. ^0950

But there was a strong tower within the city, and all the men and women and all the leaders of the city fled to it and shut themselves in, and they went up to the roof of the tower. ^0951

And Abimelech came to the tower and fought against it and drew near to the door of the tower to burn it with fire. ^0952

And a certain woman threw an upper millstone on Abimelech’s head and crushed his skull. ^0953

Then he called quickly to the young man his armor-bearer and said to him, Draw your sword and kill me, lest they say of me, A woman killed him. And his young man thrust him through, and he died. ^0954

And when the men of Israel saw that Abimelech was dead, everyone departed to his home. ^0955

Thus God returned the evil of Abimelech, which he committed against his father in killing his seventy brothers. ^0956

And God also made all the evil of the men of Shechem return on their heads, and upon them came the curse of Jotham the son of Jerubbaal. ^0957



After Abimelech there arose to save Israel Tola the son of Puah, son of Dodo, a man of Issachar, and he lived at Shamir in the hill country of Ephraim. ^1001

And he judged Israel twenty-three years. Then he died and was buried at Shamir. ^1002

After him arose Jair the Gileadite, who judged Israel twenty-two years. ^1003

And he had thirty sons who rode on thirty donkeys, and they had thirty cities, called Havvoth-jair to this day, which are in the land of Gilead. ^1004

And Jair died and was buried in Kamon. ^1005

The people of Israel again did what was evil in the sight of the Lord and served the Baals and the Ashtaroth, the gods of Syria, the gods of Sidon, the gods of Moab, the gods of the Ammonites, and the gods of the Philistines. And they forsook the Lord and did not serve him. ^1006

So the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and he sold them into the hand of the Philistines and into the hand of the Ammonites, ^1007

and they crushed and oppressed the people of Israel that year. For eighteen years they oppressed all the people of Israel who were beyond the Jordan in the land of the Amorites, which is in Gilead. ^1008

And the Ammonites crossed the Jordan to fight also against Judah and against Benjamin and against the house of Ephraim, so that Israel was severely distressed. ^1009

And the people of Israel cried out to the Lord, saying, We have sinned against you, because we have forsaken our God and have served the Baals. ^1010

And the Lord said to the people of Israel, Did I not save you from the Egyptians and from the Amorites, from the Ammonites and from the Philistines? ^1011

The Sidonians also, and the Amalekites and the Maonites oppressed you, and you cried out to me, and I saved you out of their hand. ^1012

Yet you have forsaken me and served other gods; therefore I will save you no more. ^1013

Go and cry out to the gods whom you have chosen; let them save you in the time of your distress. ^1014

And the people of Israel said to the Lord, We have sinned; do to us whatever seems good to you. Only please deliver us this day. ^1015

So they put away the foreign gods from among them and served the Lord, and he became impatient over the misery of Israel. ^1016

Then the Ammonites were called to arms, and they encamped in Gilead. And the people of Israel came together, and they encamped at Mizpah. ^1017

And the people, the leaders of Gilead, said one to another, Who is the man who will begin to fight against the Ammonites? He shall be head over all the inhabitants of Gilead. ^1018



Now Jephthah the Gileadite was a mighty warrior, but he was the son of a prostitute. Gilead was the father of Jephthah. ^1101

And Gilead’s wife also bore him sons. And when his wife’s sons grew up, they drove Jephthah out and said to him, You shall not have an inheritance in our father’s house, for you are the son of another woman. ^1102

Then Jephthah fled from his brothers and lived in the land of Tob, and worthless fellows collected around Jephthah and went out with him. ^1103

After a time the Ammonites made war against Israel. ^1104

And when the Ammonites made war against Israel, the elders of Gilead went to bring Jephthah from the land of Tob. ^1105

And they said to Jephthah, Come and be our leader, that we may fight against the Ammonites. ^1106

But Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, Did you not hate me and drive me out of my father’s house? Why have you come to me now when you are in distress? ^1107

And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, That is why we have turned to you now, that you may go with us and fight against the Ammonites and be our head over all the inhabitants of Gilead. ^1108

Jephthah said to the elders of Gilead, If you bring me home again to fight against the Ammonites, and the Lord gives them over to me, I will be your head. ^1109

And the elders of Gilead said to Jephthah, The Lord will be witness between us, if we do not do as you say. ^1110

So Jephthah went with the elders of Gilead, and the people made him head and leader over them. And Jephthah spoke all his words before the Lord at Mizpah. ^1111

Then Jephthah sent messengers to the king of the Ammonites and said, What do you have against me, that you have come to me to fight against my land? ^1112

And the king of the Ammonites answered the messengers of Jephthah, Because Israel on coming up from Egypt took away my land, from the Arnon to the Jabbok and to the Jordan; now therefore restore it peaceably. ^1113

Jephthah again sent messengers to the king of the Ammonites ^1114

and said to him, Thus says Jephthah : Israel did not take away the land of Moab or the land of the Ammonites, ^1115

but when they came up from Egypt, Israel went through the wilderness to the Red Sea and came to Kadesh. ^1116

Israel then sent messengers to the king of Edom, saying, Please let us pass through your land, but the king of Edom would not listen. And they sent also to the king of Moab, but he would not consent. So Israel remained at Kadesh. ^1117

Then they journeyed through the wilderness and went around the land of Edom and the land of Moab and arrived on the east side of the land of Moab and camped on the other side of the Arnon. But they did not enter the territory of Moab, for the Arnon was the boundary of Moab. ^1118

Israel then sent messengers to Sihon king of the Amorites, king of Heshbon, and Israel said to him, Please let us pass through your land to our country, ^1119

but Sihon did not trust Israel to pass through his territory, so Sihon gathered all his people together and encamped at Jahaz and fought with Israel. ^1120

And the Lord, the God of Israel, gave Sihon and all his people into the hand of Israel, and they defeated them. So Israel took possession of all the land of the Amorites, who inhabited that country. ^1121

And they took possession of all the territory of the Amorites from the Arnon to the Jabbok and from the wilderness to the Jordan. ^1122

So then the Lord, the God of Israel, dispossessed the Amorites from before his people Israel; and are you to take possession of them? ^1123

Will you not possess what Chemosh your god gives you to possess? And all that the Lord our God has dispossessed before us, we will possess. ^1124

Now are you any better than Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab? Did he ever contend against Israel, or did he ever go to war with them? ^1125

While Israel lived in Heshbon and its villages, and in Aroer and its villages, and in all the cities that are on the banks of the Arnon, 300 years, why did you not deliver them within that time? ^1126

I therefore have not sinned against you, and you do me wrong by making war on me. The Lord, the Judge, decide this day between the people of Israel and the people of Ammon. ^1127

But the king of the Ammonites did not listen to the words of Jephthah that he sent to him. ^1128

Then the Spirit of the Lord was upon Jephthah, and he passed through Gilead and Manasseh and passed on to Mizpah of Gilead, and from Mizpah of Gilead he passed on to the Ammonites. ^1129

And Jephthah made a vow to the Lord and said, If you will give the Ammonites into my hand, ^1130

then whatever comes out from the doors of my house to meet me when I return in peace from the Ammonites shall be the Lord ’s, and I will offer it up for a burnt offering. ^1131

So Jephthah crossed over to the Ammonites to fight against them, and the Lord gave them into his hand. ^1132

And he struck them from Aroer to the neighborhood of Minnith, twenty cities, and as far as Abel-keramim, with a great blow. So the Ammonites were subdued before the people of Israel. ^1133

Then Jephthah came to his home at Mizpah. And behold, his daughter came out to meet him with tambourines and with dances. She was his only child; besides her he had neither son nor daughter. ^1134

And as soon as he saw her, he tore his clothes and said, Alas, my daughter! You have brought me very low, and you have become the cause of great trouble to me. For I have opened my mouth to the Lord, and I cannot take back my vow. ^1135

And she said to him, My father, you have opened your mouth to the Lord; do to me according to what has gone out of your mouth, now that the Lord has avenged you on your enemies, on the Ammonites. ^1136

So she said to her father, Let this thing be done for me: leave me alone two months, that I may go up and down on the mountains and weep for my virginity, I and my companions. ^1137

So he said, Go. Then he sent her away for two months, and she departed, she and her companions, and wept for her virginity on the mountains. ^1138

And at the end of two months, she returned to her father, who did with her according to his vow that he had made. She had never known a man, and it became a custom in Israel ^1139

that the daughters of Israel went year by year to lament the daughter of Jephthah the Gileadite four days in the year. ^1140



The men of Ephraim were called to arms, and they crossed to Zaphon and said to Jephthah, Why did you cross over to fight against the Ammonites and did not call us to go with you? We will burn your house over you with fire. ^1201

And Jephthah said to them, I and my people had a great dispute with the Ammonites, and when I called you, you did not save me from their hand. ^1202

And when I saw that you would not save me, I took my life in my hand and crossed over against the Ammonites, and the Lord gave them into my hand. Why then have you come up to me this day to fight against me? ^1203

Then Jephthah gathered all the men of Gilead and fought with Ephraim. And the men of Gilead struck Ephraim, because they said, You are fugitives of Ephraim, you Gileadites, in the midst of Ephraim and Manasseh. ^1204

And the Gileadites captured the fords of the Jordan against the Ephraimites. And when any of the fugitives of Ephraim said, Let me go over, the men of Gilead said to him, Are you an Ephraimite? When he said, No, ^1205

they said to him, Then say Shibboleth, and he said, Sibboleth, for he could not pronounce it right. Then they seized him and slaughtered him at the fords of the Jordan. At that time 42,000 of the Ephraimites fell. ^1206

Jephthah judged Israel six years. Then Jephthah the Gileadite died and was buried in his city in Gilead. ^1207

After him Ibzan of Bethlehem judged Israel. ^1208

He had thirty sons, and thirty daughters he gave in marriage outside his clan, and thirty daughters he brought in from outside for his sons. And he judged Israel seven years. ^1209

Then Ibzan died and was buried at Bethlehem. ^1210

After him Elon the Zebulunite judged Israel, and he judged Israel ten years. ^1211

Then Elon the Zebulunite died and was buried at Aijalon in the land of Zebulun. ^1212

After him Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite judged Israel. ^1213

He had forty sons and thirty grandsons, who rode on seventy donkeys, and he judged Israel eight years. ^1214

Then Abdon the son of Hillel the Pirathonite died and was buried at Pirathon in the land of Ephraim, in the hill country of the Amalekites. ^1215



And the people of Israel again did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, so the Lord gave them into the hand of the Philistines for forty years. ^1301

There was a certain man of Zorah, of the tribe of the Danites, whose name was Manoah. And his wife was barren and had no children. ^1302

And the angel of the Lord appeared to the woman and said to her, Behold, you are barren and have not borne children, but you shall conceive and bear a son. ^1303

Therefore be careful and drink no wine or strong drink, and eat nothing unclean, ^1304

for behold, you shall conceive and bear a son. No razor shall come upon his head, for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb, and he shall begin to save Israel from the hand of the Philistines. ^1305

Then the woman came and told her husband, A man of God came to me, and his appearance was like the appearance of the angel of God, very awesome. I did not ask him where he was from, and he did not tell me his name, ^1306

but he said to me, Behold, you shall conceive and bear a son. So then drink no wine or strong drink, and eat nothing unclean, for the child shall be a Nazirite to God from the womb to the day of his death. ^1307

Then Manoah prayed to the Lord and said, O Lord, please let the man of God whom you sent come again to us and teach us what we are to do with the child who will be born. ^1308

And God listened to the voice of Manoah, and the angel of God came again to the woman as she sat in the field. But Manoah her husband was not with her. ^1309

So the woman ran quickly and told her husband, Behold, the man who came to me the other day has appeared to me. ^1310

And Manoah arose and went after his wife and came to the man and said to him, Are you the man who spoke to this woman? And he said, I am. ^1311

And Manoah said, Now when your words come true, what is to be the child’s manner of life, and what is his mission? ^1312

And the angel of the Lord said to Manoah, Of all that I said to the woman let her be careful. ^1313

She may not eat of anything that comes from the vine, neither let her drink wine or strong drink, or eat any unclean thing. All that I commanded her let her observe. ^1314

Manoah said to the angel of the Lord, Please let us detain you and prepare a young goat for you. ^1315

And the angel of the Lord said to Manoah, If you detain me, I will not eat of your food. But if you prepare a burnt offering, then offer it to the Lord. (For Manoah did not know that he was the angel of the Lord .) ^1316

And Manoah said to the angel of the Lord, What is your name, so that, when your words come true, we may honor you? ^1317

And the angel of the Lord said to him, Why do you ask my name, seeing it is wonderful? ^1318

So Manoah took the young goat with the grain offering, and offered it on the rock to the Lord, to the one who works wonders, and Manoah and his wife were watching. ^1319

And when the flame went up toward heaven from the altar, the angel of the Lord went up in the flame of the altar. Now Manoah and his wife were watching, and they fell on their faces to the ground. ^1320

The angel of the Lord appeared no more to Manoah and to his wife. Then Manoah knew that he was the angel of the Lord. ^1321

And Manoah said to his wife, We shall surely die, for we have seen God. ^1322

But his wife said to him, If the Lord had meant to kill us, he would not have accepted a burnt offering and a grain offering at our hands, or shown us all these things, or now announced to us such things as these. ^1323

And the woman bore a son and called his name Samson. And the young man grew, and the Lord blessed him. ^1324

And the Spirit of the Lord began to stir him in Mahaneh-dan, between Zorah and Eshtaol. ^1325



Samson went down to Timnah, and at Timnah he saw one of the daughters of the Philistines. ^1401

Then he came up and told his father and mother, I saw one of the daughters of the Philistines at Timnah. Now get her for me as my wife. ^1402

But his father and mother said to him, Is there not a woman among the daughters of your relatives, or among all our people, that you must go to take a wife from the uncircumcised Philistines? But Samson said to his father, Get her for me, for she is right in my eyes. ^1403

His father and mother did not know that it was from the Lord, for he was seeking an opportunity against the Philistines. At that time the Philistines ruled over Israel. ^1404

Then Samson went down with his father and mother to Timnah, and they came to the vineyards of Timnah. And behold, a young lion came toward him roaring. ^1405

Then the Spirit of the Lord rushed upon him, and although he had nothing in his hand, he tore the lion in pieces as one tears a young goat. But he did not tell his father or his mother what he had done. ^1406

Then he went down and talked with the woman, and she was right in Samson’s eyes. ^1407

After some days he returned to take her. And he turned aside to see the carcass of the lion, and behold, there was a swarm of bees in the body of the lion, and honey. ^1408

He scraped it out into his hands and went on, eating as he went. And he came to his father and mother and gave some to them, and they ate. But he did not tell them that he had scraped the honey from the carcass of the lion. ^1409

His father went down to the woman, and Samson prepared a feast there, for so the young men used to do. ^1410

As soon as the people saw him, they brought thirty companions to be with him. ^1411

And Samson said to them, Let me now put a riddle to you. If you can tell me what it is, within the seven days of the feast, and find it out, then I will give you thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothes, ^1412

but if you cannot tell me what it is, then you shall give me thirty linen garments and thirty changes of clothes. And they said to him, Put your riddle, that we may hear it. ^1413

And he said to them, Out of the eater came something to eat. Out of the strong came something sweet. And in three days they could not solve the riddle. ^1414

On the fourth day they said to Samson’s wife, Entice your husband to tell us what the riddle is, lest we burn you and your father’s house with fire. Have you invited us here to impoverish us? ^1415

And Samson’s wife wept over him and said, You only hate me; you do not love me. You have put a riddle to my people, and you have not told me what it is. And he said to her, Behold, I have not told my father nor my mother, and shall I tell you? ^1416

She wept before him the seven days that their feast lasted, and on the seventh day he told her, because she pressed him hard. Then she told the riddle to her people. ^1417

And the men of the city said to him on the seventh day before the sun went down, What is sweeter than honey? What is stronger than a lion? And he said to them, If you had not plowed with my heifer, you would not have found out my riddle. ^1418

And the Spirit of the Lord rushed upon him, and he went down to Ashkelon and struck down thirty men of the town and took their spoil and gave the garments to those who had told the riddle. In hot anger he went back to his father’s house. ^1419

And Samson’s wife was given to his companion, who had been his best man. ^1420



After some days, at the time of wheat harvest, Samson went to visit his wife with a young goat. And he said, I will go in to my wife in the chamber. But her father would not allow him to go in. ^1501

And her father said, I really thought that you utterly hated her, so I gave her to your companion. Is not her younger sister more beautiful than she? Please take her instead. ^1502

And Samson said to them, This time I shall be innocent in regard to the Philistines, when I do them harm. ^1503

So Samson went and caught 300 foxes and took torches. And he turned them tail to tail and put a torch between each pair of tails. ^1504

And when he had set fire to the torches, he let the foxes go into the standing grain of the Philistines and set fire to the stacked grain and the standing grain, as well as the olive orchards. ^1505

Then the Philistines said, Who has done this? And they said, Samson, the son-in-law of the Timnite, because he has taken his wife and given her to his companion. And the Philistines came up and burned her and her father with fire. ^1506

And Samson said to them, If this is what you do, I swear I will be avenged on you, and after that I will quit. ^1507

And he struck them hip and thigh with a great blow, and he went down and stayed in the cleft of the rock of Etam. ^1508

Then the Philistines came up and encamped in Judah and made a raid on Lehi. ^1509

And the men of Judah said, Why have you come up against us? They said, We have come up to bind Samson, to do to him as he did to us. ^1510

Then 3,000 men of Judah went down to the cleft of the rock of Etam, and said to Samson, Do you not know that the Philistines are rulers over us? What then is this that you have done to us? And he said to them, As they did to me, so have I done to them. ^1511

And they said to him, We have come down to bind you, that we may give you into the hands of the Philistines. And Samson said to them, Swear to me that you will not attack me yourselves. ^1512

They said to him, No; we will only bind you and give you into their hands. We will surely not kill you. So they bound him with two new ropes and brought him up from the rock. ^1513

When he came to Lehi, the Philistines came shouting to meet him. Then the Spirit of the Lord rushed upon him, and the ropes that were on his arms became as flax that has caught fire, and his bonds melted off his hands. ^1514

And he found a fresh jawbone of a donkey, and put out his hand and took it, and with it he struck 1,000 men. ^1515

And Samson said, With the jawbone of a donkey, heaps upon heaps, with the jawbone of a donkey have I struck down a thousand men. ^1516

As soon as he had finished speaking, he threw away the jawbone out of his hand. And that place was called Ramath-lehi. ^1517

And he was very thirsty, and he called upon the Lord and said, You have granted this great salvation by the hand of your servant, and shall I now die of thirst and fall into the hands of the uncircumcised? ^1518

And God split open the hollow place that is at Lehi, and water came out from it. And when he drank, his spirit returned, and he revived. Therefore the name of it was called En-hakkore; it is at Lehi to this day. ^1519

And he judged Israel in the days of the Philistines twenty years. ^1520



Samson went to Gaza, and there he saw a prostitute, and he went in to her. ^1601

The Gazites were told, Samson has come here. And they surrounded the place and set an ambush for him all night at the gate of the city. They kept quiet all night, saying, Let us wait till the light of the morning; then we will kill him. ^1602

But Samson lay till midnight, and at midnight he arose and took hold of the doors of the gate of the city and the two posts, and pulled them up, bar and all, and put them on his shoulders and carried them to the top of the hill that is in front of Hebron. ^1603

After this he loved a woman in the Valley of Sorek, whose name was Delilah. ^1604

And the lords of the Philistines came up to her and said to her, Seduce him, and see where his great strength lies, and by what means we may overpower him, that we may bind him to humble him. And we will each give you 1,100 pieces of silver. ^1605

So Delilah said to Samson, Please tell me where your great strength lies, and how you might be bound, that one could subdue you. ^1606

Samson said to her, If they bind me with seven fresh bowstrings that have not been dried, then I shall become weak and be like any other man. ^1607

Then the lords of the Philistines brought up to her seven fresh bowstrings that had not been dried, and she bound him with them. ^1608

Now she had men lying in ambush in an inner chamber. And she said to him, The Philistines are upon you, Samson! But he snapped the bowstrings, as a thread of flax snaps when it touches the fire. So the secret of his strength was not known. ^1609

Then Delilah said to Samson, Behold, you have mocked me and told me lies. Please tell me how you might be bound. ^1610

And he said to her, If they bind me with new ropes that have not been used, then I shall become weak and be like any other man. ^1611

So Delilah took new ropes and bound him with them and said to him, The Philistines are upon you, Samson! And the men lying in ambush were in an inner chamber. But he snapped the ropes off his arms like a thread. ^1612

Then Delilah said to Samson, Until now you have mocked me and told me lies. Tell me how you might be bound. And he said to her, If you weave the seven locks of my head with the web and fasten it tight with the pin, then I shall become weak and be like any other man. ^1613

So while he slept, Delilah took the seven locks of his head and wove them into the web. And she made them tight with the pin and said to him, The Philistines are upon you, Samson! But he awoke from his sleep and pulled away the pin, the loom, and the web. ^1614

And she said to him, How can you say, I love you, when your heart is not with me? You have mocked me these three times, and you have not told me where your great strength lies. ^1615

And when she pressed him hard with her words day after day, and urged him, his soul was vexed to death. ^1616

And he told her all his heart, and said to her, A razor has never come upon my head, for I have been a Nazirite to God from my mother’s womb. If my head is shaved, then my strength will leave me, and I shall become weak and be like any other man. ^1617

When Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart, she sent and called the lords of the Philistines, saying, Come up again, for he has told me all his heart. Then the lords of the Philistines came up to her and brought the money in their hands. ^1618

She made him sleep on her knees. And she called a man and had him shave off the seven locks of his head. Then she began to torment him, and his strength left him. ^1619

And she said, The Philistines are upon you, Samson! And he awoke from his sleep and said, I will go out as at other times and shake myself free. But he did not know that the Lord had left him. ^1620

And the Philistines seized him and gouged out his eyes and brought him down to Gaza and bound him with bronze shackles. And he ground at the mill in the prison. ^1621

But the hair of his head began to grow again after it had been shaved. ^1622

Now the lords of the Philistines gathered to offer a great sacrifice to Dagon their god and to rejoice, and they said, Our god has given Samson our enemy into our hand. ^1623

And when the people saw him, they praised their god. For they said, Our god has given our enemy into our hand, the ravager of our country, who has killed many of us. ^1624

And when their hearts were merry, they said, Call Samson, that he may entertain us. So they called Samson out of the prison, and he entertained them. They made him stand between the pillars. ^1625

And Samson said to the young man who held him by the hand, Let me feel the pillars on which the house rests, that I may lean against them. ^1626

Now the house was full of men and women. All the lords of the Philistines were there, and on the roof there were about 3,000 men and women, who looked on while Samson entertained. ^1627

Then Samson called to the Lord and said, O Lord God, please remember me and please strengthen me only this once, O God, that I may be avenged on the Philistines for my two eyes. ^1628

And Samson grasped the two middle pillars on which the house rested, and he leaned his weight against them, his right hand on the one and his left hand on the other. ^1629

And Samson said, Let me die with the Philistines. Then he bowed with all his strength, and the house fell upon the lords and upon all the people who were in it. So the dead whom he killed at his death were more than those whom he had killed during his life. ^1630

Then his brothers and all his family came down and took him and brought him up and buried him between Zorah and Eshtaol in the tomb of Manoah his father. He had judged Israel twenty years. ^1631



There was a man of the hill country of Ephraim, whose name was Micah. ^1701

And he said to his mother, The 1,100 pieces of silver that were taken from you, about which you uttered a curse, and also spoke it in my ears, behold, the silver is with me; I took it. And his mother said, Blessed be my son by the Lord. ^1702

And he restored the 1,100 pieces of silver to his mother. And his mother said, I dedicate the silver to the Lord from my hand for my son, to make a carved image and a metal image. Now therefore I will restore it to you. ^1703

So when he restored the money to his mother, his mother took 200 pieces of silver and gave it to the silversmith, who made it into a carved image and a metal image. And it was in the house of Micah. ^1704

And the man Micah had a shrine, and he made an ephod and household gods, and ordained one of his sons, who became his priest. ^1705

In those days there was no king in Israel. Everyone did what was right in his own eyes. ^1706

Now there was a young man of Bethlehem in Judah, of the family of Judah, who was a Levite, and he sojourned there. ^1707

And the man departed from the town of Bethlehem in Judah to sojourn where he could find a place. And as he journeyed, he came to the hill country of Ephraim to the house of Micah. ^1708

And Micah said to him, Where do you come from? And he said to him, I am a Levite of Bethlehem in Judah, and I am going to sojourn where I may find a place. ^1709

And Micah said to him, Stay with me, and be to me a father and a priest, and I will give you ten pieces of silver a year and a suit of clothes and your living. And the Levite went in. ^1710

And the Levite was content to dwell with the man, and the young man became to him like one of his sons. ^1711

And Micah ordained the Levite, and the young man became his priest, and was in the house of Micah. ^1712

Then Micah said, Now I know that the Lord will prosper me, because I have a Levite as priest. ^1713



In those days there was no king in Israel. And in those days the tribe of the people of Dan was seeking for itself an inheritance to dwell in, for until then no inheritance among the tribes of Israel had fallen to them. ^1801

So the people of Dan sent five able men from the whole number of their tribe, from Zorah and from Eshtaol, to spy out the land and to explore it. And they said to them, Go and explore the land. And they came to the hill country of Ephraim, to the house of Micah, and lodged there. ^1802

When they were by the house of Micah, they recognized the voice of the young Levite. And they turned aside and said to him, Who brought you here? What are you doing in this place? What is your business here? ^1803

And he said to them, This is how Micah dealt with me: he has hired me, and I have become his priest. ^1804

And they said to him, Inquire of God, please, that we may know whether the journey on which we are setting out will succeed. ^1805

And the priest said to them, Go in peace. The journey on which you go is under the eye of the Lord. ^1806

Then the five men departed and came to Laish and saw the people who were there, how they lived in security, after the manner of the Sidonians, quiet and unsuspecting, lacking nothing that is in the earth and possessing wealth, and how they were far from the Sidonians and had no dealings with anyone. ^1807

And when they came to their brothers at Zorah and Eshtaol, their brothers said to them, What do you report? ^1808

They said, Arise, and let us go up against them, for we have seen the land, and behold, it is very good. And will you do nothing? Do not be slow to go, to enter in and possess the land. ^1809

As soon as you go, you will come to an unsuspecting people. The land is spacious, for God has given it into your hands, a place where there is no lack of anything that is in the earth. ^1810

So 600 men of the tribe of Dan, armed with weapons of war, set out from Zorah and Eshtaol, ^1811

and went up and encamped at Kiriath-jearim in Judah. On this account that place is called Mahaneh-dan to this day; behold, it is west of Kiriath-jearim. ^1812

And they passed on from there to the hill country of Ephraim, and came to the house of Micah. ^1813

Then the five men who had gone to scout out the country of Laish said to their brothers, Do you know that in these houses there are an ephod, household gods, a carved image, and a metal image? Now therefore consider what you will do. ^1814

And they turned aside there and came to the house of the young Levite, at the home of Micah, and asked him about his welfare. ^1815

Now the 600 men of the Danites, armed with their weapons of war, stood by the entrance of the gate. ^1816

And the five men who had gone to scout out the land went up and entered and took the carved image, the ephod, the household gods, and the metal image, while the priest stood by the entrance of the gate with the 600 men armed with weapons of war. ^1817

And when these went into Micah’s house and took the carved image, the ephod, the household gods, and the metal image, the priest said to them, What are you doing? ^1818

And they said to him, Keep quiet; put your hand on your mouth and come with us and be to us a father and a priest. Is it better for you to be priest to the house of one man, or to be priest to a tribe and clan in Israel? ^1819

And the priest’s heart was glad. He took the ephod and the household gods and the carved image and went along with the people. ^1820

So they turned and departed, putting the little ones and the livestock and the goods in front of them. ^1821

When they had gone a distance from the home of Micah, the men who were in the houses near Micah’s house were called out, and they overtook the people of Dan. ^1822

And they shouted to the people of Dan, who turned around and said to Micah, What is the matter with you, that you come with such a company? ^1823

And he said, You take my gods that I made and the priest, and go away, and what have I left? How then do you ask me, What is the matter with you? ^1824

And the people of Dan said to him, Do not let your voice be heard among us, lest angry fellows fall upon you, and you lose your life with the lives of your household. ^1825

Then the people of Dan went their way. And when Micah saw that they were too strong for him, he turned and went back to his home. ^1826

But the people of Dan took what Micah had made, and the priest who belonged to him, and they came to Laish, to a people quiet and unsuspecting, and struck them with the edge of the sword and burned the city with fire. ^1827

And there was no deliverer because it was far from Sidon, and they had no dealings with anyone. It was in the valley that belongs to Beth-rehob. Then they rebuilt the city and lived in it. ^1828

And they named the city Dan, after the name of Dan their ancestor, who was born to Israel; but the name of the city was Laish at the first. ^1829

And the people of Dan set up the carved image for themselves, and Jonathan the son of Gershom, son of Moses, and his sons were priests to the tribe of the Danites until the day of the captivity of the land. ^1830

So they set up Micah’s carved image that he made, as long as the house of God was at Shiloh. ^1831



In those days, when there was no king in Israel, a certain Levite was sojourning in the remote parts of the hill country of Ephraim, who took to himself a concubine from Bethlehem in Judah. ^1901

And his concubine was unfaithful to him, and she went away from him to her father’s house at Bethlehem in Judah, and was there some four months. ^1902

Then her husband arose and went after her, to speak kindly to her and bring her back. He had with him his servant and a couple of donkeys. And she brought him into her father’s house. And when the girl’s father saw him, he came with joy to meet him. ^1903

And his father-in-law, the girl’s father, made him stay, and he remained with him three days. So they ate and drank and spent the night there. ^1904

And on the fourth day they arose early in the morning, and he prepared to go, but the girl’s father said to his son-in-law, Strengthen your heart with a morsel of bread, and after that you may go. ^1905

So the two of them sat and ate and drank together. And the girl’s father said to the man, Be pleased to spend the night, and let your heart be merry. ^1906

And when the man rose up to go, his father-in-law pressed him, till he spent the night there again. ^1907

And on the fifth day he arose early in the morning to depart. And the girl’s father said, Strengthen your heart and wait until the day declines. So they ate, both of them. ^1908

And when the man and his concubine and his servant rose up to depart, his father-in-law, the girl’s father, said to him, Behold, now the day has waned toward evening. Please, spend the night. Behold, the day draws to its close. Lodge here and let your heart be merry, and tomorrow you shall arise early in the morning for your journey, and go home. ^1909

But the man would not spend the night. He rose up and departed and arrived opposite Jebus (that is, Jerusalem ). He had with him a couple of saddled donkeys, and his concubine was with him. ^1910

When they were near Jebus, the day was nearly over, and the servant said to his master, Come now, let us turn aside to this city of the Jebusites and spend the night in it. ^1911

And his master said to him, We will not turn aside into the city of foreigners, who do not belong to the people of Israel, but we will pass on to Gibeah. ^1912

And he said to his young man, Come and let us draw near to one of these places and spend the night at Gibeah or at Ramah. ^1913

So they passed on and went their way. And the sun went down on them near Gibeah, which belongs to Benjamin, ^1914

and they turned aside there, to go in and spend the night at Gibeah. And he went in and sat down in the open square of the city, for no one took them into his house to spend the night. ^1915

And behold, an old man was coming from his work in the field at evening. The man was from the hill country of Ephraim, and he was sojourning in Gibeah. The men of the place were Benjaminites. ^1916

And he lifted up his eyes and saw the traveler in the open square of the city. And the old man said, Where are you going? And where do you come from? ^1917

And he said to him, We are passing from Bethlehem in Judah to the remote parts of the hill country of Ephraim, from which I come. I went to Bethlehem in Judah, and I am going to the house of the Lord, but no one has taken me into his house. ^1918

We have straw and feed for our donkeys, with bread and wine for me and your female servant and the young man with your servants. There is no lack of anything. ^1919

And the old man said, Peace be to you; I will care for all your wants. Only, do not spend the night in the square. ^1920

So he brought him into his house and gave the donkeys feed. And they washed their feet, and ate and drank. ^1921

As they were making their hearts merry, behold, the men of the city, worthless fellows, surrounded the house, beating on the door. And they said to the old man, the master of the house, Bring out the man who came into your house, that we may know him. ^1922

And the man, the master of the house, went out to them and said to them, No, my brothers, do not act so wickedly; since this man has come into my house, do not do this vile thing. ^1923

Behold, here are my virgin daughter and his concubine. Let me bring them out now. Violate them and do with them what seems good to you, but against this man do not do this outrageous thing. ^1924

But the men would not listen to him. So the man seized his concubine and made her go out to them. And they knew her and abused her all night until the morning. And as the dawn began to break, they let her go. ^1925

And as morning appeared, the woman came and fell down at the door of the man’s house where her master was, until it was light. ^1926

And her master rose up in the morning, and when he opened the doors of the house and went out to go on his way, behold, there was his concubine lying at the door of the house, with her hands on the threshold. ^1927

He said to her, Get up, let us be going. But there was no answer. Then he put her on the donkey, and the man rose up and went away to his home. ^1928

And when he entered his house, he took a knife, and taking hold of his concubine he divided her, limb by limb, into twelve pieces, and sent her throughout all the territory of Israel. ^1929

And all who saw it said, Such a thing has never happened or been seen from the day that the people of Israel came up out of the land of Egypt until this day; consider it, take counsel, and speak. ^1930



Then all the people of Israel came out, from Dan to Beersheba, including the land of Gilead, and the congregation assembled as one man to the Lord at Mizpah. ^2001

And the chiefs of all the people, of all the tribes of Israel, presented themselves in the assembly of the people of God, 400,000 men on foot that drew the sword. ^2002

(Now the people of Benjamin heard that the people of Israel had gone up to Mizpah .) And the people of Israel said, Tell us, how did this evil happen? ^2003

And the Levite, the husband of the woman who was murdered, answered and said, I came to Gibeah that belongs to Benjamin, I and my concubine, to spend the night. ^2004

And the leaders of Gibeah rose against me and surrounded the house against me by night. They meant to kill me, and they violated my concubine, and she is dead. ^2005

So I took hold of my concubine and cut her in pieces and sent her throughout all the country of the inheritance of Israel, for they have committed abomination and outrage in Israel. ^2006

Behold, you people of Israel, all of you, give your advice and counsel here. ^2007

And all the people arose as one man, saying, None of us will go to his tent, and none of us will return to his house. ^2008

But now this is what we will do to Gibeah : we will go up against it by lot, ^2009

and we will take ten men of a hundred throughout all the tribes of Israel, and a hundred of a thousand, and a thousand of ten thousand, to bring provisions for the people, that when they come they may repay Gibeah of Benjamin, for all the outrage that they have committed in Israel. ^2010

So all the men of Israel gathered against the city, united as one man. ^2011

And the tribes of Israel sent men through all the tribe of Benjamin, saying, What evil is this that has taken place among you? ^2012

Now therefore give up the men, the worthless fellows in Gibeah, that we may put them to death and purge evil from Israel. But the Benjaminites would not listen to the voice of their brothers, the people of Israel. ^2013

Then the people of Benjamin came together out of the cities to Gibeah to go out to battle against the people of Israel. ^2014

And the people of Benjamin mustered out of their cities on that day 26,000 men who drew the sword, besides the inhabitants of Gibeah, who mustered 700 chosen men. ^2015

Among all these were 700 chosen men who were left-handed; every one could sling a stone at a hair and not miss. ^2016

And the men of Israel, apart from Benjamin, mustered 400,000 men who drew the sword; all these were men of war. ^2017

The people of Israel arose and went up to Bethel and inquired of God, Who shall go up first for us to fight against the people of Benjamin? And the Lord said, Judah shall go up first. ^2018

Then the people of Israel rose in the morning and encamped against Gibeah. ^2019

And the men of Israel went out to fight against Benjamin, and the men of Israel drew up the battle line against them at Gibeah. ^2020

The people of Benjamin came out of Gibeah and destroyed on that day 22,000 men of the Israelites. ^2021

But the people, the men of Israel, took courage, and again formed the battle line in the same place where they had formed it on the first day. ^2022

And the people of Israel went up and wept before the Lord until the evening. And they inquired of the Lord, Shall we again draw near to fight against our brothers, the people of Benjamin? And the Lord said, Go up against them. ^2023

So the people of Israel came near against the people of Benjamin the second day. ^2024

And Benjamin went against them out of Gibeah the second day, and destroyed 18,000 men of the people of Israel. All these were men who drew the sword. ^2025

Then all the people of Israel, the whole army, went up and came to Bethel and wept. They sat there before the Lord and fasted that day until evening, and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings before the Lord. ^2026

And the people of Israel inquired of the Lord (for the ark of the covenant of God was there in those days, ^2027

and Phinehas the son of Eleazar, son of Aaron, ministered before it in those days ), saying, Shall we go out once more to battle against our brothers, the people of Benjamin, or shall we cease? And the Lord said, Go up, for tomorrow I will give them into your hand. ^2028

So Israel set men in ambush around Gibeah. ^2029

And the people of Israel went up against the people of Benjamin on the third day and set themselves in array against Gibeah, as at other times. ^2030

And the people of Benjamin went out against the people and were drawn away from the city. And as at other times they began to strike and kill some of the people in the highways, one of which goes up to Bethel and the other to Gibeah, and in the open country, about thirty men of Israel. ^2031

And the people of Benjamin said, They are routed before us, as at the first. But the people of Israel said, Let us flee and draw them away from the city to the highways. ^2032

And all the men of Israel rose up out of their place and set themselves in array at Baal-tamar, and the men of Israel who were in ambush rushed out of their place from Maareh-geba. ^2033

And there came against Gibeah 10,000 chosen men out of all Israel, and the battle was hard, but the Benjaminites did not know that disaster was close upon them. ^2034

And the Lord defeated Benjamin before Israel, and the people of Israel destroyed 25,100 men of Benjamin that day. All these were men who drew the sword. ^2035

So the people of Benjamin saw that they were defeated. The men of Israel gave ground to Benjamin, because they trusted the men in ambush whom they had set against Gibeah. ^2036

Then the men in ambush hurried and rushed against Gibeah; the men in ambush moved out and struck all the city with the edge of the sword. ^2037

Now the appointed signal between the men of Israel and the men in the main ambush was that when they made a great cloud of smoke rise up out of the city ^2038

the men of Israel should turn in battle. Now Benjamin had begun to strike and kill about thirty men of Israel. They said, Surely they are defeated before us, as in the first battle. ^2039

But when the signal began to rise out of the city in a column of smoke, the Benjaminites looked behind them, and behold, the whole of the city went up in smoke to heaven. ^2040

Then the men of Israel turned, and the men of Benjamin were dismayed, for they saw that disaster was close upon them. ^2041

Therefore they turned their backs before the men of Israel in the direction of the wilderness, but the battle overtook them. And those who came out of the cities were destroying them in their midst. ^2042

Surrounding the Benjaminites, they pursued them and trod them down from Nohah as far as opposite Gibeah on the east. ^2043

Eighteen thousand men of Benjamin fell, all of them men of valor. ^2044

And they turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon. Five thousand men of them were cut down in the highways. And they were pursued hard to Gidom, and 2,000 men of them were struck down. ^2045

So all who fell that day of Benjamin were 25,000 men who drew the sword, all of them men of valor. ^2046

But 600 men turned and fled toward the wilderness to the rock of Rimmon and remained at the rock of Rimmon four months. ^2047

And the men of Israel turned back against the people of Benjamin and struck them with the edge of the sword, the city, men and beasts and all that they found. And all the towns that they found they set on fire. ^2048



Now the men of Israel had sworn at Mizpah, No one of us shall give his daughter in marriage to Benjamin. ^2101

And the people came to Bethel and sat there till evening before God, and they lifted up their voices and wept bitterly. ^2102

And they said, O Lord, the God of Israel, why has this happened in Israel, that today there should be one tribe lacking in Israel? ^2103

And the next day the people rose early and built there an altar and offered burnt offerings and peace offerings. ^2104

And the people of Israel said, Which of all the tribes of Israel did not come up in the assembly to the Lord? For they had taken a great oath concerning him who did not come up to the Lord to Mizpah, saying, He shall surely be put to death. ^2105

And the people of Israel had compassion for Benjamin their brother and said, One tribe is cut off from Israel this day. ^2106

What shall we do for wives for those who are left, since we have sworn by the Lord that we will not give them any of our daughters for wives? ^2107

And they said, What one is there of the tribes of Israel that did not come up to the Lord to Mizpah? And behold, no one had come to the camp from Jabesh-gilead, to the assembly. ^2108

For when the people were mustered, behold, not one of the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead was there. ^2109

So the congregation sent 12,000 of their bravest men there and commanded them, Go and strike the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead with the edge of the sword; also the women and the little ones. ^2110

This is what you shall do : every male and every woman that has lain with a male you shall devote to destruction. ^2111

And they found among the inhabitants of Jabesh-gilead 400 young virgins who had not known a man by lying with him, and they brought them to the camp at Shiloh, which is in the land of Canaan. ^2112

Then the whole congregation sent word to the people of Benjamin who were at the rock of Rimmon and proclaimed peace to them. ^2113

And Benjamin returned at that time. And they gave them the women whom they had saved alive of the women of Jabesh-gilead, but they were not enough for them. ^2114

And the people had compassion on Benjamin because the Lord had made a breach in the tribes of Israel. ^2115

Then the elders of the congregation said, What shall we do for wives for those who are left, since the women are destroyed out of Benjamin? ^2116

And they said, There must be an inheritance for the survivors of Benjamin, that a tribe not be blotted out from Israel. ^2117

Yet we cannot give them wives from our daughters. For the people of Israel had sworn, Cursed be he who gives a wife to Benjamin. ^2118

So they said, Behold, there is the yearly feast of the Lord at Shiloh, which is north of Bethel, on the east of the highway that goes up from Bethel to Shechem, and south of Lebonah. ^2119

And they commanded the people of Benjamin, saying, Go and lie in ambush in the vineyards ^2120

and watch. If the daughters of Shiloh come out to dance in the dances, then come out of the vineyards and snatch each man his wife from the daughters of Shiloh, and go to the land of Benjamin. ^2121

And when their fathers or their brothers come to complain to us, we will say to them, Grant them graciously to us, because we did not take for each man of them his wife in battle, neither did you give them to them, else you would now be guilty. ^2122

And the people of Benjamin did so and took their wives, according to their number, from the dancers whom they carried off. Then they went and returned to their inheritance and rebuilt the towns and lived in them. ^2123

And the people of Israel departed from there at that time, every man to his tribe and family, and they went out from there every man to his inheritance. ^2124

In those days there was no king in Israel. Everyone did what was right in his own eyes. ^2125
