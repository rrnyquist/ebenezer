[[H310|After]] [[H4194|the death]] [[H3091|of Joshua,]] [[H1121|the Israelites]] [[H7592|inquired]] [[H3068|of the LORD,]] [[H4310|“Who]] [[H8462|will be the first]] [[H5927|to go up]] [[H3898|and fight]] [[H413|for us  against]] [[H3669|the Canaanites?”]] ^0101

[[H3068|The LORD]] [[H559|answered,]] [[H3063|“Judah]] [[H5927|shall go up.]] [[H2009|Indeed,]] [[H5414|I have delivered]] [[H776|the land]] [[H3027|into their hands.”]] ^0102

[[H3063|Then the men of Judah]] [[H559|said]] [[H251|to their brothers]] [[H8095|the Simeonites,]] [[H5927|“Come up]] [[H854|with us]] [[H1486|to our allotted territory,]] [[H3898|and let us fight]] [[H3669|against the Canaanites.]] [[H589|And we]] [[H1571|likewise]] [[H1980|will go]] [[H854|with you]] [[H1486|to your territory.”]] [[H8095|So the Simeonites]] [[H1980|went]] [[H854|with them.]] ^0103

[[H3063|When Judah]] [[H5927|attacked,]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H5414|delivered]] [[H3669|the Canaanites]] [[H6522|and Perizzites]] [[H3027|into their hands,]] [[H5221|and they struck down]] [[H6235|ten]] [[H505|thousand]] [[H376|men]] [[H966|at Bezek.]] ^0104

[[H966|And]] ⟨there⟩ [[H4672|they found]] [[H137|Adoni-bezek]] [[H3898|and fought]] [[H5221|against him,  striking down]] [[H3669|the Canaanites]] [[H6522|and Perizzites.]] ^0105

[[H137|As Adoni-bezek]] [[H5127|fled,]] [[H7291|they pursued him,]] [[H270|seized him,]] [[H7112|and cut off]] [[H931|his thumbs]] [[H7272|and big toes.]] ^0106

[[H137|Then Adoni-bezek]] [[H559|said,]] [[H7657|“Seventy]] [[H4428|kings]] [[H931|with their thumbs]] [[H7272|and big toes]] [[H7112|cut off]] [[H3950|have gathered]] ⟨the scraps⟩ [[H8478|under]] [[H7979|my table.]] [[H834|As]] [[H6213|I have done,]] [[H3651|so]] [[H430|God]] [[H7999|has repaid]] [[H935|me.”  And they brought him]] [[H3389|to Jerusalem,]] [[H4191|where he died.]] ^0107

[[H1121|Then the men]] [[H3063|of Judah]] [[H3898|fought]] [[H3389|against Jerusalem]] [[H3920|and captured it.]] [[H5221|They put]] ⟨the city⟩ [[H2719|to the sword]] [[H7971|and set]] [[H5892|it]] [[H784|on fire.]] ^0108

[[H310|Afterward,]] [[H1121|the men]] [[H3063|of Judah]] [[H3381|marched down]] [[H3898|to fight]] [[H3669|against the Canaanites]] [[H3427|living]] [[H2022|in the hill country,]] [[H5045|in the Negev,]] [[H8219|and in the foothills.]] ^0109

[[H3063|Judah]] [[H1980|also marched]] [[H413|against]] [[H3669|the Canaanites]] [[H3427|who were living]] [[H2275|in Hebron]] [[H2275|(]] [[H6440|formerly]] [[H8034|known as]] [[H7153|Kiriath-arba),]] [[H5221|and they struck down]] [[H8344|Sheshai,]] [[H289|Ahiman,]] [[H8526|and Talmai.]] ^0110

[[H8033|From there]] [[H1980|they marched]] [[H413|against]] [[H3427|the residents]] [[H1688|of Debir]] [[H1688|(]] [[H6440|formerly]] [[H8034|known as]] [[H7158|Kiriath-sepher).]] ^0111

[[H3612|And Caleb]] [[H559|said,]] [[H834|“To the man]] [[H5221|who strikes down]] [[H7158|Kiriath-sepher]] [[H3920|and captures it,]] [[H5414|I will give]] [[H1323|my daughter]] [[H5915|Acsah]] [[H802|in marriage.”]] ^0112

[[H6274|So Othniel]] [[H1121|son]] [[H7073|of Kenaz,]] [[H3612|Caleb’s]] [[H6996|younger]] [[H251|brother,]] [[H3920|captured it,]] [[H5414|and Caleb gave]] [[H1323|his daughter]] [[H5915|Acsah]] [[H802|to him  in marriage.]] ^0113

[[H1961|One day]] ⟨Acsah⟩ [[H935|came]] ⟨to Othniel⟩ [[H5496|and urged him]] [[H7592|to ask]] [[H1|her father]] [[H7704|for a field.]] [[H6795|When she got off]] [[H2543|her donkey,]] [[H3612|Caleb]] [[H559|asked her,]] [[H4100|“What]] ^0114

[[H3051|“Give]] [[H1293|me a blessing,”]] [[H559|she answered.]] [[H3588|“Since]] [[H5414|you have given me]] [[H776|land]] [[H5045|in the Negev,]] [[H5414|give]] [[H1543|me  springs]] [[H4325|of water.”]] ⟨as well⟩ [[H3612|So Caleb]] [[H5414|gave]] [[H5942|her both the upper]] [[H8482|and lower]] [[H1543|springs.]] ^0115

[[H1121|Now the descendants]] [[H4872|of Moses’]] [[H2859|father-in-law,]] [[H7017|the Kenite,]] [[H5927|went up]] [[H854|with]] [[H1121|the men]] [[H3063|of Judah]] [[H5892|from the City]] [[H8558|of Palms]] [[H4057|to the Wilderness]] [[H3063|of Judah]] [[H5045|in the Negev]] [[H6166|near Arad.]] [[H1980|They went]] [[H3427|to live]] [[H854|among]] [[H5971|the people.]] ^0116

[[H3063|Then the men of Judah]] [[H1980|went]] [[H854|with]] [[H251|their brothers]] [[H8095|the Simeonites,]] [[H5221|struck]] [[H3669|the Canaanites]] [[H3427|who were living]] [[H6857|in Zephath,]] [[H2763|and completely destroyed]] ⟨the city⟩ [[H853|.]] [[H7121|So was called]] ⟨it⟩ [[H2767|Hormah.]] ^0117

[[H3063|And Judah]] [[H3920|also captured]] [[H5804|Gaza,]] [[H831|Ashkelon,]] [[H6138|and Ekron—]] [[H853|each with]] [[H1366|its territory.]] ^0118

[[H3068|The LORD]] [[H1961|was]] [[H854|with]] [[H3063|Judah,]] [[H3423|and they took possession]] [[H2022|of the hill country;]] [[H3588|but]] [[H3808|they could not]] [[H3423|drive out]] [[H3427|the inhabitants]] [[H6010|of the plains,]] [[H3588|because]] [[H7393|they had  chariots]] [[H1270|of iron.]] ^0119

[[H834|Just as]] [[H4872|Moses]] [[H1696|had promised,]] [[H5414|Judah gave]] [[H2275|Hebron]] [[H3612|to Caleb,]] [[H3423|who drove out]] ⟨the descendants of⟩ [[H7969|the three]] [[H1121|sons]] [[H6061|of Anak.]] ^0120

[[H1121|The Benjamites,]] [[H853|however,]] [[H3808|failed to]] [[H3423|drive out]] [[H2983|the Jebusites]] [[H3427|living]] [[H3389|in Jerusalem.]] [[H5704|And to]] [[H2088|this]] [[H3117|day]] [[H2983|the Jebusites]] [[H3427|dwell]] [[H854|among]] [[H1121|the Benjamites]] [[H3389|in Jerusalem.]] ^0121

[[H1004|The house]] [[H3130|of Joseph]] [[H1571|also]] [[H5927|attacked]] [[H1008|Bethel,]] [[H3068|and the LORD]] [[H5973|was with them.]] ^0122

[[H1004|They]] [[H8446|sent spies]] [[H1008|to Bethel]] [[H5892|(]] [[H6440|formerly]] [[H8034|known as]] [[H3870|Luz),]] ^0123

[[H8104|and when the spies]] [[H7200|saw]] [[H376|a man]] [[H3318|coming out]] [[H4480|of]] [[H5892|the city,]] [[H559|they said]] [[H4994|to him,  “Please]] [[H7200|show]] [[H3996|us how to get into]] [[H5892|the city,]] [[H6213|and we will treat]] [[H5973|you]] [[H2617|kindly.”]] ^0124

[[H7200|So showed them]] ⟨the man⟩ [[H3996|the entrance]] [[H5892|to the city,]] [[H5221|and they put]] [[H5892|the city]] [[H2719|to the sword]] [[H7971|but released]] [[H376|that man]] [[H3605|and all]] [[H4940|his family.]] ^0125

[[H376|And the man]] [[H1980|went]] [[H776|to the land]] [[H2850|of the Hittites,]] [[H1129|built]] [[H5892|a city,]] [[H7121|and called it]] [[H3870|Luz,]] [[H1931|which]] [[H8034|is its name]] [[H5704|to]] [[H2088|this]] [[H3117|day.]] ^0126

[[H4519|At that time Manasseh]] [[H3808|failed]] [[H3423|to drive out the inhabitants]] [[H1052|of Beth-shean,]] [[H8590|Taanach,]] [[H1756|Dor,]] [[H2991|Ibleam,]] ⟨and⟩ [[H853|]] [[H4023|Megiddo,]] [[H1323|or any of their villages;]] [[H3669|for the Canaanites]] [[H2974|were determined]] [[H3427|to dwell]] [[H2063|in this]] [[H776|land.]] ^0127

[[H3588|When]] [[H3478|Israel]] [[H2388|became stronger,]] [[H7760|they pressed]] [[H3669|the Canaanites]] [[H4522|into forced labor,]] [[H3808|but they never]] [[H3423|drove them out]] [[H3423|completely.]] ^0128

[[H669|Ephraim]] [[H3808|also failed]] [[H3423|to drive out]] [[H3669|the Canaanites]] [[H3427|living]] [[H1507|in Gezer;]] [[H3669|so the Canaanites]] [[H3427|continued to dwell]] [[H7130|among them]] [[H1507|in Gezer.]] ^0129

[[H2074|Zebulun]] [[H3808|failed]] [[H3423|to drive out]] [[H3427|the inhabitants]] [[H7003|of Kitron]] ⟨and⟩ [[H853|]] [[H5096|Nahalol;]] [[H3669|so the Canaanites]] [[H3427|lived]] [[H7130|among them]] [[H1961|and served]] [[H4522|as forced laborers.]] ^0130

[[H836|Asher]] [[H3808|failed]] [[H3423|to drive out]] [[H3427|the inhabitants]] [[H5910|of Acco,]] [[H6721|Sidon,]] [[H303|Ahlab,]] [[H392|Achzib,]] [[H2462|Helbah,]] [[H663|Aphik,]] [[H853|and]] [[H7340|Rehob.]] ^0131

[[H843|So the Asherites]] [[H3427|lived]] [[H7130|among]] [[H3669|the Canaanite]] [[H3427|inhabitants]] [[H776|of the land,]] [[H3588|because]] [[H3808|they did not]] [[H3423|drive them out.]] ^0132

[[H5321|Naphtali]] [[H3808|failed]] [[H3423|to drive out]] [[H3427|the inhabitants]] [[H1053|of Beth-shemesh]] [[H853|and]] [[H1043|Beth-anath.]] [[H3427|So also lived]] ⟨the Naphtalites⟩ [[H7130|among]] [[H3669|the Canaanite]] [[H3427|inhabitants]] [[H776|of the land,]] [[H3427|but the inhabitants]] [[H1053|of Beth-shemesh]] [[H1043|and Beth-anath]] [[H1961|served]] [[H4522|them  as forced laborers.]] ^0133

[[H567|The Amorites]] [[H3905|forced]] [[H1121|the Danites]] [[H2022|into the hill country]] [[H3588|and]] [[H3808|did not]] [[H5414|allow]] [[H3381|them to come down]] [[H6010|into the plain.]] ^0134

[[H567|And the Amorites]] [[H2974|were determined]] [[H3427|to dwell]] [[H2022|in Mount]] [[H2776|Heres,]] [[H357|Aijalon,]] [[H8169|and Shaalbim.]] [[H1004|But when the house]] [[H3130|of Joseph]] [[H3513|grew]] [[H3027|in strength,]] [[H1961|they pressed the Amorites]] [[H4522|into forced labor.]] ^0135

[[H1366|And the border]] [[H567|of the Amorites]] ⟨extended⟩ [[H4610|from the Ascent  of Akrabbim]] [[H5553|to Sela]] [[H4605|and beyond.]] ^0136

[[H4397|Now the Angel]] [[H3068|of the LORD]] [[H5927|went up]] [[H4480|from]] [[H1537|Gilgal]] [[H413|to]] [[H1066|Bochim]] [[H559|and said,]] [[H5927|“I brought you up]] [[H4714|out of Egypt]] [[H935|and led]] [[H413|you into]] [[H776|the land]] [[H7650|I had promised]] [[H1|to your fathers,]] [[H559|and I said,]] [[H3808|‘I will never]] [[H6565|break]] [[H1285|My covenant]] [[H854|with you,]] ^0201

[[H859|and you]] [[H3808|are not]] [[H3772|to make]] [[H1285|a covenant]] [[H3427|with the people]] [[H2063|of this]] [[H776|land,]] [[H5422|but you shall tear down]] [[H4196|their altars.’]] [[H3808|Yet you have not]] [[H8085|obeyed Me.]] [[H4100|What]] [[H2063|is this]] [[H6213|you have done?]] ^0202

[[H1571|So now]] [[H559|I tell you]] [[H3808|that I will not]] [[H1644|drive out]] ⟨these people⟩ [[H6440|before you;]] [[H1961|they will be]] ⟨thorns⟩ [[H6654|in your  sides,]] [[H430|and their gods]] [[H1961|will be]] [[H4170|a snare]] ^0203

[[H4397|When the Angel]] [[H3068|of the LORD]] [[H1696|had spoken]] [[H428|these]] [[H1697|words]] [[H413|to]] [[H3605|all]] [[H1121|the Israelites,]] [[H5971|the people]] [[H5375|lifted up]] [[H6963|their voices]] [[H1058|and wept.]] ^0204

[[H7121|So they called]] [[H1931|that]] [[H4725|place]] [[H1066|Bochim]] [[H2076|and offered sacrifices]] [[H8033|there]] [[H3068|to the LORD.]] ^0205

[[H3091|After Joshua]] [[H7971|had dismissed]] [[H5971|the people,]] [[H1121|the Israelites]] [[H1980|went out]] [[H3423|to take possession of]] [[H776|the land,]] [[H376|each]] [[H5159|to his own inheritance.]] ^0206

[[H5971|And the people]] [[H5647|served]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H3605|all]] [[H3117|the days]] [[H3091|of Joshua]] ⟨and⟩ [[H3605|]] [[H2205|of the elders]] [[H834|who]] [[H748|outlived]] ⟨him⟩ [[H3091|]] ⟨and⟩ [[H834|]] [[H7200|had seen]] [[H3605|all]] [[H1419|the great]] [[H4639|works]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H6213|had done]] [[H3478|for Israel.]] ^0207

[[H3091|And Joshua]] [[H1121|son]] [[H5126|of Nun,]] [[H5650|the servant]] [[H3068|of the LORD,]] [[H4191|died]] [[H1121|at the age]] [[H3967|of 110.]] ^0208

[[H6912|They buried]] [[H1366|him in the land]] [[H5159|of his inheritance,]] [[H8556|at Timnath-heres]] [[H2022|in the hill country]] [[H669|of Ephraim,]] [[H6828|north]] [[H2022|of Mount]] [[H1608|Gaash.]] ^0209

[[H310|After]] [[H1931|that]] [[H3605|whole]] [[H1755|generation]] [[H1571|had also]] [[H622|been gathered]] [[H413|to]] [[H1|their fathers,]] [[H312|another]] [[H1755|generation]] [[H6965|rose up,]] [[H834|who]] [[H3808|did not]] [[H3045|know]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H1571|or]] [[H4639|the works]] [[H6213|He had done]] [[H3478|for Israel.]] ^0210

[[H1121|And the Israelites]] [[H6213|did]] [[H7451|evil]] [[H5869|in the sight]] [[H3068|of the LORD]] [[H5647|and served]] [[H1168|the Baals.]] ^0211

[[H5800|Thus they forsook]] [[H3068|the LORD,]] [[H430|the God]] [[H1|of their fathers,]] [[H3318|who had brought them]] [[H776|out of the land]] [[H4714|of Egypt,]] [[H1980|and they followed]] [[H310|after]] [[H312|various]] [[H430|gods]] [[H5971|of the people]] [[H5439|all around them.]] [[H7812|They bowed down]] [[H3707|to them  and provoked]] [[H3068|the LORD]] ⟨to anger⟩, ^0212

[[H5800|for they forsook]] [[H3068|Him]] [[H5647|and served]] [[H1168|Baal]] [[H6252|and the Ashtoreths.]] ^0213

[[H639|Then the anger]] [[H3068|of the LORD]] [[H2734|burned]] [[H3478|against Israel,]] [[H5414|and He handed them over to]] [[H8154|raiders]] [[H8155|who plundered]] [[H853|them.]] [[H4376|He sold them]] [[H3027|into the hands]] [[H341|of their enemies]] [[H5439|all around,]] [[H3201|whom they were]] [[H3808|no]] [[H5750|longer]] [[H5975|able to resist.]] ^0214

[[H3605|Wherever]] ⟨Israel⟩ [[H3318|marched out,]] [[H3027|the hand]] [[H3068|of the LORD]] [[H1961|was]] [[H7451|against them  to bring calamity,]] [[H834|just as]] [[H3068|He]] [[H7650|had sworn]] [[H3334|to them.  So they were greatly distressed.]] ^0215

[[H3068|Then the LORD]] [[H6965|raised up]] [[H8199|judges,]] [[H3467|who delivered them]] [[H3027|from the hands]] [[H8154|of these raiders.]] ^0216

⟨Israel,⟩ [[H1571|however,]] [[H3808|did not]] [[H8085|listen]] [[H413|to]] [[H8199|their judges.]] [[H3588|Instead,]] [[H2181|they prostituted]] [[H310|themselves with]] [[H312|other]] [[H430|gods]] [[H7812|and bowed down]] [[H4118|to them.  They quickly]] [[H5493|turned]] [[H4480|from]] [[H1870|the way]] [[H1|of their fathers,]] [[H1980|who had walked]] [[H8085|in obedience]] [[H3068|to the LORD’s]] [[H4687|commandments;]] [[H3808|they did not]] [[H6213|do as their fathers]] ⟨had done⟩. ^0217

[[H3588|Whenever]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H6965|raised up]] [[H8199|a judge]] [[H3068|for the Israelites,]] ⟨He⟩ [[H1961|was]] [[H5973|with]] [[H8199|that judge]] [[H3467|and delivered them]] [[H3027|from the hands]] [[H341|of their enemies]] [[H8199|while the judge]] [[H3605|was still alive;]] [[H3068|for the LORD]] [[H5162|was moved to pity]] [[H5009|by their groaning]] [[H6440|under those]] [[H3905|who oppressed]] [[H1766|and afflicted them.]] ^0218

[[H1961|But when]] [[H8199|the judge]] [[H4191|died,]] [[H7843|the Israelites became even more corrupt]] [[H1|than their fathers,]] [[H1980|going]] [[H310|after]] [[H312|other]] [[H430|gods]] [[H5647|to serve them]] [[H7812|and bow down]] [[H3808|to them.  They would not]] [[H5307|turn]] [[H4611|from their evil practices]] [[H7186|and stubborn]] [[H1870|ways.]] ^0219

[[H639|So the anger]] [[H3068|of the LORD]] [[H2734|burned]] [[H3478|against Israel,]] [[H559|and He said,]] [[H3282|“Because]] [[H2088|this]] [[H1471|nation]] [[H5674|has transgressed]] [[H1285|the covenant]] [[H6680|I laid down]] [[H1|for their fathers]] [[H3808|and has not]] [[H8085|heeded]] [[H6963|My voice,]] ^0220

[[H589|I]] [[H3808|will no]] [[H3254|longer]] [[H3423|drive out]] [[H4480|before them]] [[H376|any]] [[H1471|of the nations]] [[H3091|Joshua]] [[H5800|left]] [[H4191|when he died.]] ^0221

[[H4616|In this way]] [[H5254|I will test]] [[H518|whether]] [[H3478|Israel]] [[H8104|will keep]] [[H1870|the way]] [[H3068|of the LORD]] [[H1980|by walking in it]] [[H834|as]] [[H1|their fathers did.”]] ^0222

[[H3068|That is why the LORD]] [[H428|had left those]] [[H1471|nations]] [[H3240|in place]] [[H1115|and had not]] [[H3423|driven them out]] [[H4118|immediately]] [[H5414|by delivering them]] [[H3027|into the hand]] [[H3091|of Joshua.]] ^0223

[[H2568|the five]] [[H5633|rulers]] [[H6430|of the Philistines,]] [[H3605|all]] [[H3669|the Canaanites,]] [[H6722|the Sidonians,]] [[H2340|and the Hivites]] [[H3427|who lived]] [[H2022|in the mountains]] [[H3844|of Lebanon]] [[H2022|from Mount]] [[H1179|Baal-hermon]] [[H2574|to Lebo-hamath.]] ^0303

⟨These nations⟩ [[H1961|were]] ⟨left⟩ [[H5254|to test]] [[H3478|the Israelites,]] [[H3045|to find out]] [[H8085|whether they would keep]] [[H4687|the commandments]] [[H3068|of the LORD,]] [[H834|which]] [[H6680|He had given]] [[H1|their fathers]] [[H3027|through]] [[H4872|Moses.]] ^0304

[[H1121|Thus the Israelites]] [[H3427|continued to live]] [[H7130|among]] [[H3669|the Canaanites,]] [[H2850|Hittites,]] [[H567|Amorites,]] [[H6522|Perizzites,]] [[H2340|Hivites,]] [[H2983|and Jebusites.]] ^0305

[[H3947|And they took]] [[H1323|the daughters]] ⟨of these people⟩ [[H802|in marriage,]] [[H5414|gave]] [[H1323|their own daughters]] [[H1121|to their sons,]] [[H5647|and served]] [[H430|their gods.]] ^0306

[[H1121|So the Israelites]] [[H6213|did]] [[H7451|evil]] [[H5869|in the sight]] [[H3068|of the LORD;]] [[H7911|they forgot]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H430|their God]] [[H5647|and served]] [[H1168|the Baals]] [[H842|and the Asherahs.]] ^0307

[[H639|Then the anger]] [[H3068|of the LORD]] [[H2734|burned]] [[H3478|against Israel,]] [[H4376|and He sold them]] [[H3027|into the hands]] [[H3573|of  Cushan-rishathaim]] [[H4428|king]] [[H763|of Mesopotamia,]] [[H1121|and the Israelites]] [[H5647|served]] [[H3573|him]] [[H8083|eight]] [[H8141|years.]] ^0308

[[H1121|But when the Israelites]] [[H2199|cried out]] [[H413|to]] [[H3068|the LORD,]] ⟨He⟩ [[H3068|]] [[H6965|raised up]] [[H6274|Othniel]] [[H1121|son]] [[H7073|of Kenaz,]] [[H3612|Caleb’s]] [[H6996|youngest]] [[H251|brother,]] [[H3467|as a deliverer]] [[H3467|to save]] ⟨them⟩ [[H1121|.]] ^0309

[[H7307|The Spirit]] [[H3068|of the LORD]] [[H1961|came]] [[H5921|upon him,]] [[H3478|and he became Israel's]] [[H8199|judge]] [[H3318|and went out]] [[H4421|to war.]] [[H3068|And the LORD]] [[H5414|delivered]] [[H3573|Cushan-rishathaim]] [[H4428|king]] [[H758|of Aram]] [[H3027|into the hands]] ⟨of Othniel⟩, [[H5810|who prevailed]] [[H5921|against]] [[H3573|him.]] ^0310

[[H776|So the land]] [[H8252|had rest]] [[H705|for forty]] [[H8141|years,]] [[H6274|until Othniel]] [[H1121|son]] [[H7073|of Kenaz]] [[H4191|died.]] ^0311

[[H1121|After enlisting the Ammonites]] [[H6002|and Amalekites]] [[H622|to join forces]] [[H413|with him,]] ⟨Eglon⟩ [[H1980|attacked]] [[H5221|and defeated]] [[H3478|Israel,]] [[H3423|taking possession of]] [[H5892|the City]] [[H8558|of Palms.]] ^0313

[[H1121|The Israelites]] [[H5647|served]] [[H5700|Eglon]] [[H4428|king]] [[H4124|of Moab]] [[H8083|eighteen]] [[H8141|years.]] ^0314

[[H1121|And again]] ⟨they⟩ [[H2199|cried out]] [[H413|to]] [[H3068|the LORD,]] [[H3068|and He]] [[H6965|raised up]] [[H164|Ehud]] [[H1121|son]] [[H1617|of Gera,]] [[H334|a left-handed]] [[H1121|Benjamite,]] [[H3467|as their deliverer.]] [[H3478|So]] ⟨they⟩ [[H7971|sent]] [[H3027|him]] [[H4503|with tribute]] [[H5700|to Eglon]] [[H4428|king]] [[H4124|of Moab.]] ^0315

[[H164|Now Ehud]] [[H6213|had made]] [[H8147|for himself  a double-edged]] [[H2719|sword]] [[H1574|a cubit]] [[H753|long.]] [[H2296|He strapped]] [[H5921|it to]] [[H3225|his right]] [[H3409|thigh]] [[H8478|under]] [[H4055|his cloak]] ^0316

[[H7126|and brought]] [[H4503|the tribute]] [[H5700|to Eglon]] [[H4428|king]] [[H4124|of Moab,]] [[H5700|who]] [[H3966|was an obese]] [[H376|man.]] ^0317

[[H834|After]] [[H3615|Ehud had finished]] [[H7126|presenting]] [[H4503|the tribute,]] [[H7971|he ushered out]] [[H5971|those]] [[H5375|who had carried]] [[H4503|it.]] ^0318

[[H4480|But upon reaching]] [[H6456|the idols]] [[H854|near]] [[H1537|Gilgal,]] [[H1931|he himself]] [[H7725|turned back]] [[H559|and said,]] [[H5643|“I have a secret]] [[H1697|message]] [[H413|for you,]] [[H4428|O king.”]] [[H2013|“Silence,”]] [[H559|said the king,]] [[H3605|and all]] [[H5975|his attendants]] [[H3318|left him.]] ^0319

[[H164|Then Ehud]] [[H935|approached]] [[H1931|him while he]] [[H3427|was sitting]] [[H905|alone]] [[H4747|in the coolness of]] [[H5944|his upper room.]] [[H1697|“I have a word]] [[H430|from God]] [[H413|for you,”]] [[H164|Ehud]] [[H559|said,]] [[H6965|and the king rose]] [[H5921|from]] ⟨his⟩ [[H3678|seat.]] ^0320

[[H164|And Ehud]] [[H7971|reached]] [[H8040|with his left]] [[H3027|hand,]] [[H3947|pulled]] [[H2719|the sword]] [[H5921|from]] [[H3225|his right]] [[H3409|thigh,]] [[H8628|and plunged]] [[H990|it into Eglon’s belly.]] ^0321

[[H1571|Even]] [[H5325|the handle]] [[H935|sank in]] [[H310|after]] [[H3851|the blade,]] [[H2459|and Eglon’s fat]] [[H5462|closed in]] [[H1157|over]] [[H3851|it,]] [[H3588|so that]] [[H3808|Ehud did not]] [[H8025|withdraw]] [[H2719|the sword]] [[H990|from his belly.]] [[H6574|And Eglon’s bowels]] [[H3318|emptied.]] ^0322

[[H164|Then Ehud]] [[H3318|went out]] [[H4528|through the porch,]] [[H5462|closing]] [[H5274|and locking]] [[H1817|the doors]] [[H5944|of the upper room]] [[H5774|behind him.]] ^0323

[[H1931|After Ehud]] [[H3318|was gone,]] [[H5650|Eglon’s servants]] [[H935|came in]] [[H2009|and found]] [[H1817|the doors]] [[H5944|of the upstairs room]] [[H5274|locked.]] [[H1931|“He must be]] [[H5526|relieving]] [[H4747|himself in the cool]] [[H2315|room,”]] [[H559|they said.]] ^0324

[[H2342|So they waited]] [[H5704|until]] [[H954|they became worried]] [[H2009|and saw]] [[H369|that he had still not]] [[H6605|opened]] [[H1817|the doors]] [[H5944|of the upper room.]] [[H3947|Then they took]] [[H4668|the key]] [[H6605|and opened —]] ⟨the doors⟩ [[H2009|and there]] [[H113|was their lord]] [[H5307|lying]] [[H4191|dead]] [[H776|on the floor.]] ^0325

[[H164|Ehud, however,]] [[H4422|had escaped]] [[H5704|while]] [[H4102|the servants waited.]] [[H1931|He]] [[H5674|passed by]] [[H6456|the idols]] [[H4422|and escaped]] [[H8167|to Seirah.]] ^0326

[[H935|On arriving]] ⟨in Seirah⟩, [[H8628|he blew]] [[H7782|the trumpet]] [[H2022|throughout the hill country]] [[H669|of Ephraim.]] [[H1121|The Israelites]] [[H3381|came down]] [[H5973|with him]] [[H4480|from]] [[H2022|the hills,]] [[H1931|and he became their leader.]] ^0327

[[H7291|“Follow me,”]] [[H559|he told them,]] [[H3588|“for]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H5414|has delivered]] [[H341|your enemies]] [[H4124|the Moabites]] [[H3027|into your hands.”]] [[H3381|So they followed him down]] [[H3920|and seized]] [[H4569|the fords]] [[H3383|of the Jordan]] [[H4124|leading to Moab,]] [[H3808|and did not]] [[H5414|allow]] [[H376|anyone]] [[H5674|to cross over.]] ^0328

[[H1931|At that]] [[H6256|time]] [[H5221|they struck down]] [[H6235|about ten]] [[H505|thousand]] [[H4124|Moabites,]] [[H3605|all]] [[H8082|robust]] [[H2428|and valiant]] [[H376|men.]] [[H3808|Not]] [[H376|one]] [[H4422|of them escaped.]] ^0329

[[H4124|So Moab]] [[H3665|was subdued]] [[H8478|under]] [[H3027|the hand]] [[H3478|of Israel]] [[H1931|that]] [[H3117|day,]] [[H776|and the land]] [[H8252|had rest]] [[H8084|for eighty]] [[H8141|years.]] ^0330

[[H310|After Ehud]] [[H1961|came]] [[H8044|Shamgar]] [[H1121|son]] [[H6067|of Anath.]] [[H1931|And he too]] [[H3467|delivered]] [[H3478|Israel,]] [[H5221|striking down]] [[H8337|six]] [[H3967|hundred]] [[H6430|Philistines]] [[H4451|with an oxgoad.]] ^0331

[[H164|After Ehud]] [[H4191|died,]] [[H1121|the Israelites]] [[H3254|again]] [[H6213|did]] [[H7451|evil]] [[H5869|in the sight]] [[H3068|of the LORD.]] ^0401

[[H3068|So the LORD]] [[H4376|sold them]] [[H3027|into the hands]] [[H2985|of Jabin]] [[H4428|king]] [[H3667|of Canaan,]] [[H834|who]] [[H4427|reigned]] [[H2674|in Hazor.]] [[H8269|The commander]] [[H6635|of his forces]] [[H5516|was Sisera,]] [[H1931|who]] [[H3427|lived]] [[H2800|in Harosheth-hagoyim.]] ^0402

[[H1121|Then the Israelites]] [[H6817|cried out]] [[H413|to]] [[H3068|the LORD,]] [[H3588|because]] [[H8672|Jabin had  nine]] [[H3967|hundred]] [[H7393|chariots]] [[H1270|of iron,]] [[H1931|and he]] [[H2394|had harshly]] [[H3905|oppressed]] [[H1121|the Israelites]] [[H6242|for twenty]] [[H8141|years.]] ^0403

[[H1683|Now Deborah,]] [[H5031|a prophetess,]] [[H802|the wife]] [[H3941|of Lappidoth,]] [[H8199|was judging]] [[H3478|Israel]] [[H1931|at that]] [[H6256|time.]] ^0404

[[H7971|She summoned]] [[H1301|Barak]] [[H1121|son]] [[H42|of Abinoam]] [[H6943|from Kedesh]] [[H5321|in Naphtali]] [[H559|and said]] [[H413|to him,]] [[H3808|“Has not]] [[H3068|the LORD,]] [[H430|the God]] [[H3478|of Israel,]] [[H6680|commanded you:]] [[H1980|‘Go,]] [[H4900|and march]] [[H2022|to Mount]] [[H8396|Tabor,]] [[H3947|taking]] [[H5973|with you]] [[H6235|ten]] [[H505|thousand]] [[H376|men]] [[H5321|of Naphtali]] [[H2074|and Zebulun?]] ^0406

[[H1980|“I will certainly go]] [[H5973|with you,”]] [[H559|Deborah replied,]] [[H657|“but]] [[H1870|the road]] [[H859|you]] ⟨are taking⟩ [[H1961|will bring you]] [[H3808|no]] [[H8597|honor,]] [[H3588|because]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H4376|will be selling]] [[H5516|Sisera]] [[H3027|into the hand]] [[H802|of a woman.”]] [[H1683|So Deborah]] [[H6965|got up]] [[H1980|and went]] [[H5973|with]] [[H1301|Barak]] [[H6943|to Kedesh,]] ^0409

[[H376|When the men]] [[H5892|of the city]] [[H7925|got up]] [[H1242|in the morning,]] [[H2009|they found]] [[H1168|Baal’s]] [[H4196|altar]] [[H5422|torn down,]] [[H842|the Asherah pole]] [[H5921|beside]] [[H3772|it cut down,]] [[H8145|and the second]] [[H6499|bull]] [[H5927|offered up]] [[H5921|on]] [[H1129|the newly built]] [[H4196|altar.]] ^0628

[[H4310|“Who]] [[H6213|did]] [[H2088|this?”]] [[H559|they said]] [[H413|to]] [[H376|one]] [[H7453|another.]] [[H1875|And after they had investigated thoroughly,]] [[H559|they were told,]] [[H1439|“Gideon]] [[H1121|son]] [[H3101|of Joash]] [[H6213|did]] [[H2088|it.”]] ^0629

[[H376|Then the men]] [[H5892|of the city]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H3101|Joash,]] [[H3318|“Bring out]] [[H1121|your son.]] [[H4191|He must die,]] [[H3588|because]] [[H5422|he has torn down]] [[H1168|Baal’s]] [[H4196|altar]] [[H3772|and cut down]] [[H842|the Asherah pole]] [[H5921|beside it.”]] ^0630

[[H3101|But Joash]] [[H559|said]] [[H3605|to all]] [[H834|who]] [[H5975|stood]] [[H5921|against him,]] [[H859|“Are you]] [[H7378|contending]] [[H1168|for Baal?]] [[H859|Are you]] [[H3467|trying to save him?]] [[H834|Whoever]] [[H7378|pleads his case]] [[H4191|will be put to death]] [[H5704|by]] [[H1242|morning!]] [[H518|If]] ⟨Baal⟩ [[H1931|]] [[H430|is a god,]] [[H7378|let him contend]] [[H3588|for himself  if]] [[H5422|someone has torn down]] [[H4196|his altar.]] ^0631

[[H3117|So on that day]] [[H7121|Gideon was called]] [[H3378|Jerubbaal,]] [[H559|that is to say,]] [[H1168|“Let Baal]] [[H7378|contend]] [[H3588|with him,”  because]] [[H5422|he had torn down]] [[H4196|his altar.]] ^0632

[[H3605|Then all]] [[H4080|the Midianites,]] [[H6002|Amalekites,]] [[H1121|and other people]] [[H6924|of the East]] [[H622|gathered]] [[H3162|together,]] [[H5674|crossed over]] ⟨the Jordan⟩, [[H2583|and camped]] [[H6010|in the Valley]] [[H3157|of Jezreel.]] ^0633

[[H7307|So the Spirit]] [[H3068|of the LORD]] [[H3847|came upon]] [[H1439|Gideon,]] [[H8628|and he blew]] [[H7782|the trumpet]] [[H2199|and rallied]] [[H44|the Abiezrites]] [[H310|behind him.]] ^0634

[[H2199|Calling]] [[H310|them to arms,]] ⟨Gideon⟩ [[H7971|sent]] [[H4397|messengers]] [[H3605|throughout]] [[H4519|Manasseh,]] [[H1571|as well as]] [[H836|Asher,]] [[H2074|Zebulun,]] [[H5321|and Naphtali,]] [[H5927|so that they came up]] [[H7125|to meet him.]] ^0635

[[H1439|Then Gideon]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H430|God,]] [[H518|“If]] [[H3467|You will deliver]] [[H3478|Israel]] [[H3027|by my hand,]] [[H834|as]] [[H1696|You have said,]] ^0636

[[H2009|then behold,]] [[H595|I]] [[H3322|will place]] [[H1492|a fleece]] [[H6785|of wool]] [[H1637|on the threshing floor.]] [[H518|If]] [[H1961|there is]] [[H2919|dew]] [[H905|only]] [[H5921|on]] [[H1492|the fleece]] [[H3605|and all]] [[H776|the ground]] [[H2721|is dry,]] [[H3045|then I will know]] [[H3588|that]] [[H3467|You will deliver]] [[H3478|Israel]] [[H3027|by my hand,]] [[H834|as]] [[H1696|You have said.]] ^0637

[[H3651|And that is what]] [[H1961|happened.]] [[H7925|When arose]] ⟨Gideon⟩ [[H4283|the next morning,]] [[H2115|he squeezed]] [[H1492|the fleece]] [[H4680|and wrung]] [[H4480|out]] [[H2919|the dew—]] [[H5602|a bowlful]] [[H4325|of water.]] ^0638

[[H1439|Then Gideon]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H430|God,]] [[H408|“Do not]] [[H2734|be angry]] [[H1696|with me;  let me speak]] [[H389|one more time.]] [[H4994|Please allow me]] [[H6471|one more]] [[H5254|test]] [[H1492|with the fleece.]] [[H4994|This time]] [[H1961|let it be]] [[H2721|dry,]] [[H776|and the ground]] [[H1961|be]] [[H3605|covered]] [[H2919|with dew.”]] ^0639

[[H1931|And that]] [[H3915|night]] [[H430|God]] [[H6213|did]] [[H3651|so.]] [[H905|Only]] [[H1492|the fleece]] [[H1961|was]] [[H2721|dry,]] [[H2919|and dew]] [[H1961|covered]] [[H776|the ground.]] ^0640

[[H7925|Early in the morning]] [[H3378|Jerubbaal]] [[H1931|(that is,]] [[H1439|Gideon)]] [[H3605|and all]] [[H5971|the men]] [[H854|with him]] [[H2583|camped]] [[H5921|beside]] [[H5878|the spring of Harod.]] [[H4264|And the camp]] [[H4080|of Midian]] [[H1961|was]] [[H6828|north]] [[H6010|of them  in the valley]] [[H1389|near the hill]] [[H4176|of Moreh.]] ^0701

[[H3068|The LORD]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H1439|Gideon,]] [[H854|“You have]] [[H7227|too many]] [[H5971|people]] [[H5414|for Me to deliver]] [[H4080|Midian]] [[H3027|into their hands,]] [[H6435|lest]] [[H3478|Israel]] [[H6286|glorify themselves]] [[H5921|over Me,]] [[H559|saying,]] [[H3027|‘My own hand]] [[H3467|has delivered]] ^0702

[[H6258|Now, therefore,]] [[H7121|proclaim]] [[H241|in the hearing]] [[H5971|of the people:]] [[H4310|‘Whoever]] [[H3373|is fearful]] [[H2730|and trembling]] [[H7725|may turn back]] [[H6852|and leave]] [[H2022|Mount]] [[H1568|Gilead.’”]] [[H6242|So twenty-two]] [[H505|thousand]] ⟨of them⟩ [[H5971|]] [[H7725|turned back,]] [[H6235|but ten]] [[H505|thousand]] [[H7604|remained.]] ^0703

[[H1931|Then]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H1439|Gideon,]] [[H5750|“There are still]] [[H7227|too many]] [[H5971|people.]] [[H3381|Take them down]] [[H413|to]] [[H4325|the water,]] [[H6884|and I will sift them]] [[H8033|for you  there.]] [[H834|If]] [[H559|I say]] [[H413|to you,]] [[H2088|‘This]] ⟨one⟩ [[H1980|shall go]] [[H854|with you,’]] [[H1980|he shall go.]] [[H834|But if]] [[H559|I say,]] [[H2088|‘This]] ⟨one⟩ [[H3808|shall not]] [[H1980|go]] [[H5973|with you,’]] [[H1931|he]] [[H3808|shall not]] [[H1980|go.]] ^0704

[[H5971|So brought the people]] ⟨Gideon⟩ [[H3381|down]] [[H413|to]] [[H4325|the water,]] [[H3068|and the LORD]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] ⟨him⟩ [[H1439|,]] [[H3322|“Separate]] [[H3605|those]] [[H834|who]] [[H3952|lap]] [[H4325|the water]] [[H3956|with their tongues]] [[H834|like]] [[H3611|a dog]] [[H3605|from those]] [[H834|who]] [[H3766|kneel]] [[H8354|to drink.”]] ^0705

[[H4557|And the number]] [[H3952|of those who lapped]] ⟨the water⟩ [[H3027|with their hands]] [[H413|to]] [[H6310|their mouths]] [[H1961|was]] [[H7969|three]] [[H3967|hundred]] [[H376|men;]] [[H3605|all]] [[H3499|the others]] [[H3766|knelt]] [[H8354|to drink.]] ^0706

[[H3068|Then the LORD]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H1439|Gideon,]] [[H7969|“With the three]] [[H3967|hundred]] [[H376|men]] [[H3952|who lapped]] ⟨the water⟩ [[H3467|I will save]] [[H853|you]] [[H5414|and deliver]] [[H4080|the Midianites]] [[H3027|into your hands.]] [[H3605|But all the others]] [[H1980|are to go]] [[H4725|home.”]] ^0707

[[H7971|So Gideon sent]] [[H3605|the rest of]] [[H376|the Israelites]] [[H168|to their tents]] [[H2388|but kept]] [[H7969|the three]] [[H3967|hundred]] [[H376|men,]] [[H3947|who took]] [[H3027|charge of]] [[H6720|the provisions]] [[H7782|and trumpets]] [[H5971|of the others.]] [[H853|And]] [[H4264|the camp]] [[H4080|of Midian]] [[H1961|lay]] [[H8478|below]] [[H6010|him  in the valley.]] ^0708

[[H1931|That]] [[H3915|night]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] ⟨Gideon⟩, [[H6965|“Get up]] ⟨and⟩ [[H3381|go down]] [[H4264|against the camp,]] [[H3588|for]] [[H5414|I have given]] [[H3027|it into your hands.]] ^0709

[[H518|But if]] [[H859|you]] [[H3373|are afraid]] [[H3381|to]] ⟨do so⟩, [[H3381|then go down]] [[H413|to]] [[H4264|the camp]] [[H5288|with your servant]] [[H6513|Purah]] ^0710

[[H8085|and listen]] [[H4100|to what]] [[H1696|they are saying.]] [[H310|Then]] [[H3027|your hands]] [[H2388|will be strengthened]] [[H3381|to attack]] [[H4264|the camp.”]] [[H1931|So he]] [[H3381|went]] [[H6513|with Purah]] [[H5288|his servant]] [[H413|to]] [[H7097|the outposts]] [[H2571|where armed men]] [[H834|were]] ⟨guarding⟩ [[H4264|the camp.]] ^0711

[[H4080|Now the Midianites,]] [[H6002|Amalekites,]] [[H3605|and all]] [[H1121|the other people]] [[H6924|of the East]] [[H5307|had settled]] [[H6010|in the valley]] [[H7230|like a swarm of]] [[H697|locusts,]] [[H1581|and their camels]] [[H369|were as innumerable]] [[H2344|as the sand]] [[H5921|on]] [[H8193|the seashore.]] ^0712

[[H1439|And as Gideon]] [[H935|arrived,]] [[H376|a man]] [[H5608|was telling]] [[H7453|his friend]] [[H2472|about a dream.]] [[H2009|“Behold,]] [[H2472|I had a dream,”]] [[H559|he said,]] [[H2009|“and I saw]] [[H6742|a loaf]] [[H8184|of barley]] [[H3899|bread]] [[H935|come]] [[H2015|tumbling]] [[H4080|into the Midianite]] [[H4264|camp.]] [[H5221|It struck]] [[H168|the tent]] [[H5307|so hard that]] [[H168|the tent]] [[H2015|overturned]] [[H5307|and collapsed.”]] ^0713

[[H7453|His friend]] [[H6030|replied:]] [[H2063|“This]] [[H369|is nothing]] [[H1115|less than]] [[H2719|the sword]] [[H1439|of Gideon]] [[H1121|son]] [[H3101|of Joash,]] [[H376|the Israelite.]] [[H430|God]] [[H5414|has delivered]] [[H4080|Midian]] [[H853|and]] [[H3605|the whole]] [[H4264|camp]] [[H3027|into his hands.”]] ^0714

[[H1439|When Gideon]] [[H8085|heard]] [[H2472|the dream]] [[H7667|and its interpretation,]] [[H7812|he bowed in worship.]] [[H7725|He returned]] [[H413|to]] [[H4264|the camp]] [[H3478|of Israel]] [[H559|and said,]] [[H6965|“Get up,]] [[H3588|for]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H5414|has delivered]] [[H4264|the camp]] [[H4080|of Midian]] [[H3027|into your hands.”]] ^0715

[[H2673|And he divided]] [[H7969|the three]] [[H3967|hundred]] [[H376|men]] [[H7969|into three]] [[H7218|companies]] [[H5414|and gave]] [[H3605|each man]] [[H7782|a trumpet]] [[H3027|in one hand]] [[H3537|and a large jar]] ⟨in the other⟩, [[H8432|containing]] [[H3940|a torch.]] ^0716

[[H7200|“Watch me]] [[H6213|and do]] [[H3651|as I do,”]] ⟨Gideon⟩ [[H559|said.]] [[H595|“When I]] [[H935|come]] [[H7097|to the outskirts]] [[H4264|of the camp,]] [[H6213|do]] [[H834|exactly as]] [[H6213|I do.]] ^0717

[[H595|When I]] [[H3605|and all]] [[H834|who]] ⟨are⟩ [[H854|with me]] [[H8628|blow]] [[H7782|our trumpets,]] [[H859|then you]] [[H1571|are also]] [[H8628|to blow]] [[H7782|your trumpets]] [[H3605|from all]] [[H5439|around]] [[H4264|the camp]] [[H559|and shout,]] [[H3068|‘For the LORD]] [[H1439|and for Gideon!’”]] ^0718

[[H1439|Gideon]] [[H3967|and the hundred]] [[H376|men]] [[H854|with him]] [[H935|reached]] [[H7097|the outskirts]] [[H4264|of the camp]] [[H7218|at the beginning]] [[H8484|of the middle]] [[H821|watch,]] [[H389|just after]] [[H6965|the changing]] [[H8104|of the guard.]] [[H8628|They blew]] [[H7782|their trumpets]] [[H5310|and broke]] [[H3537|the jars]] [[H834|that]] ⟨were⟩ [[H3027|in their hands.]] ^0719

[[H7969|The three]] [[H7218|companies]] [[H8628|blew]] [[H7782|their trumpets]] [[H7665|and shattered]] [[H3537|their jars.]] [[H2388|Holding]] [[H3940|the torches]] [[H8040|in their left]] [[H3027|hands]] [[H7782|and the trumpets]] [[H3225|in their right]] [[H3027|hands,]] [[H7121|they shouted,]] [[H2719|“A sword]] [[H3068|for the LORD]] [[H1439|and for Gideon!”]] ^0720

[[H376|Each]] ⟨Israelite⟩ [[H5975|took]] [[H8478|his position]] [[H5439|around]] [[H4264|the camp,]] [[H3605|and the entire]] [[H4264|Midianite army]] [[H7323|fled,]] [[H7321|crying out]] [[H5127|as they ran.]] ^0721

[[H7969|And when the three]] [[H3967|hundred]] [[H7782|trumpets]] [[H8628|sounded,]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H7760|set]] [[H2719|the swords]] [[H376|of every man]] [[H4264|in the camp]] [[H7453|against each other.]] [[H4264|The army]] [[H5127|fled]] [[H5704|to]] [[H1029|Beth-shittah]] [[H6888|toward Zererah]] [[H5704|as]] [[H8193|far as the border]] [[H65|of Abel-meholah]] [[H5921|near]] [[H2888|Tabbath.]] ^0722

[[H376|Then the men]] [[H3478|of Israel]] [[H6817|were called out]] [[H4480|from]] [[H5321|Naphtali,]] [[H836|Asher,]] [[H4480|and]] [[H3605|all]] [[H4519|Manasseh,]] [[H7291|and they pursued]] [[H4080|the Midianites.]] ^0723

[[H1439|Gideon]] [[H7971|sent]] [[H4397|messengers]] [[H3605|throughout]] [[H2022|the hill country]] [[H669|of Ephraim]] [[H559|to say,]] [[H3381|“Come down]] [[H7125|against]] [[H4080|the Midianites]] [[H3920|and seize]] [[H4325|the waters]] [[H3383|of the Jordan]] [[H5704|ahead of them  as far as]] [[H1012|Beth-barah.”]] [[H3605|So all]] [[H376|the men]] [[H669|of Ephraim]] [[H6817|were called out,]] [[H3920|and they captured]] [[H4325|the waters]] [[H3383|of the Jordan]] [[H5704|as]] [[H1012|far as Beth-barah.]] ^0724

[[H3920|They also captured]] [[H6159|Oreb]] [[H2062|and Zeeb,]] [[H8147|the two]] [[H8269|princes]] [[H4080|of Midian;]] [[H2026|and they killed]] [[H6159|Oreb]] [[H6697|at the rock]] [[H6159|of Oreb]] [[H2062|and Zeeb]] [[H2062|at the winepress of Zeeb.]] [[H7291|So they pursued]] [[H4080|the Midianites]] ⟨and⟩ [[H935|brought]] [[H7218|the heads]] [[H6159|of Oreb]] [[H2062|and Zeeb]] [[H413|to]] [[H1439|Gideon]] [[H5676|on the other side]] [[H3383|of the Jordan.]] ^0725

[[H376|Then the men]] [[H669|of Ephraim]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] ⟨Gideon⟩, [[H4100|“Why]] [[H6213|have you done]] [[H2088|this]] [[H1115|to us?

[[H1571|So]] ⟨Gideon⟩ [[H559|told]] [[H376|the men]] [[H6439|of Penuel,]] [[H7725|“When I return]] [[H7965|in triumph,]] [[H5422|I will tear down]] [[H2088|this]] [[H4026|tower!”]] ^0809

[[H2078|Now Zebah]] [[H6759|and Zalmunna]] [[H7174|were in Karkor]] [[H5973|with]] [[H4264|their army]] [[H2568|of about fifteen]] [[H505|thousand —]] ⟨men⟩ [[H3605|all]] [[H3498|that were left]] [[H3605|of]] [[H4264|the armies]] [[H1121|of the people]] [[H6924|of the East.]] [[H3967|A hundred]] [[H6242|and twenty]] [[H505|thousand]] [[H376|swordsmen]] [[H5307|had already fallen.]] ^0810

[[H1439|And Gideon]] [[H5927|went up]] [[H7931|by way of the caravan]] [[H1870|route]] [[H6924|east]] [[H5025|of Nobah]] [[H3011|and Jogbehah,]] [[H5221|and he attacked]] [[H4264|their army,]] ⟨taking them⟩ [[H4264|]] [[H983|by surprise.]] ^0811

[[H2078|When Zebah]] [[H6759|and Zalmunna]] [[H5127|fled,]] ⟨Gideon⟩ [[H7291|pursued]] [[H3920|and captured]] [[H8147|these two]] [[H4428|kings]] [[H4080|of Midian,]] [[H2729|routing]] [[H3605|their entire]] [[H4264|army.]] ^0812

[[H1439|After this, Gideon]] [[H1121|son]] [[H3101|of Joash]] [[H7725|returned]] [[H4480|from]] [[H4421|the battle]] [[H4608|along the Ascent of]] [[H2775|Heres.]] ^0813

[[H3920|There he captured]] [[H5288|a young man]] [[H5523|of Succoth]] [[H7592|and interrogated him.]] [[H3789|The young man wrote down]] [[H413|for him]] [[H7657|the names of the seventy-seven]] [[H8269|leaders]] [[H2205|and elders]] [[H5523|of Succoth.]] ^0814

[[H935|And went]] ⟨Gideon⟩ [[H413|to]] [[H376|the men]] [[H5523|of Succoth]] [[H559|and said,]] [[H2009|“Here]] [[H2078|are Zebah]] [[H6759|and Zalmunna,]] [[H834|about whom]] [[H2778|you taunted]] [[H853|me,]] [[H559|saying,]] [[H3709|‘ the hands]] ⟨Are⟩ [[H2078|of Zebah]] [[H6759|and Zalmunna]] [[H6258|already]] [[H3027|in your possession,]] [[H3588|that]] [[H5414|we should give]] [[H3899|bread]] [[H3286|to your weary]] [[H376|men?]] ^0815

[[H3947|Then he took]] [[H2205|the elders]] [[H5892|of the city,]] [[H853|and]] ⟨using⟩ [[H6975|the thorns]] [[H1303|and briers]] [[H4057|of the wilderness,]] [[H3045|he disciplined]] [[H376|the men]] [[H5523|of Succoth.]] ^0816

[[H5422|He also pulled down]] [[H4026|the tower]] [[H6439|of Penuel]] [[H2026|and killed]] [[H376|the men]] [[H5892|of the city.]] ^0817

[[H559|Next, asked]] ⟨Gideon⟩ [[H2078|Zebah]] [[H6759|and Zalmunna,]] [[H375|“What kind]] [[H376|of men]] [[H2026|did you kill]] [[H8396|at Tabor?”]] [[H3644|“Men like you,”]] [[H559|they answered,]] [[H259|“ one]] ⟨each⟩ [[H8389|resembling]] [[H1121|the son]] [[H4428|of a king.”]] ^0818

[[H1992|“They]] [[H251|were my brothers,”]] [[H559|Gideon replied,]] [[H1121|“the sons]] [[H517|of my mother!]] [[H3068|As surely as the LORD]] [[H2416|lives,]] [[H3863|if]] [[H2421|you had let them live,]] [[H3808|I would not]] [[H2026|kill]] [[H853|you.”]] ^0819

[[H559|So he said]] [[H3500|to Jether,]] [[H1060|his firstborn,]] [[H6965|“Get up]] [[H2026|and kill them.”]] [[H5288|But the young man]] [[H3808|did not]] [[H8025|draw]] [[H2719|his sword;]] [[H3372|he was fearful]] [[H3588|because]] [[H5750|he was still]] [[H5288|a youth.]] ^0820

[[H2078|Then Zebah]] [[H6759|and Zalmunna]] [[H559|said,]] [[H6965|“Get up]] [[H6293|and kill]] [[H859|us yourself,]] [[H3588|for]] [[H376|as the man is,]] [[H1369|so is his strength.”]] [[H1439|So Gideon]] [[H6965|arose]] [[H2026|and killed]] [[H2078|Zebah]] [[H6759|and Zalmunna,]] [[H3947|and he took]] [[H7720|the crescent ornaments]] [[H6677|from the necks]] [[H1581|of their camels.]] ^0821

[[H376|Then the Israelites]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H1439|Gideon,]] [[H4910|“Rule over us—]] [[H859|you,]] [[H1571|and]] [[H1121|your son]] [[H1571|and]] [[H1121|grandson—]] [[H3588|for]] [[H3467|you have delivered us]] [[H3027|from the hand]] [[H4080|of Midian.”]] ^0822

[[H1439|But Gideon]] [[H559|replied,]] [[H589|“I]] [[H3808|will not]] [[H4910|rule over you,]] [[H3808|nor]] [[H4910|will]] [[H1121|my son.]] [[H3068|The LORD]] [[H4910|shall rule]] ^0823

[[H1439|Then he]] [[H559|added,]] [[H7592|“Let me make a request]] [[H4480|of you,]] [[H376|that each of you]] [[H5414|give]] [[H5141|me an earring]] [[H7998|from his plunder.”]] [[H3588|(Now]] ⟨the enemy⟩ [[H2091|had gold]] [[H5141|earrings]] [[H3588|because]] [[H1992|they]] [[H3459|were Ishmaelites.)]] ^0824

[[H5414|“We will give]] ⟨them⟩ [[H5414|gladly,”]] [[H559|they replied.]] [[H6566|So they spread out]] [[H8071|a garment,]] [[H376|and each man]] [[H7993|threw]] [[H5141|an earring]] [[H7998|from his plunder]] [[H8033|onto it.]] ^0825

[[H4948|The weight]] [[H2091|of the gold]] [[H5141|earrings]] [[H7592|he had requested]] [[H1961|was]] [[H505|1,700]] ⟨shekels⟩ [[H2091|,]] [[H905|in addition to]] [[H7720|the crescent ornaments,]] [[H5188|the pendants,]] [[H713|the purple]] [[H899|garments]] [[H5921|of]] [[H4428|the kings]] [[H4080|of Midian,]] [[H6060|and the chains]] [[H6677|from the necks]] [[H1581|of their camels.]] ^0826

⟨From all this⟩ [[H1439|Gideon]] [[H6213|made]] [[H646|an ephod,]] [[H3322|which he placed]] [[H6084|in Ophrah,]] [[H5892|his hometown.]] [[H3605|But soon all]] [[H3478|Israel]] [[H2181|prostituted themselves]] [[H310|by worshiping it]] [[H8033|there,]] [[H1961|and it became]] [[H4170|a snare]] [[H1439|to Gideon]] [[H1004|and his household.]] ^0827

[[H4080|In this way Midian]] [[H3665|was subdued]] [[H6440|before]] [[H1121|the Israelites]] [[H3808|and did not]] [[H5375|raise]] [[H7218|its head]] [[H3254|again.]] [[H776|So the land]] [[H8252|had rest]] [[H705|for forty]] [[H8141|years]] [[H3117|in the days]] [[H1439|of Gideon,]] ^0828

[[H3378|and he—Jerubbaal]] [[H1121|son]] [[H3101|of Joash—]] [[H1980|returned]] [[H1004|home]] [[H3427|and settled down.]] ^0829

[[H1439|Gideon]] [[H1961|had]] [[H7657|seventy]] [[H1121|sons]] [[H3318|of his own,]] [[H3588|since]] [[H1961|he had]] [[H7227|many]] [[H802|wives.]] ^0830

[[H6370|His concubine,]] [[H834|who]] ⟨dwelt⟩ [[H7927|in Shechem,]] [[H1571|also]] [[H3205|bore]] [[H1121|him a son,]] [[H7760|and he named]] [[H40|him Abimelech.]] ^0831

[[H1439|Later, Gideon]] [[H1121|son]] [[H3101|of Joash]] [[H4191|died]] [[H2896|at a ripe]] [[H7872|old age]] [[H6912|and was buried]] [[H6913|in the tomb]] [[H1|of his father]] [[H3101|Joash]] [[H6084|in Ophrah]] [[H33|of the Abiezrites.]] ^0832

[[H1961|And]] [[H834|as soon as]] [[H1439|Gideon]] [[H4191|was dead,]] [[H1121|the Israelites]] [[H7725|turned]] [[H2181|and prostituted themselves]] [[H310|with]] [[H1168|the Baals,]] [[H7760|and they set up]] [[H1170|Baal-berith]] [[H430|as their god.]] ^0833

[[H1121|The Israelites]] [[H3808|failed]] [[H2142|to remember]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H430|their God]] [[H5337|who had delivered]] [[H853|them]] [[H3027|from the hands]] [[H3605|of all]] [[H341|their enemies]] [[H5439|on every side.]] ^0834

[[H3808|They did not]] [[H6213|show]] [[H2617|kindness]] [[H5973|to]] [[H1004|the house]] [[H3378|of Jerubbaal]] [[H1439|(that is, Gideon)]] [[H3605|for all]] [[H2896|the good things]] [[H6213|he had done]] [[H5973|for]] [[H3478|Israel.]] ^0835

[[H40|Now Abimelech]] [[H1121|son]] [[H3378|of Jerubbaal]] [[H1980|went]] [[H413|to]] [[H517|his mother’s]] [[H251|brothers]] [[H7927|at Shechem]] [[H1696|and said]] [[H413|to]] [[H413|them]] [[H3605|and all]] [[H4940|the clan]] [[H517|of his mother,]] ^0901

[[H4994|“Please]] [[H1696|ask]] [[H3605|all]] [[H1167|the leaders]] [[H7927|of Shechem,]] [[H2896|‘Is it better]] [[H7657|for you  that seventy]] [[H376|men,]] [[H3605|all]] [[H1121|the sons]] [[H3378|of Jerubbaal,]] [[H4910|rule]] [[H518|over you,  or]] [[H259|just one]] [[H376|man?’]] [[H2142|Remember]] [[H3588|that]] [[H589|I]] [[H1320|am your own flesh]] [[H6106|and blood.]] ^0902

[[H517|And when his mother’s]] [[H251|brothers]] [[H1696|spoke]] [[H3605|all]] [[H428|these]] [[H1697|words]] [[H5921|about]] [[H241|him in the presence]] [[H3605|of all]] [[H1167|the leaders]] [[H7927|of Shechem,]] [[H3820|their hearts]] [[H5186|were inclined]] [[H310|to follow]] [[H40|Abimelech,]] [[H3588|for]] [[H559|they said,]] [[H1931|“He]] [[H251|is our brother.”]] ^0903

[[H5414|So they gave]] [[H7657|him  seventy]] ⟨shekels⟩ [[H3701|of silver]] [[H1004|from the temple]] [[H1170|of  Baal-berith,]] [[H40|with which  Abimelech]] [[H7936|hired]] [[H7386|some worthless]] [[H6348|and reckless]] [[H582|men]] [[H1980|to follow]] [[H310|him.]] ^0904

[[H935|He went]] [[H1|to his father’s]] [[H1004|house]] [[H6084|in Ophrah,]] [[H5921|and on]] [[H259|one]] [[H68|stone]] [[H2026|murdered]] [[H7657|his seventy]] [[H251|brothers,]] [[H1121|the sons]] [[H3378|of Jerubbaal.]] [[H3147|But Jotham,]] [[H6996|the youngest]] [[H1121|son]] [[H3378|of Jerubbaal,]] [[H3498|survived,]] [[H3588|because]] [[H2244|he hid himself.]] ^0905

[[H3605|Then all]] [[H1167|the leaders]] [[H7927|of Shechem]] [[H3605|and]] [[H4407|Beth-millo]] [[H622|gathered]] [[H5973|beside]] [[H436|the oak]] [[H5324|at the pillar]] [[H7927|in Shechem]] [[H1980|and proceeded]] [[H4427|to make]] [[H40|Abimelech]] ⟨their⟩ [[H4428|king.]] ^0906

[[H5046|When this was reported]] [[H3147|to Jotham,]] [[H1980|he climbed]] [[H7218|to the top]] [[H2022|of Mount]] [[H1630|Gerizim,]] [[H5375|raised]] [[H6963|his voice,]] [[H7121|and cried out:]] [[H8085|“Listen]] [[H413|to me,]] [[H1167|O leaders]] [[H7927|of Shechem,]] [[H430|and may God]] [[H8085|listen]] [[H413|to you.]] ^0907

[[H6086|One day the trees]] [[H1980|set out]] [[H4886|to anoint]] [[H4428|a king]] [[H5921|for themselves.]] [[H559|They said]] [[H2132|to the olive tree,]] [[H4427|‘Reign]] [[H5921|over us.’]] ^0908

[[H2132|But the olive tree]] [[H559|replied,]] [[H2308|‘Should I stop giving]] [[H1880|my oil]] [[H834|that]] [[H3513|honors]] [[H430|both God]] [[H376|and man,]] [[H1980|to hold]] [[H5128|sway]] [[H5921|over]] [[H6086|the trees?’]] ^0909

[[H6086|Then the trees]] [[H559|said]] [[H8384|to the fig tree,]] [[H1980|‘Come]] [[H4427|and reign]] [[H5921|over us.’]] ^0910

[[H8384|But the fig tree]] [[H559|replied,]] [[H2308|‘Should I stop giving]] [[H4987|my sweetness]] [[H2896|and my good]] [[H8570|fruit,]] [[H1980|to hold]] [[H5128|sway]] [[H5921|over]] [[H6086|the trees?’]] ^0911

[[H6086|Then the trees]] [[H559|said]] [[H1612|to the grapevine,]] [[H1980|‘Come]] [[H4427|and reign]] [[H5921|over us.’]] ^0912

[[H1612|But the grapevine]] [[H559|replied,]] [[H2308|‘Should I stop giving]] [[H8492|my wine]] [[H8055|that cheers]] ⟨both⟩ [[H430|God]] [[H376|and man,]] [[H1980|to hold]] [[H5128|sway]] [[H5921|over]] [[H6086|the trees?’]] ^0913

[[H3605|Finally all]] [[H6086|the trees]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H329|the thornbush,]] [[H1980|‘Come]] [[H4427|and reign]] [[H5921|over us.’]] ^0914

[[H329|But the thornbush]] [[H559|replied,]] [[H518|‘If]] [[H859|you]] [[H571|really]] [[H4886|are anointing me]] [[H4428|as king]] [[H5921|over you,]] [[H935|come]] [[H2620|and find refuge]] [[H6738|in my shade.]] [[H518|But if]] [[H369|not,]] [[H784|may fire]] [[H3318|come out]] [[H4480|of]] [[H329|the thornbush]] [[H398|and consume]] [[H730|the cedars]] [[H3844|of Lebanon.”]] ^0915

[[H3147|Then Jotham]] [[H5127|ran away,]] [[H1272|escaping]] [[H876|to Beer,]] [[H3427|and he lived]] [[H8033|there]] [[H6440|for fear]] [[H251|of his brother]] [[H40|Abimelech.]] ^0921

[[H2083|When Zebul]] [[H8269|the governor]] [[H5892|of the city]] [[H8085|heard]] [[H1697|the words]] [[H1603|of Gaal]] [[H1121|son]] [[H5651|of Ebed,]] [[H2734|he burned]] [[H639|with anger.]] ^0930

[[H7971|So he covertly sent]] [[H4397|messengers]] [[H413|to]] [[H40|Abimelech]] [[H559|to say,]] [[H2009|“Look,]] [[H1603|Gaal]] [[H1121|son]] [[H5651|of Ebed]] [[H251|and his brothers]] [[H935|have come]] [[H7927|to Shechem]] [[H6696|and are stirring up]] [[H5892|the city]] [[H5921|against you.]] ^0931

[[H6258|Now then,]] [[H3915|tonight]] [[H859|you]] [[H5971|and the people]] [[H854|with you]] [[H6965|are to come]] [[H693|and lie in wait]] [[H7704|in the fields.]] ^0932

[[H1961|And]] [[H1242|in the morning]] [[H2224|at sunrise,]] [[H7925|get up]] [[H6584|and advance]] [[H5921|against]] [[H5892|the city.]] [[H1931|When]] ⟨Gaal⟩ [[H5971|and his men]] [[H3318|come out]] [[H413|against you,]] [[H6213|do]] [[H834|to them  whatever]] [[H4672|you are able.”]] ^0933

[[H40|So Abimelech]] [[H3605|and all]] [[H5971|his troops]] [[H6965|set out]] [[H3915|by night]] [[H693|and lay in wait]] [[H5921|against]] [[H7927|Shechem]] [[H702|in four]] [[H7218|companies.]] ^0934

[[H1603|Now Gaal]] [[H1121|son]] [[H5651|of Ebed]] [[H3318|went out]] [[H5975|and stood]] [[H6607|at the entrance]] [[H5892|of the city]] [[H8179|gate]] [[H40|just as Abimelech]] [[H5971|and his men]] [[H6965|came out]] [[H4480|from]] [[H3993|their hiding places.]] ^0935

[[H1603|When Gaal]] [[H7200|saw]] [[H5971|the people,]] [[H559|he said]] [[H413|to]] [[H2083|Zebul,]] [[H2009|“Look,]] [[H5971|people]] [[H3381|are coming down]] [[H7218|from the mountains!”]] [[H2083|But Zebul]] [[H559|replied,]] [[H6738|“The shadows]] [[H2022|of the mountains]] [[H7200|look]] [[H376|like men]] [[H859|to you.”]] ^0936

[[H1603|Then Gaal]] [[H1696|spoke up]] [[H3254|again,]] [[H2009|“Look,]] [[H5971|people]] [[H3381|are coming down]] [[H5973|from]] [[H2872|the center]] [[H776|of the land,]] [[H259|and one]] [[H7218|company]] [[H935|is coming]] [[H1870|by way of]] [[H6049|the Diviners’]] [[H436|Oak.”]] ^0937

[[H346|“Where]] [[H6310|is your gloating]] [[H645|now?”]] [[H2083|Zebul]] [[H559|replied.]] [[H559|“You said,]] [[H4310|‘Who]] [[H40|is Abimelech]] [[H3588|that]] [[H5647|we should serve him?’]] [[H3808|Are these not]] [[H5971|the people]] [[H3988|you ridiculed?]] [[H3318|Go out]] [[H6258|now]] [[H3898|and fight them!”]] ^0938

[[H1603|So Gaal]] [[H3318|went out]] [[H6440|before]] [[H1167|the leaders]] [[H7927|of Shechem]] [[H3898|and fought]] [[H40|against Abimelech,]] ^0939

[[H40|but Abimelech]] [[H7291|pursued him,]] [[H5127|and Gaal fled]] [[H6440|before him.]] [[H7227|And many]] ⟨Shechemites⟩ [[H5307|fell]] [[H2491|wounded]] [[H5704|all the way]] [[H6607|to the entrance]] [[H8179|of the gate.]] ^0940

[[H40|Abimelech]] [[H3427|stayed]] [[H725|in Arumah,]] [[H2083|and Zebul]] [[H1644|drove]] [[H1603|Gaal]] [[H251|and his brothers]] [[H3427|out of]] [[H7927|Shechem.]] ^0941

[[H4283|The next day]] [[H5971|the people]] ⟨of Shechem⟩ [[H3318|went out]] [[H7704|into the fields,]] [[H5046|and this was reported]] [[H40|to Abimelech.]] ^0942

[[H3947|So he took]] [[H5971|his men,]] [[H2673|divided]] [[H7969|them into three]] [[H7218|companies,]] [[H693|and waited in ambush]] [[H7704|in the fields.]] [[H7200|When he saw]] [[H5971|the people]] [[H3318|coming out]] [[H4480|of]] [[H5892|the city,]] [[H6965|he rose up]] [[H5921|against them]] [[H5221|and attacked them.]] ^0943

[[H40|Then Abimelech]] [[H7218|and the companies]] [[H5973|with him]] [[H6584|rushed forward]] [[H5975|and took their stand]] [[H6607|at the entrance]] [[H5892|of the city]] [[H8179|gate.]] [[H8147|The other two]] [[H7218|companies]] [[H6584|rushed]] [[H5921|against]] [[H3605|all]] [[H834|who]] ⟨were⟩ [[H7704|in the fields]] [[H5221|and struck them down.]] ^0944

[[H3605|And all]] [[H1931|that]] [[H3117|day]] [[H40|Abimelech]] [[H3898|fought]] [[H5892|against the city]] [[H3920|until he had captured it]] [[H2026|and killed]] [[H5971|its people.]] [[H5422|Then he demolished]] [[H5892|the city]] [[H2232|and sowed]] [[H4417|it with salt.]] ^0945

[[H8085|On hearing of this,]] [[H3605|all]] [[H1167|the leaders]] [[H4026|in the tower]] [[H7927|of Shechem]] [[H935|entered]] [[H6877|the inner chamber]] [[H1004|of the temple]] [[H1286|of El-berith.]] ^0946

[[H5046|And when it was reported]] [[H40|to Abimelech]] [[H3588|that]] [[H3605|all]] [[H1167|the leaders]] [[H4026|in the tower]] [[H7927|of Shechem]] [[H6908|were gathered there,]] ^0947

[[H40|he]] [[H3605|and all]] [[H5971|his men]] [[H5927|went up]] [[H2022|to Mount]] [[H6756|Zalmon.]] [[H40|Abimelech]] [[H3947|took]] [[H7134|his ax]] [[H3027|in his hand]] [[H3772|and cut]] [[H7754|a branch]] [[H6086|from the trees,]] [[H5375|which he lifted]] [[H5921|to]] [[H7926|his shoulder,]] [[H559|saying]] [[H413|to]] [[H5971|his men,]] [[H4116|Hurry]] [[H6213|and do]] [[H4100|what]] [[H7200|you have seen]] [[H6213|me do.]] ^0948

[[H3605|So each]] [[H376|man]] [[H1571|also]] [[H3772|cut]] [[H7754|his own branch]] [[H1980|and followed]] [[H40|Abimelech.]] [[H7760|Then they piled]] ⟨the branches⟩ [[H5921|against]] [[H6877|the inner chamber]] [[H3341|and set it]] [[H784|on fire]] [[H5921|above them,]] [[H4191|killing]] [[H3605|everyone]] [[H4026|in the tower]] [[H7927|of Shechem,]] [[H505|about a thousand]] [[H376|men]] [[H802|and women.]] ^0949

[[H40|Then Abimelech]] [[H1980|went]] [[H413|to]] [[H8405|Thebez,]] [[H2583|encamped]] [[H8405|against it,]] [[H3920|and captured it.]] ^0950

[[H1961|But there was]] [[H5797|a strong]] [[H4026|tower]] [[H8432|inside]] [[H5892|the city,]] [[H3605|and all]] [[H582|the men,]] [[H802|women,]] [[H1167|and leaders]] [[H5892|of the city]] [[H5127|fled]] [[H8033|there.]] [[H5462|They locked themselves in]] [[H5927|and went up]] [[H5921|to]] [[H1406|the roof]] [[H4026|of the tower.]] ^0951

[[H40|When Abimelech]] [[H935|came]] [[H5704|to]] [[H3898|attack]] [[H4026|the tower,]] [[H5066|he approached]] [[H4026|its]] [[H6607|entrance]] [[H8313|to set it on fire.]] ^0952

[[H259|But a]] [[H802|woman]] [[H7993|dropped]] [[H6400|an upper]] [[H7393|millstone]] [[H5921|on]] [[H40|Abimelech’s]] [[H7218|head,]] [[H7533|crushing]] [[H1538|his skull.]] ^0953

[[H4120|He quickly]] [[H7121|called]] [[H5375|his armor-bearer,]] [[H559|saying,]] [[H8025|“Draw]] [[H2719|your sword]] [[H4191|and kill me,]] [[H6435|lest]] [[H559|they say]] [[H802|of me,  ‘A woman]] [[H2026|killed him.’”]] [[H1856|So Abimelech’s armor-bearer ran through him,]] ⟨his sword⟩ [[H4191|and he died.]] ^0954

[[H376|And when the Israelites]] [[H7200|saw]] [[H3588|that]] [[H40|Abimelech]] [[H4191|was dead,]] [[H376|they all]] [[H1980|went]] [[H4725|home.]] ^0955

[[H430|In this way God]] [[H7725|repaid]] [[H7451|the wickedness]] [[H834|that]] [[H40|Abimelech]] [[H6213|had done]] [[H1|to his father]] [[H2026|by murdering]] [[H7657|his seventy]] [[H251|brothers.]] ^0956

[[H430|And God]] [[H7725|also brought back]] [[H7218|upon their own heads]] [[H3605|all]] [[H7451|the evil]] [[H376|of the men]] [[H7927|of Shechem.]] [[H7045|So the curse]] [[H3147|of Jotham]] [[H1121|son]] [[H3378|of Jerubbaal]] [[H935|came]] [[H413|upon them.]] ^0957

[[H310|After the time]] [[H40|of Abimelech,]] [[H376|a man]] [[H3485|of Issachar,]] [[H8439|Tola]] [[H1121|son]] [[H6312|of Puah,]] [[H1121|the son]] [[H1734|of Dodo,]] [[H6965|rose]] [[H3467|to deliver]] [[H3478|Israel.]] [[H3427|He lived]] [[H8069|in Shamir,]] [[H2022|in the hill country]] [[H669|of Ephraim.]] ^1001

[[H8199|Tola judged]] [[H3478|Israel]] [[H6242|twenty-three]] [[H8141|years,]] [[H4191|and when he died,]] [[H6912|he was buried]] [[H8069|in Shamir.]] ^1002

[[H310|After]] ⟨Tola⟩ [[H6965|arose]] [[H2971|Jair]] [[H1569|the Gileadite,]] [[H8199|who judged]] [[H3478|Israel]] [[H6242|twenty-two]] [[H8141|years.]] ^1003

[[H1961|He had]] [[H7970|thirty]] [[H1121|sons]] [[H7392|who rode]] [[H5921|on]] [[H7970|thirty]] [[H5895|donkeys.]] [[H1992|And they had]] [[H7970|thirty]] [[H5895|towns]] [[H776|in the land]] [[H1568|of Gilead,]] [[H5704|which to]] [[H2088|this]] [[H3117|day]] [[H7121|are called]] [[H2334|Havvoth-jair.]] ^1004

[[H2971|When Jair]] [[H4191|died,]] [[H6912|he was buried]] [[H7056|in Kamon.]] ^1005

[[H3254|And again]] [[H1121|the Israelites]] [[H6213|did]] [[H7451|evil]] [[H5869|in the sight]] [[H3068|of the LORD.]] [[H5647|They served]] [[H1168|the Baals,]] [[H6252|the Ashtoreths,]] [[H430|the gods]] [[H758|of Aram,]] [[H6721|Sidon,]] [[H853|and]] [[H4124|Moab,]] [[H853|and]] [[H430|the gods]] [[H1121|of the Ammonites]] [[H6430|and Philistines.]] [[H5800|Thus they forsook]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H3808|and did not]] [[H5647|serve Him.]] ^1006

[[H639|So the anger]] [[H3068|of the LORD]] [[H2734|burned]] [[H3478|against Israel,]] [[H4376|and He sold them]] [[H3027|into the hands]] [[H6430|of the Philistines]] [[H1121|and Ammonites,]] ^1007

[[H1931|who that very]] [[H8141|year]] [[H7492|harassed]] [[H7533|and oppressed]] [[H1121|the Israelites,]] [[H8083|and did so for eighteen]] [[H8141|years]] [[H3605|to all]] [[H1121|the Israelites]] [[H5676|on the other side]] [[H3383|of the Jordan]] [[H1568|in Gilead,]] [[H776|the land]] [[H567|of the Amorites.]] ^1008

[[H1121|The Ammonites]] [[H1571|also]] [[H5674|crossed]] [[H3383|the Jordan]] [[H3898|to fight]] [[H3063|against Judah,]] [[H1144|Benjamin,]] [[H1004|and the house]] [[H669|of Ephraim,]] [[H3478|and Israel]] [[H3966|was in severe]] [[H3334|distress.]] ^1009

[[H1121|Then the Israelites]] [[H2199|cried out]] [[H413|to]] [[H3068|the LORD,]] [[H559|saying,]] [[H2398|“We have sinned]] [[H3588|against You,  for we have indeed]] [[H5800|forsaken]] [[H430|our God]] [[H5647|and served]] [[H1168|the Baals.”]] ^1010

[[H3068|The LORD]] [[H559|replied,]] [[H4714|“When the Egyptians,]] [[H567|Amorites,]] [[H1121|Ammonites,]] [[H6430|Philistines,]] ^1011

[[H6722|Sidonians,]] [[H6002|Amalekites,]] [[H4584|and Maonites]] [[H3905|oppressed you]] [[H6817|and you cried out]] [[H413|to Me,]] [[H3467|did I not deliver]] [[H853|you]] [[H3027|from their hands?]] ^1012

[[H859|But you]] [[H5800|have forsaken]] [[H853|Me]] [[H5647|and served]] [[H312|other]] [[H430|gods,]] [[H3651|so]] [[H3808|I will no]] [[H3254|longer]] [[H3467|deliver]] [[H853|you.]] ^1013

[[H1980|Go]] [[H2199|and cry out]] [[H413|to]] [[H430|the gods]] [[H977|you have chosen.]] [[H1992|Let them]] [[H3467|deliver]] [[H6256|you  in your time]] [[H6869|of distress.”]] ^1014

[[H2398|“We have sinned,”]] [[H1121|the Israelites]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H3068|the LORD.]] [[H6213|“Deal]] [[H5869|with us  as You see]] [[H2896|fit;]] [[H389|but]] [[H4994|please]] [[H5337|deliver us today!”]] ^1015

[[H5493|So they put away]] [[H5236|the foreign]] [[H430|gods]] [[H7130|from among them]] [[H5647|and served]] [[H3068|the LORD,]] [[H5315|and He]] [[H7114|could no longer bear]] [[H5999|the misery]] [[H3478|of Israel.]] ^1016

[[H1121|Then the Ammonites]] [[H6817|were called to arms]] [[H2583|and camped]] [[H1568|in Gilead,]] [[H1121|and the Israelites]] [[H622|assembled]] [[H2583|and camped]] [[H4709|at Mizpah.]] ^1017

[[H8269|The rulers]] [[H1568|of Gilead]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H376|one]] [[H7453|another,]] [[H4310|“Whoever]] [[H2490|will launch]] [[H3898|the attack]] [[H1121|against the Ammonites]] [[H1961|will be]] [[H7218|the head]] [[H3605|of all]] [[H3427|who live]] [[H1568|in Gilead.”]] ^1018

[[H3316|Now Jephthah]] [[H1569|the Gileadite]] [[H1961|was]] [[H2428|a mighty]] [[H1368|warrior;]] [[H1931|he]] [[H1121|was the son]] [[H2181|of a prostitute,]] [[H1568|and Gilead]] [[H3316|was his]] [[H3205|father.]] ^1101

[[H1568|And Gilead’s]] [[H802|wife]] [[H3205|bore]] [[H1121|him sons,]] [[H1121|who]] [[H1431|grew up,]] [[H3316|drove Jephthah]] [[H1644|out,]] [[H559|and said]] [[H3808|to him,  “You shall have no]] [[H5157|inheritance]] [[H1|in our father’s]] [[H1004|house,]] [[H3588|because]] [[H859|you]] [[H1121|are the son]] [[H312|of another]] [[H802|woman.”]] ^1102

[[H3316|So Jephthah]] [[H1272|fled]] [[H6440|from]] [[H251|his brothers]] [[H3427|and settled]] [[H776|in the land]] [[H2897|of Tob,]] [[H7386|where a group of rebels]] [[H3950|joined]] [[H3316|him]] [[H3318|and traveled]] [[H5973|with him.]] ^1103

[[H1961|Some time later,]] [[H1121|when the Ammonites]] [[H3898|fought]] [[H5973|against]] [[H3478|Israel]] ^1104

[[H1961|and]] [[H3898|made war]] [[H5973|with]] ⟨them⟩ [[H3478|,]] [[H2205|the elders]] [[H1568|of Gilead]] [[H1980|went]] [[H3947|to get]] [[H3316|Jephthah]] [[H776|from the land]] [[H2897|of Tob.]] ^1105

[[H1980|“Come,”]] [[H559|they said,]] [[H1961|“be]] [[H7101|our commander,]] [[H3898|so that we can fight]] [[H1121|against the Ammonites.”]] ^1106

[[H3316|Jephthah]] [[H559|replied]] [[H2205|to the elders]] [[H1568|of Gilead,]] [[H859|“Did you]] [[H3808|not]] [[H8130|hate]] [[H853|me]] [[H1644|and expel me]] [[H1|from my father’s]] [[H1004|house?]] [[H4069|So why]] [[H935|then have you come]] [[H413|to me]] [[H6258|now]] [[H834|when]] [[H6862|you are in distress?”]] ^1107

[[H2205|They]] [[H559|answered]] [[H3316|Jephthah,]] [[H3651|“This is why]] [[H6258|we now]] [[H7725|turn]] [[H413|to you,]] [[H1980|that you may go]] [[H5973|with us,]] [[H3898|fight]] [[H1121|the Ammonites,]] [[H1961|and become]] [[H7218|leader]] [[H3605|over all]] [[H3427|of us  who live]] [[H1568|in Gilead.”]] ^1108

[[H3316|But Jephthah]] [[H559|answered,]] [[H518|“If]] [[H859|you]] [[H7725|take me back]] [[H3898|to fight]] [[H1121|the Ammonites]] [[H3068|and the LORD]] [[H5414|gives]] [[H6440|them to me,]] [[H595|will I]] [[H1961|really be]] [[H7218|your leader?”]] ^1109

[[H3316|So Jephthah]] [[H1980|went]] [[H5973|with]] [[H2205|the elders]] [[H1568|of Gilead,]] [[H5971|and the people]] [[H7760|put]] [[H5921|him over themselves]] [[H7218|as leader]] [[H7101|and commander.]] [[H3316|And Jephthah]] [[H1696|repeated]] [[H3605|all]] [[H1697|his terms]] [[H6440|in the presence]] [[H3068|of the LORD]] [[H4709|at Mizpah.]] ^1111

[[H3316|Then Jephthah]] [[H7971|sent]] [[H4397|messengers]] [[H413|to]] [[H4428|the king]] [[H1121|of the Ammonites,]] [[H559|saying,]] [[H4100|“What]] [[H3588|do you have against me  that]] [[H935|you have come]] [[H3898|to fight]] [[H413|against]] [[H776|my land?”]] ^1112

[[H7307|Then the Spirit]] [[H3068|of the LORD]] [[H1961|came]] [[H5921|upon]] [[H3316|Jephthah,]] [[H5674|and he passed through]] [[H1568|Gilead]] [[H853|and]] [[H4519|Manasseh,]] [[H5674|then through]] [[H4708|Mizpah]] [[H1568|of Gilead.]] [[H4708|And from]] ⟨there⟩ [[H5674|he advanced]] [[H1121|against the Ammonites.]] ^1129

[[H3316|So Jephthah]] [[H5674|crossed over]] [[H413|to]] [[H1121|the Ammonites]] [[H3898|to fight against them,]] [[H3068|and the LORD]] [[H5414|delivered them]] [[H3027|into his hands.]] ^1132

[[H3316|And when Jephthah]] [[H935|returned]] [[H1004|home]] [[H4709|to Mizpah,]] [[H2009|there]] [[H1323|was his daughter]] [[H3318|coming out]] [[H7125|to meet him]] [[H8596|with tambourines]] [[H4246|and dancing!]] [[H1931|She]] [[H3173|was his only child;]] [[H369|he had  no]] [[H1121|son]] [[H176|or]] [[H1323|daughter]] [[H4480|besides her.]] ^1134

[[H1961|As soon as]] ⟨Jephthah⟩ [[H7200|saw]] [[H853|her,]] [[H7167|he tore]] [[H899|his clothes]] [[H559|and said,]] [[H162|“No!]] [[H1323|Not my daughter!]] [[H3766|You have brought me to my knees!]] [[H859|You]] [[H5916|have brought great misery upon me,]] [[H595|for I]] [[H6475|have given my word]] [[H413|to]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H3808|and cannot]] [[H7725|take it back.”]] ^1135

[[H1|“My father,”]] [[H559|she replied,]] [[H6475|“you have given your word]] [[H413|to]] [[H3068|the LORD.]] [[H6213|Do]] [[H834|to me as]] [[H3318|you have said,]] [[H310|for]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H6213|has]] [[H5360|avenged]] [[H341|you  of your enemies,]] [[H1121|the Ammonites.”]] ^1136

[[H1980|“Go,”]] [[H559|he said.]] [[H7971|And he sent her away]] [[H8147|for two]] [[H2320|months.]] [[H1931|So she]] [[H1980|left]] [[H7464|with her friends]] [[H1058|and mourned]] [[H1331|her virginity]] [[H5921|upon]] [[H2022|the mountains.]] ^1138

[[H7093|After]] [[H8147|two]] [[H2320|months,]] [[H7725|she returned]] [[H413|to]] [[H1|her father,]] [[H6213|and he did]] [[H5087|to her  as he had vowed.]] [[H1931|And she]] [[H3808|had never]] [[H3045|had relations]] [[H376|with a man.]] [[H1961|So it has become]] [[H2706|a custom]] [[H3478|in Israel]] ^1139

[[H376|Then the men]] [[H669|of Ephraim]] [[H6817|assembled]] [[H5674|and crossed]] ⟨the Jordan⟩ [[H6828|to Zaphon.]] [[H559|They said]] [[H3316|to Jephthah,]] [[H4069|“Why]] [[H5674|have you crossed over]] [[H3898|to fight]] [[H1121|the Ammonites]] [[H3808|without]] [[H7121|calling]] [[H1980|us to go]] [[H5973|with you?]] [[H1004|We will burn your house]] [[H8313|down]] [[H784|with you inside!”]] ^1201

[[H4495|So Manoah]] [[H6965|got up]] [[H1980|and followed]] [[H802|his wife.]] [[H935|When he came]] [[H413|to]] [[H376|the Man,]] [[H559|he asked,]] [[H859|“Are You]] [[H376|the Man]] [[H834|who]] [[H1696|spoke]] [[H413|to]] [[H802|my wife?”]] [[H589|“I]] [[H559|am,” He said.]] ^1311

[[H4495|Then Manoah]] [[H559|asked,]] [[H6258|“When]] [[H1697|Your words]] [[H935|come to pass,]] [[H4100|what]] [[H1961|will be]] [[H5288|the boy’s]] [[H4941|rule of life]] [[H4639|and mission?”]] ^1312

[[H4397|So the Angel]] [[H3069|of the LORD]] [[H559|answered]] [[H4495|Manoah,]] [[H802|“Your wife]] [[H8104|needs to do]] [[H3605|everything]] [[H559|I told her.]] ^1313

[[H3808|She is not]] [[H398|to eat]] [[H3605|anything]] [[H834|that]] [[H3318|comes]] [[H1612|from the vine]] [[H8354|or drink]] [[H3196|wine]] [[H7941|or strong drink.]] [[H408|And she must not]] [[H398|eat]] [[H3605|anything]] [[H2932|unclean.]] [[H8104|Your wife must do]] [[H3605|everything]] [[H6680|I have commanded her.”]] ^1314

[[H4994|“Please]] [[H6113|stay here,”]] [[H4495|Manoah]] [[H559|said]] [[H4397|to the Angel]] [[H3068|of the LORD,]] [[H6213|“and we will prepare]] [[H1423|a young goat]] [[H6440|for You.”]] ^1315

[[H4397|And the Angel]] [[H3068|of the LORD]] [[H559|replied,]] [[H518|“Even if]] [[H6113|I stay,]] [[H3808|I will not]] [[H398|eat]] [[H3899|your food.]] [[H518|But if]] [[H6213|you prepare]] [[H5930|a burnt offering,]] [[H5927|offer]] [[H3068|it to the LORD.”]] [[H3588|For]] [[H4495|Manoah]] [[H3808|did not]] [[H3045|know]] [[H1931|He]] [[H4397|was the Angel]] [[H3068|of the LORD.]] ^1316

[[H4495|Then Manoah]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H4397|Him,]] [[H4310|“What]] [[H8034|is Your name,]] [[H3513|so that we may honor]] [[H3588|You when]] [[H1697|Your word]] [[H935|comes to pass?”]] ^1317

[[H4100|“Why]] [[H7592|do you ask]] [[H8034|My name,”]] [[H559|said]] [[H4397|the Angel]] [[H3068|of the LORD,]] [[H1931|“since it]] [[H6383|is beyond comprehension?”]] ^1318

[[H4495|Then Manoah]] [[H3947|took]] [[H1423|a young goat]] [[H4503|and a grain offering]] [[H5927|and offered them]] [[H5921|on]] [[H6697|a rock]] [[H3068|to the LORD,]] [[H4495|and as Manoah]] [[H802|and his wife]] [[H7200|looked on,]] [[H6213|the LORD did]] [[H6381|a marvelous thing.]] ^1319

[[H3851|When the flame]] [[H5927|went up]] [[H5921|from]] [[H4196|the altar]] [[H8064|to the sky,]] [[H4397|the Angel]] [[H3068|of the LORD]] [[H5927|ascended]] [[H4196|in the]] [[H3851|flame.]] [[H4495|When Manoah]] [[H802|and his wife]] [[H7200|saw]] ⟨this⟩, [[H5307|they fell]] [[H5921|facedown]] [[H776|to the ground.]] ^1320

[[H4397|And when the Angel]] [[H3068|of the LORD]] [[H3808|did not]] [[H7200|appear]] [[H3254|again]] [[H413|to]] [[H4495|Manoah]] [[H413|and]] [[H802|his wife,]] [[H4495|Manoah]] [[H3045|realized]] [[H3588|that]] [[H1931|it]] [[H4397|was the Angel]] [[H3068|of the LORD.]] ^1321

[[H4191|“We are going to die,”]] [[H4495|he]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H802|his wife,]] [[H3588|“for]] [[H7200|we have seen]] [[H430|God!”]] ^1322

[[H802|But his wife]] [[H559|replied,]] [[H3863|“If]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H2654|had intended]] [[H4191|to kill us,]] [[H3808|He would not]] [[H3947|have accepted]] [[H5930|the burnt offering]] [[H4503|and the grain offering]] [[H3027|from our hands,]] [[H3808|nor would He]] [[H7200|have shown]] [[H3605|us all]] [[H428|these things]] [[H8085|or spoken]] [[H6256|to us]] [[H2063|this way.”]] ^1323

[[H802|So the woman]] [[H3205|gave birth to]] [[H1121|a son]] [[H7121|and named]] [[H8034|him]] [[H8123|Samson.]] [[H5288|The boy]] [[H1431|grew,]] [[H3068|and the LORD]] [[H1288|blessed him.]] ^1324

[[H7307|And the Spirit]] [[H3068|of the LORD]] [[H2490|began]] [[H6470|to stir him]] [[H4264|at Mahaneh]] [[H1835|Dan,]] [[H996|between]] [[H6881|Zorah]] [[H847|and Eshtaol.]] ^1325

[[H8123|One day Samson]] [[H3381|went down]] [[H8553|to Timnah,]] [[H7200|where he saw]] [[H6430|a young Philistine]] [[H1323|woman.]] ^1401

[[H5927|So he returned]] [[H5046|and told]] [[H1|his father]] [[H517|and his mother,]] [[H7200|“I have seen]] [[H1323|a daughter]] [[H6430|of the Philistines]] [[H8553|in Timnah.]] [[H6258|Now]] [[H3947|get]] [[H853|her]] [[H802|for me  as a wife.”]] ^1402

[[H1|But his father]] [[H517|and mother]] [[H559|replied,]] [[H369|“Can you not]] [[H1323|find a young woman]] [[H251|among your relatives]] [[H3605|or any]] [[H5971|of our people?]] [[H859|Must you]] [[H1980|go]] [[H6189|to the uncircumcised]] [[H6430|Philistines]] [[H3947|to get]] [[H802|a wife?”]] [[H8123|But Samson]] [[H559|told]] [[H1|his father,]] [[H3947|“Get]] [[H853|her]] [[H3588|for me,  for]] [[H1931|she]] [[H3474|is pleasing]] [[H5869|to my eyes.”]] ^1403

[[H1|(Now his father]] [[H517|and mother]] [[H3808|did not]] [[H3045|know]] [[H1931|this]] [[H3588|was from]] [[H3068|the LORD,]] [[H1931|who]] [[H1245|was seeking]] [[H8385|an occasion to move]] [[H6430|against the Philistines;]] [[H1931|for at that]] [[H6256|time]] [[H6430|the Philistines]] [[H4910|were ruling]] [[H3478|over Israel.)]] ^1404

[[H8123|Then Samson]] [[H3381|went down]] [[H8553|to Timnah]] [[H1|with his father]] [[H517|and mother]] [[H935|and came]] [[H5704|to]] [[H3754|the vineyards]] [[H8553|of Timnah.]] [[H2009|Suddenly]] [[H3715|a young lion]] [[H7580|came roaring]] [[H7125|at him,]] ^1405

[[H7307|and the Spirit]] [[H3068|of the LORD]] [[H6743|took control]] [[H5921|of him,]] [[H8156|and he tore the lion apart]] [[H3972|with his bare]] [[H3027|hands]] [[H8156|as one would tear]] [[H1423|a young goat.]] [[H3808|But he did not]] [[H5046|tell]] [[H1|his father]] [[H517|or mother]] [[H834|what]] [[H6213|he had done.]] ^1406

[[H3381|Then continued on his way down]] ⟨Samson⟩ [[H1696|and spoke]] [[H802|to the woman,]] [[H8123|because]] ⟨he⟩ [[H3474|wanted]] [[H5869|her.]] ^1407

[[H7725|When returned]] ⟨Samson⟩ [[H3117|later]] [[H3947|to take her,]] [[H5493|he left]] [[H7200|the road to see]] [[H738|the lion’s]] [[H4658|carcass,]] [[H1472|and in]] ⟨it⟩ [[H2009|was]] [[H5712|a swarm]] [[H1682|of bees,]] [[H1706|along with their honey.]] ^1408

[[H7287|So he scooped]] [[H413|some honey into]] [[H3709|his hands]] [[H398|and ate it]] [[H1980|as he went along.]] [[H1980|When he returned]] [[H413|to]] [[H1|his father]] [[H517|and mother,]] [[H5414|he gave]] [[H398|some to them  and they ate it.]] [[H3808|But he did not]] [[H5046|tell]] [[H3588|them  that]] [[H7287|he had taken]] [[H1706|the honey]] [[H738|from the lion’s]] [[H1472|carcass.]] ^1409

[[H1|Then his father]] [[H3381|went]] [[H413|to]] [[H802|visit the woman,]] [[H8123|and Samson]] [[H6213|prepared]] [[H4960|a feast]] [[H8033|there,]] [[H3588|as]] [[H6213|was customary]] [[H970|for the bridegroom.]] ^1410

[[H1961|And when]] ⟨the Philistines⟩ [[H7200|saw him,]] [[H3947|they selected]] [[H7970|thirty]] [[H4828|men to accompany him.]] ^1411

[[H2330|“Let me tell]] [[H2420|you a riddle,”]] [[H8123|Samson]] [[H559|said to them.]] [[H518|“If]] [[H5046|you can solve]] [[H853|it]] [[H7651|for me seven]] ⟨within the⟩ [[H3117|days]] [[H4960|of the feast,]] [[H5414|I will give]] [[H7970|you  thirty]] [[H5466|linen garments]] [[H7970|and thirty]] [[H2487|sets]] [[H899|of clothes.]] ^1412

[[H518|But if]] [[H3808|you cannot]] [[H5046|solve it,]] [[H859|you]] [[H5414|must give]] [[H7970|me  thirty]] [[H5466|linen garments]] [[H7970|and thirty]] [[H2487|sets]] [[H899|of clothes.”]] [[H2330|“Tell]] [[H2420|us your riddle,”]] [[H559|they replied.]] [[H8085|“Let us hear it.”]] ^1413

[[H559|So he said to them:]] [[H398|“Out of the eater]] [[H3318|came]] [[H3978|something to eat,]] [[H5794|and out of the strong]] [[H3318|came]] [[H4966|something sweet.”]] [[H7969|For three]] [[H3117|days]] [[H3808|they were unable]] [[H5046|to explain]] [[H2420|the riddle.]] ^1414

[[H1961|So]] [[H7637|on the fourth]] [[H3117|day]] [[H559|they said]] [[H8123|to Samson’s]] [[H802|wife,]] [[H6601|“Entice]] [[H376|your husband]] [[H5046|to explain]] [[H2420|the riddle to us,]] [[H6435|or]] [[H8313|we will burn]] [[H853|you]] [[H1|and your father’s]] [[H1004|household]] [[H784|to death.]] [[H7121|Did you invite]] [[H3423|us here  to rob us?”]] ^1415

[[H8123|Then Samson’s]] [[H802|wife]] [[H5921|came to him,]] [[H1058|weeping,]] [[H559|and said,]] [[H8130|“You hate me!]] [[H3808|You do not really]] [[H157|love me!]] [[H2330|You have posed]] [[H1121|to my people]] [[H2420|a riddle,]] [[H3808|but have not]] [[H5046|explained it to me.”]] [[H2009|“Look,”]] [[H559|he said,]] [[H3808|“I have not]] [[H5046|even explained]] [[H1|it to my father]] [[H517|or mother,]] [[H5046|so why should I explain it]] ^1416

[[H1058|She wept]] [[H7651|the whole seven]] [[H3117|days]] [[H4960|of the feast,]] [[H1961|and finally]] [[H7637|on the seventh]] [[H3117|day,]] [[H3588|because]] [[H6693|she had pressed him so much,]] [[H5046|he told]] [[H5046|her.  And in turn she explained]] ⟨the answer⟩ [[H2420|the riddle]] [[H1121|to her people.]] ^1417

[[H2962|Before]] [[H935|sunset]] [[H7637|on the seventh]] [[H3117|day,]] [[H376|the men]] [[H5892|of the city]] [[H559|said]] [[H4100|to:  “What]] ⟨Samson⟩ [[H4966|is sweeter]] [[H1706|than honey?]] [[H4100|And what]] ⟨is⟩ [[H5794|stronger]] [[H738|than a lion?”]] [[H559|So he said to them:]] [[H3884|“If you had not]] [[H2790|plowed]] [[H5697|with my heifer,]] [[H3808|you would not]] [[H4672|have solved]] [[H2420|my riddle!”]] ^1418

[[H7307|Then the Spirit]] [[H3068|of the LORD]] [[H6743|came mightily]] [[H5921|upon him,]] [[H3381|and he went down]] [[H831|to Ashkelon,]] [[H5221|killed]] [[H7970|thirty]] [[H376|of their men,]] [[H3947|took]] [[H2488|their apparel,]] [[H5414|and gave]] [[H2487|their clothes]] [[H5046|to those who had solved]] [[H2420|the riddle.]] [[H2734|And burning]] [[H639|with anger,]] [[H5927|Samson returned]] [[H1|to his fathers]] [[H1004|house,]] ^1419

[[H8123|and his]] [[H802|wife]] [[H1961|was given]] [[H834|to one of the men who]] [[H7462|had accompanied]] ^1420

[[H1961|Later on,]] [[H3117|at the time]] [[H2406|of the wheat]] [[H7105|harvest,]] [[H8123|Samson]] [[H1423|took]] [[H5795|a young goat]] [[H6485|and went to visit]] [[H802|his wife.]] [[H935|“I want to go]] [[H413|to]] [[H802|my wife]] [[H2315|in her room,”]] [[H559|he said.]] [[H1|But her father]] [[H3808|would not]] [[H5414|let]] [[H935|him enter.]] ^1501

[[H559|“I was sure]] [[H8130|you thoroughly hated her,”]] [[H559|said]] [[H1|her father,]] [[H5414|“so I gave]] [[H4828|her to one of the men who accompanied you.]] [[H3808|Is not]] [[H6996|her younger]] [[H269|sister]] [[H2896|more beautiful]] [[H4480|than she?]] [[H4994|Please]] [[H1961|take]] [[H8478|her instead.”]] ^1502

[[H8123|Samson]] [[H559|said]] [[H6471|to them,  “This time]] [[H5352|I will be blameless]] [[H6213|in doing]] [[H7451|harm]] [[H6430|to the Philistines.”]] ^1503

[[H8123|Then Samson]] [[H1980|went out]] [[H3920|and caught]] [[H7969|three]] [[H3967|hundred]] [[H7776|foxes.]] [[H3947|And he took]] [[H3940|torches,]] [[H6437|turned]] [[H2180|the foxes tail-to-tail,]] [[H7760|and fastened]] [[H259|a]] [[H3940|torch]] [[H996|between]] [[H8147|each pair]] [[H2180|of tails.]] ^1504

[[H1197|Then he lit]] [[H3940|the torches]] [[H7971|and released]] ⟨the foxes⟩ [[H7054|into the standing grain]] [[H6430|of the Philistines,]] [[H1197|burning up]] [[H1430|the piles of grain]] [[H7054|and the standing grain,]] [[H5704|as well as]] [[H3754|the vineyards]] [[H2132|and olive groves.]] ^1505

[[H4310|“Who]] [[H6213|did]] [[H2063|this?”]] [[H6430|the Philistines]] [[H559|demanded.]] [[H8123|“It was Samson,]] [[H2860|the son-in-law]] [[H8554|of the Timnite,”]] [[H559|they were told.]] [[H3588|“For]] [[H802|his wife]] [[H5414|was given]] [[H4828|to his companion.”]] [[H6430|So the Philistines]] [[H5927|went up]] [[H8313|and burned]] [[H1|her and her father]] [[H784|to death.]] ^1506

[[H8123|And Samson]] [[H559|told them,]] [[H518|“Because]] [[H6213|you have done]] [[H2063|this,]] [[H2308|I will not rest]] [[H3588|until]] [[H5358|I have taken vengeance]] ^1507

[[H5221|And he struck]] [[H7785|them ruthlessly]] [[H1419|with a great]] [[H4347|slaughter,]] [[H3381|and then went down]] [[H3427|and stayed]] [[H5585|in the cave]] [[H5553|at the rock]] [[H5862|of Etam.]] ^1508

[[H6430|Then the Philistines]] [[H5927|went up,]] [[H2583|camped]] [[H3063|in Judah,]] [[H5203|and deployed themselves]] [[H3896|against Lehi.]] ^1509

[[H4100|“Why]] [[H5927|have you attacked]] [[H5921|us?”]] [[H559|said]] [[H376|the men]] [[H3063|of Judah.]] [[H559|The Philistines replied,]] [[H5927|“We have come]] [[H631|to arrest]] [[H8123|Samson]] [[H6213|and pay him back]] [[H834|for what]] [[H6213|he has done]] ^1510

[[H7969|In response, three]] [[H505|thousand]] [[H376|men]] [[H3063|of Judah]] [[H3381|went]] [[H413|to]] [[H5585|the cave]] [[H5553|at the rock]] [[H5862|of Etam,]] [[H559|and they asked]] [[H8123|Samson,]] [[H3808|“Do you not]] [[H3045|realize]] [[H3588|that]] [[H6430|the Philistines]] [[H4910|rule]] [[H4100|over us?

[[H559|But they said]] [[H3381|to him,  “We have come down]] [[H631|to arrest you]] [[H5414|and hand you over to]] [[H6430|the Philistines.”]] [[H8123|Samson]] [[H559|replied,]] [[H7650|“Swear]] [[H6435|to me  that]] [[H6293|you will not kill]] ^1512

[[H3808|“No,”]] [[H559|they answered,]] [[H3808|“we will not]] [[H4191|kill you,]] [[H3588|but]] [[H631|we will tie you up securely]] [[H5414|and hand you over to]] [[H3027|them.”]] [[H631|So they bound him]] [[H8147|with two]] [[H2319|new]] [[H5688|ropes]] [[H5927|and led him up]] [[H4480|from]] [[H5553|the rock.]] ^1513

[[H1931|When]] ⟨Samson⟩ [[H935|arrived]] [[H5704|in]] [[H3896|Lehi,]] [[H6430|the Philistines]] [[H7321|came out shouting]] [[H7125|against him.]] [[H7307|And the Spirit]] [[H3068|of the LORD]] [[H6743|came mightily]] [[H5921|upon him.]] [[H5688|The ropes]] [[H5921|on]] [[H2220|his arms]] [[H1961|became]] [[H1197|like burnt]] [[H6593|flax,]] [[H612|and the bonds]] [[H4549|broke loose]] [[H5921|from]] [[H3027|his hands.]] ^1514

[[H4672|He found]] [[H2961|the fresh]] [[H3895|jawbone]] [[H2543|of a donkey,]] [[H7971|reached out]] [[H3027|his hand]] [[H3947|and took it,]] [[H5221|and struck down]] [[H505|a thousand]] [[H376|men.]] ^1515

[[H8123|Then Samson]] [[H559|said:]] [[H3895|“With the jawbone]] [[H2543|of a donkey]] [[H2563|I have piled them]] [[H2563|into heaps.]] [[H3895|With the jawbone]] [[H2543|of a donkey]] [[H5221|I have slain]] [[H505|a thousand]] [[H376|men.”]] ^1516

[[H1961|And]] [[H3615|when had finished]] ⟨Samson⟩ [[H1696|speaking,]] [[H7993|he cast]] [[H3895|the jawbone]] [[H3027|from his hand;]] [[H7121|and he named]] [[H1931|that]] [[H4725|place]] [[H7437|Ramath-lehi.]] ^1517

[[H3966|And being very]] [[H6770|thirsty,]] ⟨Samson⟩ [[H7121|cried out]] [[H413|to]] [[H3068|the LORD,]] [[H859|“You]] [[H5414|have accomplished]] [[H2063|this]] [[H1419|great]] [[H8668|deliverance]] [[H3027|through]] [[H5650|Your servant.]] [[H6258|Must I now]] [[H4191|die]] [[H6772|of thirst]] [[H5307|and fall]] [[H3027|into the hands]] [[H6189|of the uncircumcised?”]] ^1518

[[H430|So God]] [[H1234|opened up]] [[H4388|the hollow place]] [[H3896|in Lehi,]] [[H4325|and water]] [[H3318|came out]] [[H4480|of it.]] [[H8354|When Samson drank,]] [[H7307|his strength]] [[H7725|returned,]] [[H2421|and he was revived.]] [[H5921|That is why]] [[H7121|he named it]] [[H5875|En-hakkore,]] [[H834|and it remains]] [[H3895|in Lehi]] [[H5704|to]] [[H2088|this]] [[H3117|day.]] ^1519

[[H8199|And judged]] ⟨Samson⟩ [[H3478|Israel]] [[H6242|for twenty]] [[H8141|years]] [[H3117|in the days]] [[H6430|of the Philistines.]] ^1520

[[H8123|One day Samson]] [[H1980|went]] [[H5804|to Gaza,]] [[H8033|where]] [[H7200|he saw]] [[H2181|a prostitute]] [[H935|and went in to spend the night]] [[H413|with her.]] ^1601

[[H5841|When the Gazites]] [[H8123|heard that Samson]] [[H2008|was there,]] [[H5437|they surrounded]] ⟨that place⟩ [[H693|and lay in wait]] [[H3605|for him  all]] [[H3915|night]] [[H5892|at the city]] [[H8179|gate.]] [[H2790|They were quiet]] [[H3605|throughout]] [[H3915|the night,]] [[H559|saying,]] [[H5704|“Let us wait until]] [[H216|dawn;]] [[H2026|then we will kill him.”]] ^1602

[[H8123|But Samson]] [[H7901|lay there]] [[H5704|only until]] [[H2677|midnight.]] [[H6965|Then he got up]] [[H270|and took hold]] [[H1817|of the doors]] [[H5892|of the city]] [[H8179|gate,]] [[H8147|along with the two]] [[H4201|gateposts,]] [[H5265|and pulled them out,]] [[H1280|bar]] [[H5973|and all.]] [[H7760|Then he put]] ⟨them⟩ [[H5921|on]] [[H3802|his shoulders]] [[H5927|and took]] [[H413|them to]] [[H7218|the top]] [[H2022|of the mountain]] [[H5921|overlooking]] [[H2275|Hebron.]] ^1603

[[H310|Some time later,]] ⟨Samson⟩ [[H157|fell in love with]] [[H802|a woman]] [[H5158|in the Valley]] [[H7796|of Sorek,]] [[H8034|whose name]] [[H1807|was Delilah.]] ^1604

[[H5633|The lords]] [[H6430|of the Philistines]] [[H5927|went]] [[H413|to her]] [[H559|and said,]] [[H6601|“Entice]] [[H853|him]] [[H7200|and find out]] [[H4100|the source of]] [[H1419|his great]] [[H3581|strength]] [[H4100|and how]] [[H3201|we can overpower]] [[H631|him  to tie him up]] [[H6031|and subdue him.]] [[H376|Then each one]] [[H587|of us]] [[H5414|will give]] [[H505|you  eleven hundred]] ⟨shekels⟩ [[H3701|of silver.]] ^1605

[[H1807|So Delilah]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H8123|Samson,]] [[H4994|“Please]] [[H5046|tell me]] [[H4100|the source]] [[H1419|of your great]] [[H3581|strength]] [[H4100|and how]] [[H631|you could be tied up]] [[H6031|and subdued.”]] ^1606

[[H8123|Samson]] [[H559|told her,]] [[H518|“If]] [[H631|they tie me up]] [[H7651|with seven]] [[H3892|fresh]] [[H3499|bowstrings]] [[H834|that]] [[H3808|have not]] [[H2717|been dried,]] [[H2470|I will become as weak]] [[H259|as any]] [[H120|other man.”]] ^1607

[[H5633|So the lords]] [[H6430|of the Philistines]] [[H5927|brought]] [[H7651|her  seven]] [[H3892|fresh]] [[H3499|bowstrings]] [[H834|that]] [[H3808|had not]] [[H2717|been dried,]] [[H631|and she bound him]] ^1608

[[H693|While the men]] [[H3427|were hidden]] [[H2315|in her  room,]] [[H559|she called out,]] [[H8123|“Samson,]] [[H6430|the Philistines]] ⟨are⟩ [[H5921|here!”]] [[H5423|But he snapped]] [[H3499|the bowstrings]] [[H834|like]] [[H6616|a strand]] [[H5296|of yarn]] [[H5423|breaks]] [[H7306|when it touches]] [[H784|the flame.]] [[H3581|So the source of his strength]] [[H3808|remained unknown.]] ^1609

[[H1807|Then Delilah]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H8123|Samson,]] [[H2048|“You have mocked]] [[H1696|me  and lied to me!]] [[H6258|Will you now]] [[H4994|please]] [[H5046|tell]] [[H4100|me how]] [[H631|you can be bound?”]] ^1610

[[H559|He replied,]] [[H518|“If]] [[H631|they tie me up]] [[H2319|with new]] [[H5688|ropes]] [[H834|that]] [[H3808|have never]] [[H6213|been used,]] [[H2470|I will become as weak]] [[H259|as any]] [[H120|other man.”]] ^1611

[[H1807|So Delilah]] [[H3947|took]] [[H2319|new]] [[H5688|ropes,]] [[H631|tied him up,]] [[H559|and called out,]] [[H8123|“Samson,]] [[H6430|the Philistines are]] [[H5921|here!”]] [[H693|But while the men]] [[H3427|were hidden]] [[H2315|in her room,]] [[H5423|he snapped]] [[H5921|the ropes off]] [[H2220|his arms]] [[H2339|like a thread.]] ^1612

[[H1807|Then Delilah]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H8123|Samson,]] [[H2048|“You have mocked]] [[H1696|me  and lied to me]] [[H2008|all along!]] [[H5046|Tell]] [[H4100|me how]] [[H631|you can be tied up.”]] [[H559|He told her,]] [[H518|“If]] [[H707|you weave]] [[H7651|the seven]] [[H4253|braids]] [[H7218|of my head]] [[H5973|into]] [[H4545|the web of a loom ”]] ⟨and fasten it with a pin, I will become as weak as any other man.⟩ ^1613

⟨So while he slept, Delilah took the seven braids of his hair and wove them into the web⟩ [[H8628|. Then she fastened]] [[H3489|the braids with a pin]] [[H559|and called]] [[H413|to him,]] [[H8123|“Samson,]] [[H6430|the Philistines]] ⟨are⟩ [[H5921|here!”]] [[H3364|But he awoke]] [[H8142|from his sleep]] [[H5265|and pulled out]] [[H3489|the pin]] [[H708|with the loom]] [[H4545|and the web.]] ^1614

[[H349|“How]] [[H559|can you say,]] [[H157|‘I love you,’”]] [[H559|she told him,]] [[H3820|“when your heart]] [[H369|is not]] [[H854|with me?]] [[H2088|This]] [[H7969|is the third]] [[H6471|time]] [[H2048|you have mocked]] [[H3808|me and failed]] [[H5046|to reveal]] [[H4100|to me  the source]] [[H3581|of your great strength!”]] ^1615

[[H1961|Finally, after]] [[H6693|she had pressed]] [[H3117|him daily]] [[H1697|with her words]] [[H509|and pleaded]] [[H5315|until he]] [[H7114|was sick]] [[H4191|to death,]] ^1616

[[H5046|he told]] [[H3605|her  all that was]] [[H3820|in his heart:]] [[H7218|“My hair]] [[H3808|has never]] [[H4177|been cut,]] [[H3588|because]] [[H589|I]] ⟨have been⟩ [[H5139|a Nazirite]] [[H430|to God]] [[H4480|from]] [[H517|my mother's]] [[H990|womb.]] [[H518|If]] [[H1548|I am shaved,]] [[H3581|my strength]] [[H5493|will leave me,]] [[H2470|and I will become as weak]] [[H1961|as]] [[H3605|any]] [[H120|other man.]] ^1617

[[H1807|When Delilah]] [[H7200|realized]] [[H3588|that]] [[H5046|he had revealed]] [[H3605|to her  his whole]] [[H3820|heart,]] [[H7971|she sent]] [[H559|this message]] [[H5633|to the lords]] [[H6430|of the Philistines:]] [[H5927|“Come up]] [[H6471|once more,]] [[H3588|for]] [[H5046|he has revealed]] [[H3605|to me  his whole]] [[H3820|heart.”]] [[H5633|Then the lords]] [[H6430|of the Philistines]] [[H5927|came]] [[H413|to her,]] [[H5927|bringing]] [[H3701|the money]] [[H3027|in their hands.]] ^1618

[[H3462|And having lulled him to sleep]] [[H5921|on]] [[H1290|her lap,]] [[H7121|she called]] [[H376|a man]] [[H1548|to shave off]] [[H7651|the seven]] [[H4253|braids]] [[H7218|of his head.]] [[H2490|In this way]] [[H6031|she began to subdue him,]] [[H3581|and his strength]] [[H5493|left him.]] ^1619

[[H559|Then she called out,]] [[H8123|“Samson,]] [[H6430|the Philistines]] ⟨are⟩ [[H5921|here!”]] [[H3364|When awoke]] ⟨Samson⟩ [[H8142|from his sleep,]] [[H559|he thought,]] [[H3318|“I will escape]] [[H6471|as I did before]] [[H5287|and shake myself free.”]] [[H1931|But he]] [[H3808|did not]] [[H3045|know]] [[H3588|that]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H5493|had departed]] [[H5921|from him.]] ^1620

[[H6430|Then the Philistines]] [[H270|seized him,]] [[H5365|gouged out]] [[H5869|his eyes,]] [[H3381|and brought him down]] [[H5804|to Gaza,]] [[H631|where he was bound]] [[H5178|with bronze shackles]] [[H1961|and forced]] [[H2912|to grind]] [[H1004|grain in the prison.]] ^1621

[[H8181|However, the hair]] [[H7218|of his head]] [[H2490|began]] [[H6779|to grow]] [[H834|back after]] [[H1548|it had been shaved.]] ^1622

[[H5633|Now the lords]] [[H6430|of the Philistines]] [[H622|gathered together]] [[H2076|to offer]] [[H1419|a great]] [[H2077|sacrifice]] [[H430|to their god]] [[H1712|Dagon.]] [[H8057|They rejoiced]] [[H559|and said,]] [[H430|“Our god]] [[H5414|has delivered]] [[H8123|Samson]] [[H341|our enemy]] [[H3027|into our hands.”]] ^1623

[[H5971|And when the people]] [[H7200|saw him,]] [[H1984|they praised]] [[H430|their god,]] [[H3588|saying:]] [[H430|“Our god]] [[H5414|has delivered]] [[H3027|into our hands]] [[H341|our enemy]] [[H2717|who destroyed]] [[H776|our land]] [[H834|and]] [[H7235|multiplied]] [[H2491|our dead.”]] ^1624

[[H1961|And]] [[H3820|while their hearts]] [[H2896|were merry,]] [[H559|they said,]] [[H7121|“Call]] [[H8123|for Samson]] [[H7832|to entertain us.”]] [[H7121|So they called]] [[H8123|Samson]] [[H1004|out of the prison]] [[H6711|to entertain them.]] [[H5975|And they stationed]] [[H853|him]] [[H996|between]] [[H5982|the pillars.]] ^1625

[[H8123|Samson]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H5288|the servant]] [[H2388|who held]] [[H3027|his hand,]] [[H3240|“Lead]] [[H853|me]] [[H3237|where I can feel]] [[H5982|the pillars]] [[H3559|supporting]] [[H1004|the temple,]] [[H8172|so I can lean]] [[H5921|against them.”]] ^1626

[[H1004|Now the temple]] [[H4390|was full of]] [[H376|men]] [[H802|and women;]] [[H3605|all]] [[H5633|the lords]] [[H6430|of the Philistines]] [[H8033|were there,]] [[H7969|and about three]] [[H505|thousand men]] [[H802|and women]] [[H5921|were on]] [[H1406|the roof]] [[H7200|watching]] [[H8123|Samson]] [[H7832|entertain them.]] ^1627

[[H8123|Then Samson]] [[H7121|called out]] [[H413|to]] [[H3068|the LORD:]] [[H136|“O Lord]] [[H3069|GOD,]] [[H4994|please]] [[H2142|remember me.]] [[H2388|Strengthen me,]] [[H430|O God,]] [[H389|just]] [[H6471|once more,]] [[H259|so that with one]] [[H5359|vengeful blow]] [[H5358|I may pay back]] [[H6430|the Philistines]] [[H8147|for my two]] [[H5869|eyes.”]] ^1628

[[H8123|And Samson]] [[H3943|reached out]] [[H8147|for the two]] [[H8432|central]] [[H5982|pillars]] [[H3559|supporting]] [[H1004|the temple.]] [[H5564|Bracing himself]] [[H5921|against them]] [[H3225|with his right hand]] [[H259|on one]] [[H8040|and his left hand]] [[H259|on the other,]] ^1629

[[H8123|Samson]] [[H559|said,]] [[H5315|“Let me]] [[H4191|die]] [[H5973|with]] [[H6430|the Philistines.”]] [[H5186|Then he pushed]] [[H3581|with all his might,]] [[H1004|and the temple]] [[H5307|fell]] [[H5921|on]] [[H5633|the lords]] [[H5921|and]] [[H3605|all]] [[H5971|the people in it.]] [[H4194|So in his death]] [[H4191|he killed]] [[H7227|more]] [[H834|than]] [[H4191|he had killed]] [[H2416|in his life.]] ^1630

[[H251|Then brothers]] ⟨Samson's⟩ [[H1|and his father’s]] [[H1004|family]] [[H3381|came down,]] [[H5927|carried him back,]] [[H6912|and buried]] [[H996|him between]] [[H6881|Zorah]] [[H847|and Eshtaol]] [[H6913|in the tomb]] [[H1|of his father]] [[H4495|Manoah.]] [[H1931|And he]] [[H8199|had judged]] [[H3478|Israel]] [[H6242|twenty]] [[H8141|years.]] ^1631

[[H1961|Now there was]] [[H376|a man]] [[H2022|from the hill country]] [[H669|of Ephraim]] [[H8034|named]] [[H4319|Micah.]] ^1701

[[H559|He said]] [[H517|to his mother,]] [[H505|“The eleven]] [[H3967|hundred]] ⟨shekels⟩ [[H3701|of silver]] [[H834|that]] [[H3947|were taken]] [[H1571|from  you  and]] [[H241|about which I heard]] [[H859|you]] [[H422|utter a curse—]] [[H2009|I have]] [[H3701|the silver]] ⟨here⟩ [[H854|with me;]] [[H589|I]] [[H3947|took it.”]] [[H517|Then his mother]] [[H559|said,]] [[H1288|“Blessed be]] [[H1121|my son]] [[H3068|by the LORD!”]] ^1702

[[H7725|And when he had]] [[H853|returned]] [[H505|the eleven]] [[H3967|hundred]] ⟨shekels⟩ [[H3701|of silver]] [[H517|to his mother,]] ⟨she⟩ [[H517|]] [[H559|said,]] [[H6942|“I wholly]] [[H6942|dedicate]] [[H3701|the silver]] [[H3068|to the LORD]] [[H1121|for my son’s]] [[H6213|benefit to make]] [[H6459|a graven image]] [[H4541|and a molten idol.]] [[H6258|Therefore I will now]] [[H7725|return it]] ^1703

[[H7725|So he returned]] [[H3701|the silver]] [[H517|to his mother,]] [[H517|and she]] [[H3947|took]] [[H3967|two hundred]] ⟨shekels⟩ [[H3701|of silver]] [[H5414|and gave]] [[H6884|them to a silversmith,]] [[H6213|who made them]] [[H6459|into a graven image]] [[H4541|and a molten idol.]] [[H1961|And they were placed]] [[H1004|in the house]] [[H4319|of Micah.]] ^1704

[[H376|Now this man]] [[H4318|Micah]] [[H1004|had a shrine,]] [[H6213|and he made]] [[H646|an ephod]] [[H8655|and some household idols,]] [[H4390|and installed]] [[H259|one]] [[H1121|of his sons]] [[H1961|to be]] [[H3548|his priest.]] ^1705

[[H1992|In those]] [[H3117|days]] [[H369|there was no]] [[H4428|king]] [[H3478|in Israel;]] [[H376|everyone]] [[H6213|did]] ⟨what was⟩ [[H3477|right]] [[H5869|in his own eyes.]] ^1706

[[H1961|And there was]] [[H5288|a young]] [[H3881|Levite]] [[H1035|from Bethlehem]] [[H3063|in Judah,]] [[H1931|who]] [[H1481|had been residing]] [[H4940|within the clan]] [[H3063|of Judah.]] ^1707

[[H376|This man]] [[H1980|left]] [[H5892|the city]] [[H1035|of  Bethlehem]] [[H3063|in Judah]] [[H1481|to settle]] [[H834|where]] [[H4672|he could find]] ⟨a place⟩. [[H6213|And as he traveled,]] [[H935|he came]] [[H5704|to]] [[H4318|Micah’s]] [[H1004|house]] [[H2022|in the hill country]] [[H669|of Ephraim.]] ^1708

[[H370|“Where]] [[H935|are you from?”]] [[H4318|Micah]] [[H559|asked]] [[H595|him.  “I]] [[H3881|am a Levite]] [[H1035|from Bethlehem]] [[H3063|in Judah,”]] [[H559|he replied,]] [[H595|“and I]] [[H1980|am on my way]] [[H1481|to settle]] [[H834|wherever]] [[H4672|I can find a place.”]] ^1709

[[H3427|“Stay]] [[H5978|with me,”]] [[H4318|Micah]] [[H559|said]] [[H1961|to him,  “and be]] [[H1|my father]] [[H3548|and priest,]] [[H595|and I]] [[H5414|will give]] [[H6235|you  ten]] ⟨shekels⟩ [[H3701|of silver]] [[H3117|per year,]] [[H6187|a suit]] [[H899|of clothes,]] [[H4241|and your provisions.”]] [[H3881|So the Levite]] [[H1980|went in]] ^1710

[[H2974|and agreed]] [[H3427|to stay]] [[H854|with]] ⟨him⟩ [[H376|,]] [[H5288|and the young man]] [[H1961|became]] [[H259|like a]] [[H1121|son]] ^1711

[[H4318|Micah]] [[H4390|ordained]] [[H3881|the Levite,]] [[H5288|and the young man]] [[H1961|became]] [[H3548|his priest]] [[H1961|and lived]] [[H4318|in]] ⟨his⟩ [[H1004|house.]] ^1712

[[H4318|Then Micah]] [[H559|said,]] [[H6258|“Now]] [[H3045|I know]] [[H3588|that]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H3190|will be good]] [[H3588|to me,  because]] [[H3881|a Levite]] [[H1961|has become]] [[H3548|my priest.”]] ^1713

[[H1992|In those]] [[H3117|days]] [[H369|there was no]] [[H4428|king]] [[H3478|in Israel,]] ⟨and⟩ [[H7626|the tribe]] [[H1839|of the Danites]] [[H1245|was looking for]] [[H5159|territory]] [[H3427|to occupy.]] [[H3588|For]] [[H5704|up to]] [[H1931|that]] [[H3117|time]] [[H3808|they had not]] [[H5307|come into]] [[H5159|an inheritance]] [[H8432|among]] [[H7626|the tribes]] [[H3478|of Israel.]] ^1801

[[H1121|So the Danites]] [[H7971|sent out]] [[H2568|five]] [[H376|men]] [[H4940|from their clans,]] [[H1121|valiant warriors]] [[H6881|from Zorah]] [[H847|and Eshtaol,]] [[H7270|to spy out]] [[H776|the land]] [[H2713|and explore it.]] [[H1980|“Go]] [[H2713|and explore]] [[H776|the land,”]] [[H559|they told them.]] ⟨The men⟩ [[H935|entered]] [[H2022|the hill country]] [[H669|of Ephraim]] [[H5704|and came to]] [[H1004|the house]] [[H4318|of Micah,]] [[H3885|where they spent the night.]] ^1802

[[H1992|And while they]] [[H5973|were near]] [[H4318|Micah’s]] [[H1004|house,]] [[H1992|they]] [[H5234|recognized]] [[H6963|the voice]] [[H5288|of the young]] [[H3881|Levite;]] [[H5493|so they went over]] [[H559|and asked]] [[H4310|him,  “Who]] [[H935|brought]] [[H1988|you here?]] [[H4100|What]] [[H859|are you]] [[H6213|doing]] [[H2088|in this]] ⟨place⟩? [[H4100|Why]] [[H6311|are you  here?]] ^1803

[[H4318|“Micah]] [[H6213|had done]] [[H2090|this]] [[H559|for me,”  he replied,]] [[H7936|“and he has hired me]] [[H1961|to be]] [[H3548|his  priest.”]] ^1804

[[H559|Then they said to him,]] [[H4994|“Please]] [[H7592|inqu]] [[H430|]] [[H3045|]] [[H587|]] [[H6743|]] [[H1870|]] ^1805

[[H3548|And the priest]] [[H559|told]] [[H1980|them,  “Go]] [[H7965|in peace.]] [[H3068|The LORD]] [[H5227|is watching over]] [[H1870|your journey.”]] ^1806

[[H2568|So the five]] [[H376|men]] [[H1980|departed]] [[H935|and came]] [[H3919|to Laish,]] [[H7200|where they saw]] [[H5971|that the people]] [[H3427|were living]] [[H983|securely,]] [[H4941|like]] [[H6722|the Sidonians,]] [[H8252|tranquil]] [[H982|and unsuspecting.]] [[H369|There was nothing]] [[H3637|lacking]] [[H776|in the land]] [[H3423|and no oppressive]] [[H6114|ruler.]] [[H1992|And they]] [[H7350|were far away]] [[H6722|from the Sidonians]] [[H369|and had no]] [[H1697|alliance]] [[H5973|with]] [[H120|anyone.]] ^1807

[[H935|When the men returned]] [[H413|to]] [[H6881|Zorah]] [[H847|and Eshtaol,]] [[H251|their brothers]] [[H559|asked]] [[H4100|them,  “What]] [[H859|did you find?”]] ^1808

[[H559|They answered,]] [[H6965|“Come on,]] [[H5927|let us go up]] [[H5921|against them,]] [[H3588|for]] [[H7200|we have seen]] [[H776|the land,]] [[H3966|and it is very]] [[H2896|good.]] [[H859|Why would you fail to act?]] [[H408|Do not]] [[H6101|hesitate]] [[H1980|to go there]] [[H3423|and take possession of]] [[H776|the land!]] ^1809

[[H5927|They went up]] [[H2583|and camped]] [[H7157|at Kiriath-jearim]] [[H3063|in Judah.]] [[H5921|That is why]] [[H1931|the]] [[H4725|place]] [[H310|west]] [[H7157|of Kiriath-jearim]] [[H7121|is called]] [[H4265|Mahaneh-dan]] [[H5704|to]] [[H2088|this]] [[H3117|day.]] ^1812

[[H2568|while the five]] [[H376|men]] [[H1980|who had gone]] [[H7270|to scout]] [[H776|out the land]] [[H935|went inside]] [[H3947|and took]] [[H6456|the graven image,]] [[H646|the ephod,]] [[H8655|the household idols,]] [[H853|and]] [[H4541|the molten idol,]] [[H3548|while the priest]] [[H5324|stood]] [[H6607|at the entrance]] [[H8179|of the gate]] [[H8337|with the six]] [[H3967|hundred]] [[H2296|armed]] [[H376|men.]] ^1817

[[H428|When they]] [[H935|entered]] [[H4318|Micah’s]] [[H1004|house]] [[H3947|and took]] [[H6459|the graven image,]] [[H646|the ephod,]] [[H8655|the household idols,]] [[H853|and]] [[H4541|the molten idol,]] [[H3548|the priest]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to them,]] [[H4100|“What]] [[H859|are you]] [[H6213|doing?”]] ^1818

[[H2790|“Be quiet,”]] [[H559|they told him.]] [[H7760|“Put]] [[H3027|your hand]] [[H5921|over]] [[H6310|your mouth]] [[H1980|and come]] [[H5973|with us]] [[H1961|and be]] [[H1|a father]] [[H3548|and a priest]] [[H2896|to us.

[[H3548|So the priest]] [[H3190|was glad]] [[H3947|and took]] [[H646|the ephod,]] [[H8655|the household idols,]] [[H853|and]] [[H6459|the graven image,]] [[H935|and went]] [[H7130|with]] [[H5971|the people.]] ^1820

[[H7760|Putting]] [[H2945|their small children,]] [[H4735|their livestock,]] [[H3520|and their possessions]] [[H6440|in front of them,]] [[H6437|they turned]] [[H1980|and departed.]] ^1821

[[H1992|After they]] [[H7368|were some distance]] [[H4318|from Micah’s]] [[H1004|house,]] [[H582|the men]] [[H1004|in the houses]] [[H5973|near]] [[H4318|Micah's]] [[H1004|house]] [[H2199|mobilized]] [[H1692|and overtook]] [[H1121|the Danites.]] ^1822

[[H7121|When they called out]] [[H413|after them,]] [[H1121|the Danites]] [[H5437|turned]] [[H6440|to face them]] [[H559|and said]] [[H4318|to Micah,]] [[H4100|“What is the matter]] [[H3588|with you that]] [[H2199|you have called out such a company?”]] ^1823

[[H559|He replied,]] [[H3947|“You took]] [[H430|the gods]] [[H6213|I had made,]] [[H3548|and my priest,]] [[H1980|and went away.]] [[H5750|What else]] [[H4100|do I have?]] [[H4100|How]] [[H559|can you say]] [[H413|to me,]] [[H4100|‘What is the matter with you?’”]] ^1824

[[H1121|The Danites]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to him,]] [[H408|“Do not]] [[H8085|raise]] [[H6963|your voice]] [[H5973|against us,]] [[H6435|or]] [[H4751|angry]] [[H376|men]] [[H6293|will attack you,]] [[H1004|and you and your family]] [[H622|will lose]] [[H5315|your lives.”]] ^1825

[[H1121|So the Danites]] [[H1980|went]] [[H1870|on their way,]] [[H6437|and Micah turned]] [[H7725|to go back]] [[H1004|home,]] [[H4318|because he]] [[H7200|saw]] [[H3588|that]] [[H1992|they]] [[H2389|were too strong]] [[H4480|for him.]] ^1826

[[H1992|After they]] [[H3947|had taken]] [[H4318|Micah's]] ⟨idols⟩ [[H834|]] [[H3548|and his priest,]] [[H935|they went]] [[H5921|to]] [[H3919|Laish,]] [[H5921|to]] [[H8252|a tranquil]] [[H982|and unsuspecting]] [[H5971|people,]] [[H5221|and they struck]] [[H853|them]] [[H2719|with their swords]] [[H8313|and burned down]] [[H5892|the city.]] ^1827

[[H369|There was no one]] [[H5337|to deliver them,]] [[H3588|because]] ⟨the city was⟩ [[H1931|]] [[H7350|far]] [[H6721|from Sidon]] [[H369|and had no]] [[H1697|alliance]] [[H5973|with]] [[H120|anyone;]] [[H1931|it]] [[H6010|was in a valley]] [[H834|near]] [[H1050|Beth-rehob.]] [[H1129|And the Danites rebuilt]] [[H5892|the city]] [[H3427|and lived]] ^1828

[[H7121|They named]] ⟨it⟩ [[H5892|]] [[H1835|Dan,]] [[H8034|after]] [[H1|their forefather]] [[H1835|Dan,]] [[H834|who]] [[H3205|was born]] [[H3478|to Israel—]] [[H199|though]] [[H5892|the city]] [[H7223|was formerly]] [[H8034|named]] [[H3919|Laish.]] ^1829

[[H1121|The Danites]] [[H6965|set up]] [[H6459|idols]] [[H3129|for themselves,  and Jonathan]] [[H1121|son of]] [[H1647|Gershom,]] [[H1121|the son]] [[H4519|of Moses,]] [[H1121|and his sons]] [[H1961|were]] [[H3548|priests]] [[H7626|for the tribe]] [[H1839|of Dan]] [[H5704|until]] [[H3117|the day]] [[H1540|of the captivity]] [[H776|of the land.]] ^1830

[[H7760|So they set up]] [[H4318|for themselves  Micah's]] [[H6459|graven image,]] [[H3605|and it was there the whole]] [[H3117|time]] [[H1004|the house]] [[H430|of God]] [[H1961|was]] [[H7887|in Shiloh.]] ^1831

[[H1992|In those]] [[H3117|days,]] [[H369|when there was no]] [[H4428|king]] [[H3478|in Israel,]] [[H3881|a Levite]] [[H1481|who lived]] [[H3411|in the remote]] [[H2022|hill country]] [[H669|of Ephraim]] [[H3947|took]] [[H6370|for himself  a concubine]] [[H1035|from  Bethlehem]] [[H3063|in Judah.]] ^1901

[[H6370|But she]] [[H2181|was unfaithful]] [[H5921|to him]] [[H1980|and left]] [[H853|him]] [[H413|to return to]] [[H1|her father’s]] [[H1004|house]] [[H413|in]] [[H1035|Bethlehem]] [[H3063|in Judah.]] [[H1961|After she had been]] [[H8033|there]] [[H702|four]] [[H2320|months,]] ^1902

[[H376|her husband]] [[H6965|got up]] [[H1980|and went]] [[H310|after her]] [[H1696|to speak]] [[H3820|kindly]] [[H5921|to her]] [[H7725|and bring her back,]] [[H5288|taking with him his servant]] [[H6776|and a pair]] [[H2543|of donkeys.]] [[H935|So brought him]] ⟨the girl⟩ [[H1|into her father's]] [[H1004|house,]] [[H5291|and when]] ⟨her⟩ [[H1|father]] [[H7200|saw him,]] [[H8055|he gladly]] [[H7125|welcomed him.]] ^1903

[[H2859|His father-in-law,]] [[H5291|the girl’s]] [[H1|father,]] [[H2388|persuaded him to stay,]] [[H3427|so he remained]] [[H854|with him]] [[H7969|three]] [[H3117|days,]] [[H398|eating,]] [[H8354|drinking,]] [[H3885|and lodging]] [[H8033|there.]] ^1904

[[H7243|On the fourth]] [[H3117|day,]] [[H7925|they got up early]] [[H1242|in the morning]] [[H6965|and prepared]] [[H1980|to go,]] [[H5291|but the girl’s]] [[H1|father]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H2860|his son-in-law,]] [[H5582|“Refresh]] [[H3820|your heart]] [[H6595|with a morsel]] [[H3899|of bread,]] [[H310|and then]] [[H1980|you can go.”]] ^1905

[[H3427|So they sat down]] [[H8147|and the two]] [[H398|of them ate]] [[H8354|and drank]] [[H3162|together.]] [[H5291|Then the girl’s]] [[H1|father]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H376|the man,]] [[H4994|“Please]] [[H2974|agree]] [[H3885|to stay overnight]] [[H3820|and let your heart]] [[H3190|be merry.”]] ^1906

[[H376|The man]] [[H6965|got up]] [[H1980|to go,]] [[H2859|but his father-in-law]] [[H6484|persuaded him,]] [[H3885|so he stayed]] [[H8033|there that night.]] ^1907

[[H2549|On the fifth]] [[H3117|day,]] [[H7925|he got up early]] [[H1242|in the morning]] [[H1980|to leave,]] [[H5291|but the girl’s]] [[H1|father]] [[H559|said,]] [[H4994|“Please]] [[H5582|refresh]] [[H3824|your heart.”]] [[H4102|So they waited]] [[H5704|until]] [[H5186|late afternoon]] [[H8147|and the two]] [[H398|of them ate.]] ^1908

[[H376|When the man]] [[H6965|got up]] [[H1980|to depart]] [[H6370|with his concubine]] [[H5288|and his servant,]] [[H2859|his father-in-law,]] [[H5291|the girl’s]] [[H1|father,]] [[H559|said]] [[H2009|to him,  “Look,]] [[H3117|the day]] [[H7503|is drawing]] [[H6150|late.]] [[H4994|Please]] [[H3885|spend the night.]] [[H2009|See,]] [[H3117|the day]] [[H2583|is almost over.]] [[H3885|Spend the night]] [[H6311|here,]] [[H3824|that your heart]] [[H3190|may be merry.]] [[H7925|Then you can get up early]] [[H4279|tomorrow]] [[H1870|for your journey]] [[H1980|and go]] [[H168|home.]] ^1909

[[H376|But the man]] [[H3808|was unwilling]] [[H3885|to spend the night.]] [[H6965|He got up]] [[H1980|and departed,]] [[H935|and arrived]] [[H5227|opposite]] [[H2982|Jebus]] [[H1931|(that is,]] [[H3389|Jerusalem),]] [[H5973|with]] [[H6776|his two]] [[H2280|saddled]] [[H2543|donkeys]] [[H6370|and his concubine.]] ^1910

[[H1992|When they]] [[H5973|were near]] [[H2982|Jebus]] [[H3117|and the day]] [[H3966|was almost]] [[H7286|gone,]] [[H5288|the servant]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H113|his master,]] [[H4994|“Please,]] [[H5493|let us stop]] [[H413|at]] [[H2063|this]] [[H2983|Jebusite]] [[H5892|city]] [[H3885|and spend the night]] ^1911

[[H113|But his master]] [[H559|replied,]] [[H3808|“We will not]] [[H5493|turn aside]] [[H413|to]] [[H5892|the city]] [[H5237|of foreigners,]] [[H834|where]] [[H3808|there are no]] [[H1121|Israelites.]] [[H5674|We will go on]] [[H5704|to]] [[H1390|Gibeah.”]] ^1912

[[H5493|They stopped]] [[H935|to go in]] [[H3885|and lodge]] [[H1390|in Gibeah.]] [[H935|The Levite went in]] [[H3427|and sat down]] [[H5892|in the city]] [[H7339|square,]] [[H369|but no]] [[H376|one]] [[H622|would take]] [[H853|them]] [[H1004|into his home]] [[H3885|for the night.]] ^1915

[[H6153|That evening]] [[H2205|an old]] [[H376|man]] [[H2022|from the hill country]] [[H669|of Ephraim,]] [[H1481|who was residing]] [[H1390|in Gibeah]] [[H376|(the men]] [[H4725|of that place]] [[H1145|were Benjamites)]] [[H935|came in]] [[H4480|from]] [[H4639|his work]] [[H4480|in]] [[H7704|the field.]] ^1916

[[H5375|When he looked up]] [[H7200|and saw]] [[H732|the traveler]] [[H5892|in the city]] [[H7339|square,]] [[H2205|the old]] [[H376|man]] [[H559|asked,]] [[H575|“Where]] [[H1980|are you going,]] [[H370|and where]] [[H935|have you come from?”]] ^1917

[[H935|When he reached]] [[H1004|his house,]] [[H3947|he picked up]] [[H3979|a knife,]] [[H2388|took hold]] [[H6370|of his concubine,]] [[H5408|cut her]] [[H6106|limb by limb]] [[H8147|into twelve]] [[H5409|pieces,]] [[H7971|and sent]] [[H3605|her throughout]] [[H1366|the territory]] [[H3478|of Israel.]] ^1929

[[H3605|Then all]] [[H1121|the Israelites]] [[H1835|from Dan]] [[H5704|to]] [[H884|Beersheba]] [[H776|and from the land]] [[H1568|of Gilead]] [[H3318|came out,]] [[H5712|and the congregation]] [[H6950|assembled]] [[H259|as one]] [[H376|man]] [[H413|before]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H4709|at Mizpah.]] ^2001

[[H376|The men]] [[H3478|of Israel]] [[H1961|had arranged]] [[H4150|a signal]] [[H5973|with]] [[H693|the men in ambush:]] [[H5927|When they sent up]] [[H7235|a great]] [[H4864|cloud]] [[H6227|of smoke]] [[H4480|from]] [[H5892|the city,]] ^2038

[[H376|the men]] [[H3478|of Israel]] [[H2015|would turn]] [[H4421|in the battle.]] [[H1144|When the Benjamites]] [[H2490|had begun]] [[H5221|to strike them down,]] [[H2491|killing]] [[H7970|about thirty]] [[H376|men]] [[H3478|of Israel,]] [[H559|they said,]] [[H1931|“They are]] [[H5062|defeated]] [[H6440|before us]] [[H7223|as in the first]] [[H4421|battle.”]] ^2039

[[H5982|But when the column]] [[H6227|of smoke]] [[H2490|began]] [[H5927|to go up]] [[H4480|from]] [[H5892|the city,]] [[H1144|the Benjamites]] [[H6437|looked]] [[H310|behind them]] [[H2009|and saw]] [[H3632|the whole]] [[H5892|city]] [[H5927|going up]] [[H8064|in smoke.]] ^2040

[[H1121|The Israelites]] [[H559|asked,]] [[H4310|“Who]] [[H3605|among all]] [[H7626|the tribes]] [[H3478|of Israel]] [[H3808|did not]] [[H5927|come]] [[H6951|to the assembly]] [[H413|before]] [[H3068|the LORD?”]] [[H3588|For]] [[H1961|they had taken]] [[H1419|a solemn]] [[H7621|oath]] [[H834|that anyone]] [[H3808|who failed]] [[H5927|to come up]] [[H413|before]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H4709|at Mizpah]] [[H4191|would surely be put to death.]] ^2105

[[H1121|And the Israelites]] [[H5162|grieved]] [[H413|for]] [[H251|their brothers,]] [[H1144|the Benjamites,]] [[H559|and said,]] [[H3117|“Today]] [[H259|a]] [[H7626|tribe]] [[H1438|is cut off]] [[H3478|from Israel.]] ^2106

[[H4100|What]] [[H6213|should we do]] [[H802|about wives]] [[H3498|for the survivors,]] [[H587|since we]] [[H7650|have sworn]] [[H3068|by the LORD]] [[H1115|not]] [[H5414|to give]] [[H1323|them  our daughters]] [[H802|in marriage?”]] ^2107

[[H559|So they asked,]] [[H4310|“Which]] [[H259|one]] [[H7626|of the tribes]] [[H3478|of Israel]] [[H3808|failed]] [[H5927|to come up]] [[H413|before]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H4709|at Mizpah?”]] [[H2009|And in fact,]] [[H3808|no one]] [[H3003|from Jabesh-gilead]] [[H935|had come]] [[H413|to]] [[H4264|the camp]] [[H6951|for the assembly.]] ^2108

[[H5971|For when the people]] [[H6485|were counted,]] [[H369|none]] [[H3427|of the residents]] [[H3003|of Jabesh-gilead]] [[H8033|were there.]] ^2109

[[H5712|So the congregation]] [[H7971|sent]] [[H8147|12,000]] [[H1121|of]] [[H2428|their most valiant]] [[H376|men]] [[H6680|and commanded them:]] [[H1980|“Go]] [[H5221|and put]] [[H2719|to the sword]] [[H3427|those living]] [[H3003|in Jabesh-gilead,]] [[H802|including women]] [[H2945|and children.]] ^2110

[[H2088|This]] [[H834|is what]] [[H6213|you are to do:]] [[H2763|Completely destroy]] [[H3605|every]] [[H2145|male,]] [[H3605|as well as every]] [[H802|female]] [[H3045|who has had relations with]] [[H2145|a man.”]] ^2111

[[H4672|So they found]] [[H3427|among the inhabitants]] [[H3003|of Jabesh-gilead]] [[H702|four]] [[H3967|hundred]] [[H5291|young]] [[H1330|women]] [[H834|who]] [[H3808|had not]] [[H3045|had relations with]] [[H2145|a man,]] [[H935|and they brought]] [[H413|them to]] [[H4264|the camp]] [[H7887|at Shiloh]] [[H776|in the land]] [[H3667|of Canaan.]] ^2112

[[H3605|Then the whole]] [[H5712|congregation]] [[H7971|sent]] [[H1696|a message]] [[H7965|of peace]] [[H413|to]] [[H1121|the Benjamites]] [[H834|who]] [[H5553|were at the rock]] [[H7417|of Rimmon.]] ^2113

[[H1931|And at that]] [[H6256|time]] [[H1144|the Benjamites]] [[H7725|returned]] [[H5414|and were given]] [[H802|the women]] [[H2421|who were spared]] [[H3003|from Jabesh-gilead.]] [[H3808|But there were not]] [[H3651|enough]] ⟨women⟩ ^2114

[[H5971|The people]] [[H5162|grieved]] [[H1144|for Benjamin,]] [[H3588|because]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H6213|had made]] [[H6556|a void]] [[H7626|in the tribes]] [[H3478|of Israel.]] ^2115

[[H2205|Then the elders]] [[H5712|of the congregation]] [[H559|said,]] [[H4100|“What]] [[H6213|should we do]] [[H802|about wives]] [[H3498|for those who remain,]] [[H3588|since]] [[H802|the women]] [[H1144|of Benjamin]] [[H8045|have been destroyed?”]] ^2116

[[H559|They added,]] [[H3425|“There must be heirs]] [[H6413|for the survivors]] [[H1144|of Benjamin,]] [[H7626|so that a tribe]] [[H3478|of Israel]] [[H3808|will not]] [[H4229|be wiped out.]] ^2117

[[H587|But we]] [[H3808|cannot]] [[H5414|give]] [[H1323|them our daughters]] [[H802|as wives.”]] [[H3588|For]] [[H1121|the Israelites]] [[H7650|had sworn,]] [[H779|“Cursed]] ⟨is⟩ [[H5414|he who gives]] [[H802|a wife]] [[H1144|to a Benjamite.”]] ^2118

[[H2009|“But look,”]] [[H559|they said,]] [[H3117|“there is a yearly]] [[H2282|feast]] [[H3068|to the LORD]] [[H7887|in Shiloh,]] [[H834|which]] ⟨is⟩ [[H6828|north]] [[H1008|of  Bethel]] [[H8121|east]] [[H4546|of the road]] [[H5927|that goes up]] [[H1008|from  Bethel]] [[H7927|to Shechem,]] [[H5045|and south]] [[H3829|of Lebonah.”]] ^2119

[[H6680|So they commanded]] [[H1121|the Benjamites:]] [[H1980|“Go,]] [[H693|hide]] [[H3754|in the vineyards]] ^2120

[[H7200|and watch.]] [[H518|When]] [[H2009|you see]] [[H1323|the daughters]] [[H7887|of Shiloh]] [[H3318|come out]] [[H2342|to perform]] [[H4246|their dances,]] [[H376|each of you]] [[H3318|is to come out]] [[H3754|of the vineyards,]] [[H2414|catch]] [[H802|for himself  a wife]] [[H4480|from]] [[H1323|the daughters]] [[H7887|of Shiloh,]] [[H1980|and go]] [[H776|to the land]] [[H1144|of Benjamin.]] ^2121

[[H3588|When]] [[H1|their fathers]] [[H176|or]] [[H251|brothers]] [[H935|come]] [[H413|to us]] [[H7378|to complain,]] [[H559|we will tell them,]] [[H2603|‘Do us a favor]] [[H853|by them,]] ⟨helping⟩ [[H3588|since]] [[H3808|we did not]] [[H3947|get]] [[H802|wives]] [[H376|for each of them]] [[H4421|in the war.]] [[H3588|Since]] [[H859|you]] [[H3808|did not]] [[H6256|actually]] [[H5414|give]] [[H816|them,  you have no guilt.]] ⟨your daughters⟩ ^2122

[[H1121|The Benjamites]] [[H6213|did]] ⟨as instructed⟩ [[H3651|]] [[H5375|and carried away]] [[H4557|the number]] [[H802|of women]] [[H4480|they needed from]] [[H2342|the dancers]] [[H1497|they caught.]] [[H1980|They went]] [[H7725|back]] [[H413|to]] [[H5159|their own inheritance,]] [[H1129|rebuilt]] [[H5892|their cities,]] [[H3427|and settled]] ^2123

[[H1931|And at that]] [[H6256|time,]] [[H376|each]] [[H1121|of the Israelites]] [[H1980|returned]] [[H8033|from there]] [[H7626|to his own tribe]] [[H4940|and clan,]] [[H376|each]] [[H5159|to his own inheritance.]] ^2124

[[H1992|In those]] [[H3117|days]] [[H369|there was no]] [[H4428|king]] [[H3478|in Israel;]] [[H376|everyone]] [[H6213|did]] ⟨what was⟩ [[H3477|right]] [[H5869|in his own eyes.]] ^2125
