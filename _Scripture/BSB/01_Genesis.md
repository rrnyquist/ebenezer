[[H3068|Then the LORD]] [[H430|God]] [[H559|said,]] [[H2005|“Behold,]] [[H120|the man]] [[H1961|has become]] [[H259|like one]] [[H4480|of Us,]] [[H3045|knowing]] [[H2896|good]] [[H7451|and evil.]] [[H6258|And now,]] [[H6435|lest]] [[H7971|he reach out]] [[H3027|his hand]] [[H3947|and take]] [[H1571|also]] [[H6086|from the tree]] [[H2416|of life,]] [[H398|and eat,]] [[H2425|and live]] [[H5769|forever...]] ^0322

[[H3068|And the LORD]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H7014|Cain,]] [[H335|“Where]] ⟨is⟩ [[H251|your brother]] [[H1893|Abel?”]] [[H595|“I]] [[H3808|do not]] [[H3045|know!”]] [[H559|he answered.]] [[H251|“ I my brother’s]] ⟨Am⟩ [[H8104|keeper?”]] ^0409

[[H559|And they said]] [[H413|to]] [[H376|one]] [[H7453|another,]] [[H3051|“Come,]] [[H3835|let us make]] [[H3843|bricks]] [[H8313|and bake]] [[H8316|them thoroughly.”]] [[H1961|So they used]] [[H3843|brick]] [[H68|instead of stone,]] [[H2564|and tar]] [[H2563|instead of mortar.]] ^1103

[[H3051|“Come,”]] [[H559|they said,]] [[H1129|“let us build]] [[H5892|for ourselves  a city]] [[H4026|with a tower]] [[H7218|that reaches]] [[H8064|to the heavens,]] [[H6213|that we may make]] [[H8034|a name for ourselves]] [[H6435|and not]] [[H6327|be scattered]] [[H5921|over]] [[H6440|the face]] [[H3605|of the whole]] [[H776|earth.”]] ^1104

[[H3068|Then the LORD]] [[H3381|came down]] [[H7200|to see]] [[H5892|the city]] [[H4026|and the tower]] [[H834|that]] [[H1121|the sons]] [[H120|of men]] [[H1129|were building.]] ^1105

[[H87|And Abram]] [[H5152|and Nahor]] [[H3947|took]] [[H802|wives]] ⟨for themselves⟩.

[[H3068|Then the LORD]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H87|Abram,]] [[H1980|“Leave]] [[H776|your country,]] [[H4138|your kindred,]] [[H1|and your father’s]] [[H1004|household,]] [[H413|and go to]] [[H776|the land]] [[H7200|I will show you.]] ^1201

[[H87|So Abram]] [[H1980|departed,]] [[H834|as]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H1696|had directed him,]] [[H3876|and Lot]] [[H1980|went]] [[H854|with him.]] [[H87|Abram]] [[H2568|was seventy-five]] [[H8141|years]] [[H1121|old]] [[H3318|when he left]] [[H2771|Haran.]] ^1204

[[H87|And Abram]] [[H3947|took]] [[H802|his wife]] [[H8297|Sarai,]] [[H1121|his nephew]] [[H3876|Lot,]] [[H3605|and all]] [[H7399|the possessions]] [[H5315|and people]] [[H6213|they had acquired]] [[H2771|in Haran,]] [[H3318|and set out]] [[H776|for the land]] [[H3667|of Canaan.]] [[H935|When they came]] [[H776|to the land]] [[H3667|of Canaan,]] ^1205

[[H87|Abram]] [[H5674|traveled]] [[H776|through the land]] [[H5704|to]] [[H4725|the site]] [[H5704|of]] [[H436|the oak]] [[H4176|of Moreh]] [[H7927|at Shechem.]] [[H227|And at that time]] [[H3669|the Canaanites]] [[H776|were in the land.]] ^1206

[[H3068|Then the LORD]] [[H7200|appeared]] [[H413|to]] [[H87|Abram]] [[H559|and said,]] [[H5414|“I will give]] [[H2063|this]] [[H776|land]] [[H2233|to your offspring.”]] [[H1129|So built]] ⟨Abram⟩ [[H4196|an altar]] [[H8033|there]] [[H3068|to the LORD,]] [[H7200|who had appeared]] [[H413|to him.]] ^1207

[[H8033|From there]] ⟨Abram⟩ [[H6275|moved on]] [[H2022|to the hill country]] [[H6924|east]] [[H1008|of  Bethel]] [[H5186|and pitched]] [[H168|his tent,]] [[H1008|with Bethel]] [[H3220|to the west]] [[H5857|and Ai]] [[H6924|to the east.]] [[H8033|There]] [[H1129|he built]] [[H4196|an altar]] [[H3068|to the LORD,]] [[H7121|and he called]] [[H8034|on the name]] [[H3068|of the LORD.]] ^1208

[[H87|And Abram]] [[H5265|journeyed on]] [[H5265|toward]] [[H5045|the Negev.]] ^1209

[[H1961|Now there was]] [[H7458|a famine]] [[H776|in the land.]] [[H87|So Abram]] [[H3381|went down]] [[H4714|to Egypt]] [[H8033|to live there]] [[H1481|for a while]] [[H3588|because]] [[H7458|the famine]] [[H3515|was severe.]] ^1210

[[H834|As]] [[H7126|he was about]] [[H935|to enter]] [[H4714|Egypt,]] [[H559|he said]] [[H413|to]] [[H802|his wife]] [[H8297|Sarai,]] [[H2009|“Look,]] [[H3045|I know]] [[H3588|that]] [[H859|you]] ⟨are⟩ [[H3303|a beautiful]] [[H802|woman,]] ^1211

[[H4994|Please]] [[H559|say that]] [[H859|you are]] [[H269|my sister,]] [[H4616|so that]] [[H3190|I will be treated well]] [[H5668|for your sake,]] [[H1558|and on account of you]] [[H5315|my life]] [[H2421|will be spared.”]] ^1213

[[H1961|So]] [[H87|when Abram]] [[H935|entered]] [[H4714|Egypt,]] [[H4713|the Egyptians]] [[H7200|saw]] [[H3588|that]] [[H802|the woman]] [[H3966|was very]] [[H3303|beautiful.]] ^1214

[[H6547|When Pharaoh’s]] [[H8269|officials]] [[H7200|saw]] ⟨Sarai⟩ [[H853|,]] [[H1984|they commended]] [[H413|her to]] ⟨him⟩ [[H6547|,]] [[H802|and she]] [[H3947|was taken]] [[H1004|into the palace]] [[H6547|of Pharaoh.]] ^1215

[[H87|He treated Abram]] [[H3190|well]] [[H5668|on her account,]] [[H1961|and Abram acquired]] [[H6629|sheep]] [[H1241|and cattle,]] [[H2543|male and female donkeys,]] [[H5650|menservants]] [[H8198|and maidservants,]] [[H1581|and camels.]] ^1216

[[H3068|The LORD, however,]] [[H5060|afflicted]] [[H6547|Pharaoh]] [[H1004|and his household]] [[H1419|with severe]] [[H5061|plagues]] [[H5921|because of]] [[H87|Abram’s]] [[H802|wife]] [[H8297|Sarai.]] ^1217

[[H6547|So Pharaoh]] [[H7121|summoned]] [[H87|Abram]] [[H559|and asked,]] [[H4100|“What]] [[H6213|have you done to me?]] [[H4100|Why]] [[H3808|did you not]] [[H5046|tell]] [[H1931|me she]] [[H802|was your wife?]] ^1218

[[H4100|Why]] [[H559|did you say,]] [[H1931|‘She is]] [[H269|my sister,’]] [[H3947|so that I took]] [[H802|her as my wife?]] [[H6258|Now then,]] [[H2009|here]] [[H802|is your wife.]] [[H3947|Take]] [[H1980|her and go!”]] ^1219

[[H6547|Then Pharaoh]] [[H376|gave his men]] [[H6680|orders]] [[H5921|concerning]] ⟨Abram⟩, [[H7971|and they sent him away]] [[H802|with his wife]] [[H3605|and all his possessions.]] ^1220

[[H87|So Abram]] [[H5927|went up]] [[H4714|out of Egypt]] [[H5045|into the Negev—]] [[H1931|he]] [[H802|and his wife]] [[H3605|and all his possessions—]] [[H3876|and Lot]] ⟨was⟩ [[H5973|with him.]] ^1301

[[H87|And Abram]] [[H3966|had become extremely]] [[H3513|wealthy]] [[H4735|in livestock]] [[H3701|and silver]] [[H2091|and gold.]] ^1302

[[H5045|From the Negev]] [[H1980|he journeyed]] [[H4550|from place to place]] [[H1008|toward  Bethel,]] [[H5704|until he came]] [[H5704|to]] [[H4725|the place]] [[H996|between]] [[H1008|Bethel]] [[H5857|and Ai]] [[H834|where]] [[H168|his tent]] [[H8462|had formerly]] [[H1961|been pitched,]] ^1303

[[H3876|Now Lot,]] [[H1980|who was traveling]] [[H854|with]] [[H87|Abram,]] [[H1571|also]] [[H1961|had]] [[H6629|flocks]] [[H1241|and herds]] [[H168|and tents.]] ^1305

[[H776|But the land]] [[H3808|was unable]] [[H5375|to support]] ⟨both of⟩ [[H853|them]] [[H3427|while they stayed]] [[H3162|together,]] [[H3588|for]] [[H1961|they had]] [[H7227|so many]] [[H7399|possessions]] [[H3201|that they were unable]] [[H3427|to coexist.]] ^1306

[[H1961|And there was]] [[H7379|discord]] [[H996|between]] [[H7473|the herdsmen]] [[H87|of Abram]] [[H7473|and the herdsmen]] [[H3876|of Lot.]] [[H227|At that time]] [[H3669|the Canaanites]] [[H6522|and the Perizzites]] [[H3427|were also living]] [[H776|in the land.]] ^1307

[[H3876|Lot]] [[H5375|looked out]] [[H7200|and saw]] [[H3605|that the whole]] [[H3603|plain]] [[H3383|of the Jordan,]] [[H935|all the way]] [[H6820|to Zoar,]] [[H4945|was well watered]] [[H1588|like the garden]] [[H3068|of the LORD,]] [[H776|like the land]] [[H4714|of Egypt.]] [[H6440|(This was before]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H7843|destroyed]] [[H5467|Sodom]] [[H6017|and Gomorrah.)]] ^1310

[[H87|Abram]] [[H3427|lived]] [[H776|in the land]] [[H3667|of Canaan,]] [[H3876|but Lot]] [[H3427|settled]] [[H5892|in the cities]] [[H3603|of the plain]] [[H167|and pitched tent]] ⟨his⟩ [[H5704|toward]] [[H5467|Sodom.]] ^1312

[[H376|But the men]] [[H5467|of Sodom]] [[H7451|were wicked,]] [[H2400|sinning]] [[H3966|greatly]] [[H3068|against the LORD.]] ^1313

[[H310|After]] [[H3876|Lot]] [[H6504|had departed,]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H87|Abram,]] [[H4994|“Now]] [[H5375|lift up]] [[H5869|your eyes]] [[H4480|from]] [[H4725|the place]] [[H834|where]] [[H859|you]] [[H8033|are,]] [[H7200|and look]] [[H6828|to the north]] [[H5045|and south]] [[H6924|and east]] [[H3220|and west.]] ^1314

[[H7760|I will make]] [[H2233|your offspring]] [[H6083|like the dust]] [[H776|of the earth,]] [[H834|so that]] [[H518|if]] [[H582|one]] [[H3201|could]] [[H4487|count]] [[H6083|the dust]] [[H776|of the earth,]] [[H1571|then]] [[H2233|your offspring]] [[H4487|could be counted.]] ^1316

[[H87|So Abram]] [[H167|moved his tent]] [[H935|and went]] [[H3427|to live]] [[H436|near the oaks]] [[H4471|of Mamre]] [[H2275|in Hebron,]] [[H8033|where]] [[H1129|he built]] [[H4196|an altar]] [[H3068|to the LORD.]] ^1318

[[H3117|In those days]] [[H569|Amraphel]] [[H4428|king]] [[H8152|of Shinar,]] [[H746|Arioch]] [[H4428|king]] [[H495|of Ellasar,]] [[H3540|Chedorlaomer]] [[H4428|king]] [[H5867|of Elam,]] [[H8413|and Tidal]] [[H4428|king]] [[H1471|of Goiim]] ^1401

[[H428|The latter]] ⟨five⟩ [[H3605|]] [[H2266|came as allies]] [[H413|to]] [[H6010|the Valley]] [[H7708|of Siddim]] [[H1931|(that is,]] [[H4417|the Salt]] [[H3220|Sea).]] ^1403

[[H8147|For twelve]] [[H8141|years]] [[H5647|they had been subject]] [[H3540|to Chedorlaomer,]] [[H7969|but in the thirteenth]] [[H8141|year]] [[H4775|they rebelled.]] ^1404

[[H702|In the fourteenth]] [[H8141|year,]] [[H3540|Chedorlaomer]] [[H4428|and the kings]] [[H834|who were]] [[H854|allied with him]] [[H935|went out]] [[H5221|and defeated]] [[H7497|the Rephaites]] [[H6255|in Ashteroth-karnaim,]] [[H2104|the Zuzites]] [[H1990|in Ham,]] [[H368|the Emites]] [[H7740|in Shaveh-kiriathaim,]] ^1405

[[H2752|and the Horites]] [[H2022|in the hill country]] [[H8165|of Seir,]] [[H5704|as]] [[H364|far as El-paran,]] [[H834|which]] ⟨is⟩ [[H5921|near]] [[H4057|the desert.]] ^1406

[[H7725|Then they turned back]] [[H935|to invade]] [[H5880|En-mishpat]] [[H1931|(that is,]] [[H6946|Kadesh),]] [[H5221|and they conquered]] [[H3605|the whole]] [[H7704|territory]] [[H6003|of the Amalekites,]] [[H1571|as]] [[H567|well as the Amorites]] [[H3427|who lived]] [[H2688|in Hazazon-tamar.]] ^1407

[[H4428|Then the king]] [[H5467|of Sodom,]] [[H4428|the king]] [[H6017|of Gomorrah,]] [[H4428|the king]] [[H126|of Admah,]] [[H4428|the king]] [[H6636|of Zeboiim,]] [[H4428|and the king]] [[H1106|of Bela]] [[H1931|(that is,]] [[H6820|Zoar)]] [[H3318|marched out]] [[H6186|and arrayed]] [[H4421|for battle]] [[H6010|in the Valley]] [[H7708|of Siddim]] ^1408

[[H6010|Now the Valley]] [[H7708|of Siddim]] [[H2564|was full of tar]] [[H875|pits,]] [[H4428|and as the kings]] [[H5467|of Sodom]] [[H6017|and Gomorrah]] [[H5127|fled,]] [[H5307|some men fell]] [[H8033|into]] ⟨the pits⟩, [[H7604|but the survivors]] [[H5127|fled]] [[H2022|to the hill country.]] ^1410

[[H3947|The seized]] ⟨four kings⟩ [[H3605|all]] [[H7399|the goods]] [[H5467|of Sodom]] [[H6017|and Gomorrah]] [[H3605|and all]] [[H400|their food,]] [[H1980|and they went on their way.]] ^1411

[[H3947|They also carried off]] [[H87|Abram’s]] [[H1121|nephew]] [[H3876|Lot]] [[H7399|and his possessions,]] [[H1931|since he]] [[H3427|was living]] [[H5467|in Sodom.]] ^1412

[[H6412|Then an escapee]] [[H935|came]] [[H5046|and reported]] ⟨this⟩ [[H87|to Abram]] [[H5680|the Hebrew.]] [[H1931|Now]] ⟨Abram⟩ [[H7931|was living]] [[H436|near the oaks]] [[H4471|of Mamre]] [[H567|the Amorite,]] [[H251|a brother]] [[H812|of Eshcol]] ⟨and⟩ [[H251|]] [[H6063|Aner,]] [[H1992|all of whom]] [[H1167|were bound]] [[H1285|by treaty]] [[H87|to Abram.]] ^1413

[[H87|And when Abram]] [[H8085|heard]] [[H3588|that]] [[H251|his relative]] [[H7617|had been captured,]] [[H7324|he assembled]] [[H8083|the 318]] [[H2593|trained men]] [[H3211|born]] [[H1004|in his household,]] [[H7291|and they set out in pursuit]] [[H5704|as]] [[H1835|far as Dan.]] ^1414

[[H3915|During the night,]] ⟨Abram⟩ [[H1931|]] [[H2505|divided]] [[H5650|his forces]] [[H5221|and routed]] ⟨Chedorlaomer’s army⟩, [[H7291|pursuing]] [[H5704|them as]] [[H2327|far as Hobah,]] [[H8040|north]] [[H1834|of Damascus.]] ^1415

[[H7725|He retrieved]] [[H3605|all]] [[H7399|the goods,]] [[H1571|as well as]] [[H251|his relative]] [[H3876|Lot]] [[H7399|and his possessions,]] [[H1571|together with]] [[H802|the women]] [[H5971|and the rest of the people.]] ^1416

[[H310|After]] [[H7725|Abram returned]] [[H5221|from defeating]] [[H3540|Chedorlaomer]] [[H4428|and the kings]] [[H854|allied with him,]] [[H4428|the king]] [[H5467|of Sodom]] [[H3318|went out]] [[H7125|to meet]] [[H413|him in]] [[H6010|the Valley]] [[H7740|of Shaveh]] [[H1931|(that is,]] [[H4428|the King’s]] [[H6010|Valley).]] ^1417

[[H4442|Then Melchizedek]] [[H4428|king]] [[H8004|of Salem]] [[H3318|brought out]] [[H3899|bread]] [[H3196|and wine—]] [[H1931|since he]] [[H3548|was priest]] [[H410|of God]] [[H5945|Most High—]] ^1418

[[H1288|and he blessed]] ⟨Abram⟩ [[H559|and said:]] [[H1288|“Blessed be]] [[H87|Abram]] [[H410|by God]] [[H5945|Most High,]] [[H7069|Creator]] [[H8064|of heaven]] [[H776|and earth,]] ^1419

[[H1288|and blessed be]] [[H410|God]] [[H5945|Most High,]] [[H834|who]] [[H4042|has delivered]] [[H6862|your enemies]] [[H3027|into your hand.”]] [[H5414|Then Abram gave]] ⟨Melchizedek⟩ [[H4643|a tenth]] [[H3605|of everything.]] ^1420

[[H4428|The king]] [[H5467|of Sodom]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H87|Abram,]] [[H5414|“Give]] [[H5315|me the people,]] [[H3947|but take]] [[H7399|the goods for yourself.”]] ^1421

[[H87|But Abram]] [[H559|replied]] [[H413|to]] [[H4428|the king]] [[H5467|of Sodom,]] [[H7311|“I have raised]] [[H3027|my hand]] [[H413|to]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H410|God]] [[H5945|Most High,]] [[H7069|Creator]] [[H8064|of heaven]] [[H776|and earth,]] ^1422

[[H518|that]] [[H518|I will not]] [[H3947|accept]] [[H5704|even]] [[H2339|a thread,]] [[H8288|or a strap]] [[H5275|of a sandal,]] [[H3605|or anything]] [[H834|that belongs to you,]] [[H3808|lest]] [[H559|you should say,]] [[H589|‘I]] ⟨have made⟩ [[H87|Abram]] [[H6238|rich.’]] ^1423

[[H1107|I will accept nothing]] [[H7535|but]] [[H834|what]] [[H5288|my men]] [[H398|have eaten]] [[H2506|and the share]] [[H376|for the men]] [[H834|who]] [[H1980|went]] [[H854|with me—]] [[H6063|Aner,]] [[H812|Eshcol,]] [[H4471|and Mamre.]] [[H1992|They]] [[H3947|may take]] [[H2506|their portion.”]] ^1424

[[H310|After]] [[H428|these]] [[H1697|events,]] [[H1697|the word]] [[H3068|of the LORD]] [[H1961|came]] [[H413|to]] [[H87|Abram]] [[H4236|in a vision:]] [[H408|“Do not]] [[H3372|be afraid,]] [[H87|Abram.]] [[H595|I]] ⟨am⟩ [[H4043|your shield,]] [[H3966|your very]] [[H7235|great]] [[H7939|reward.”]] ^1501

[[H87|But Abram]] [[H559|replied,]] [[H136|“O Lord]] [[H3069|GOD,]] [[H4100|what]] [[H5414|can You give me,]] [[H595|since I]] [[H1980|remain]] [[H6185|childless,]] [[H1121|and the heir]] [[H1004|of my house]] [[H461|is Eliezer]] [[H1834|of Damascus?”]] ^1502

[[H87|Abram]] [[H559|continued,]] [[H2005|“Behold,]] [[H5414|You have given]] [[H3808|me no]] [[H2233|offspring,]] [[H1121|so a servant]] [[H1004|in my household]] [[H3423|will be my heir.”]] ^1503

[[H2009|Then]] [[H1697|the word]] [[H3068|of the LORD]] [[H413|came to him,]] [[H559|saying,]] [[H2088|“This]] [[H3808|one will not]] [[H3423|be your heir,]] [[H3588|but]] [[H1931|one]] [[H834|who]] [[H3318|comes from]] [[H4578|your own body]] [[H3423|will be your heir.”]] ^1504

[[H3318|And took]] ⟨the LORD⟩ [[H853|him]] [[H2351|outside]] [[H559|and said,]] [[H4994|“Now]] [[H5027|look]] [[H8064|to the heavens]] [[H5608|and count]] [[H3556|the stars,]] [[H518|if you]] [[H3201|are able.”]] [[H559|Then He declared,]] [[H3541|“So]] ⟨shall⟩ [[H2233|your offspring]] [[H1961|be.”]] ^1505

[[H539|Abram believed]] [[H3068|the LORD,]] [[H2803|and it was credited]] [[H6666|to him  as righteousness.]] ^1506

⟨The LORD⟩ [[H559|also told]] [[H413|him,]] [[H589|“I]] [[H3068|am the LORD,]] [[H834|who]] [[H3318|brought you]] [[H218|out of Ur]] [[H3778|of the Chaldeans]] [[H5414|to give]] [[H2063|you  this]] [[H776|land]] [[H3423|to possess.”]] ^1507

[[H559|But replied,]] ⟨Abram⟩ [[H136|“Lord]] [[H3068|GOD,]] [[H4100|how]] [[H3045|can I know]] [[H3588|that]] [[H3423|I will possess it?”]] ^1508

[[H559|And said]] ⟨the LORD⟩ [[H413|to him,]] [[H3947|“Bring]] [[H5697|Me  a heifer,]] [[H5795|a goat,]] [[H352|and a ram,]] ⟨each⟩ [[H8027|three years old,]] [[H8449|along with a turtledove]] [[H1469|and a young pigeon.”]] ^1509

[[H3947|So brought]] ⟨Abram⟩ [[H3605|all]] [[H428|these to Him,]] [[H1334|split]] [[H853|each of them]] [[H8432|down the middle,]] [[H5414|and laid]] [[H1335|the halves]] [[H7125|opposite]] [[H376|each]] [[H7453|other.]] [[H6833|The birds,]] [[H853|however,]] [[H3808|he did not]] [[H1334|cut.]] ^1510

[[H5861|And the birds of prey]] [[H3381|descended]] [[H5921|on]] [[H6297|the carcasses,]] [[H87|but Abram]] [[H5380|drove them away.]] ^1511

[[H8121|As the sun]] [[H1961|was]] [[H935|setting,]] [[H87|Abram]] [[H5307|fell]] [[H5921|into]] [[H8639|a deep sleep,]] [[H2009|and suddenly]] [[H1419|great]] [[H367|terror]] [[H2825|and darkness]] [[H5307|overwhelmed]] [[H5921|him.]] ^1512

[[H559|Then the LORD said]] [[H87|to Abram,]] [[H3045|“Know]] [[H3045|for certain]] [[H3588|that]] [[H2233|your descendants]] [[H1961|will be]] [[H1616|strangers]] [[H776|in a land]] [[H3808|that is not their own;]] [[H5647|they will be enslaved]] [[H6031|and mistreated]] [[H702|four]] [[H3967|hundred]] [[H8141|years.]] ^1513

[[H1571|But]] [[H595|I]] [[H1777|will judge]] [[H1471|the nation]] [[H5647|they serve as slaves,]] [[H310|and afterward]] [[H3318|they will depart]] [[H1419|with many]] [[H7399|possessions.]] ^1514

[[H859|You, however,]] [[H935|will go]] [[H413|to]] [[H1|your fathers]] [[H7965|in peace]] [[H6912|and be buried]] [[H7872|at a ripe old age.]] ^1515

[[H7243|In the fourth]] [[H1755|generation]] ⟨your descendants⟩ [[H7725|will return]] [[H2008|here,]] [[H3588|for]] [[H5771|the iniquity]] [[H567|of the Amorites]] ⟨is⟩ [[H3808|not]] [[H5704|yet]] [[H8003|complete.”]] ^1516

[[H8121|When the sun]] [[H935|had set]] [[H5939|and darkness]] [[H1961|had fallen,]] [[H2009|behold,]] [[H6227|a smoking]] [[H8574|firepot]] [[H784|and a flaming]] [[H3940|torch]] [[H5674|appeared and passed]] [[H996|between]] [[H1506|the halves]] ⟨of the carcasses⟩ [[H428|.]] ^1517

[[H1931|On that]] [[H3117|day]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H3772|made]] [[H1285|a covenant]] [[H854|with]] [[H87|Abram,]] [[H559|saying,]] [[H2233|“To your descendants]] [[H5414|I have given]] [[H2063|this]] [[H776|land—]] [[H5104|from the river]] [[H4714|of Egypt]] [[H5704|to]] [[H1419|the great]] [[H5104|River]] [[H6578|Euphrates—]] ^1518

[[H87|Now Abram’s]] [[H802|wife]] [[H8297|Sarai]] [[H3808|had not]] [[H3205|borne a child]] [[H4713|to him,  but  she had an Egyptian]] [[H8198|maidservant]] [[H8034|named]] [[H1904|Hagar.]] ^1601

[[H8297|So Sarai]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H87|Abram,]] [[H2009|“Look]] [[H4994|now,]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H6113|has prevented me]] [[H3205|from bearing children.]] [[H4994|Please]] [[H935|go]] [[H413|to]] [[H8198|my maidservant;]] [[H194|perhaps]] [[H1129|I can build a family]] [[H4480|by her.”]] [[H87|Abram]] [[H8085|listened]] [[H6963|to the voice]] [[H8297|of Sarai.]] ^1602

[[H7093|So after]] ⟨he⟩ [[H87|]] [[H3427|had lived]] [[H3667|in Canaan]] [[H6235|for ten]] [[H8141|years,]] ⟨his⟩ [[H87|]] [[H802|wife]] [[H8297|Sarai]] [[H3947|took]] [[H4713|her Egyptian]] [[H8198|maidservant]] [[H1904|Hagar]] [[H5414|and gave]] [[H853|her]] [[H87|to Abram]] [[H802|to be his wife.]] ^1603

[[H935|And he slept with]] [[H1904|Hagar,]] [[H2029|and she conceived.]] [[H7200|But when realized]] ⟨Hagar⟩ [[H3588|that]] [[H2029|she was pregnant,]] [[H7043|she began to despise]] [[H1404|her mistress.]] ^1604

[[H8297|Then Sarai]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H87|Abram,]] [[H2555|“May the wrong done to me]] ⟨be⟩ [[H5921|upon you!]] [[H595|I]] [[H5414|delivered]] [[H8198|my servant]] [[H2436|into your arms,]] [[H7200|and ever since she saw]] [[H3588|that]] [[H2029|she was pregnant,]] [[H7043|she has treated me with contempt.]] [[H3068|May the LORD]] [[H8199|judge]] [[H996|between you and me.”]] ^1605

[[H2009|“Here,”]] [[H559|said]] [[H87|Abram,]] [[H8198|“your servant]] [[H3027|is in your hands.]] [[H6213|Do]] [[H2896|whatever you want]] [[H5869|with her.”]] [[H8297|Then Sarai]] [[H6031|treated]] ⟨Hagar⟩ [[H1272|so harshly that she fled]] [[H6440|from her.]] ^1606

[[H4397|Now the Angel]] [[H3068|of the LORD]] [[H4672|found]] ⟨Hagar⟩ [[H5921|by]] [[H5869|a spring]] [[H4325|of water]] [[H4057|in the desert—]] [[H5869|the spring]] [[H1870|along the road]] [[H7793|to Shur.]] ^1607

[[H1904|“Hagar,]] [[H8198|servant]] [[H8297|of Sarai,”]] [[H559|He said,]] [[H335|“where]] [[H935|have you come from,]] [[H575|and where]] [[H1980|are you going?”]] [[H595|“I am]] [[H1272|running away]] [[H6440|from]] [[H1404|my mistress]] [[H8297|Sarai,”]] [[H559|she replied.]] ^1608

[[H4397|So the Angel]] [[H3068|of the LORD]] [[H559|told]] [[H7725|her,  “Return]] [[H413|to]] [[H1404|your mistress]] [[H6031|and submit]] [[H8478|to her authority.”]] ^1609

[[H4397|Then the Angel]] [[H559|added,]] [[H7235|“I will greatly multiply]] [[H2233|your offspring]] [[H3808|so that]] [[H7230|they will be too numerous]] [[H5608|to count.”]] ^1610

[[H4397|The Angel]] [[H3068|of the LORD]] [[H559|proceeded:]] [[H2009|“Behold,]] [[H2030|you have conceived]] [[H3205|and will bear]] [[H1121|a son.]] [[H7121|And you shall name]] [[H3458|him Ishmael,]] [[H3588|for]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H8085|has heard]] [[H6040|your cry of affliction.]] ^1611

[[H7121|So gave]] ⟨Hagar⟩ [[H8034|this name]] [[H3068|to the LORD]] [[H1696|who had spoken]] [[H413|to her:]] [[H859|“You are]] [[H410|the God]] [[H7210|who sees me,”]] [[H3588|for]] [[H559|she said,]] [[H1988|“Here]] [[H1571|I have]] [[H7200|seen]] [[H7200|the One who sees me!”]] ^1613

[[H5921|Therefore]] [[H875|the well]] [[H7121|was called]] [[H883|Beer-lahai-roi.]] [[H2009|It is located]] [[H996|between]] [[H6946|Kadesh]] [[H1260|and Bered.]] ^1614

[[H1904|And Hagar]] [[H3205|bore]] [[H87|Abram]] [[H1121|a son,]] [[H87|and Abram]] [[H7121|gave]] [[H8034|the name]] [[H3458|Ishmael]] [[H1121|to the son]] ⟨she⟩ [[H1904|]] [[H3205|had borne.]] ^1615

[[H87|Abram]] [[H8084|was eighty-six]] [[H8141|years]] [[H1121|old]] [[H1904|when Hagar]] [[H3205|bore]] [[H3458|Ishmael]] [[H87|to him.]] ^1616

[[H87|Then Abram]] [[H5307|fell facedown,]] [[H430|and God]] [[H1696|said]] [[H854|to him,]] ^1703

[[H589|“As for Me,]] [[H2009|this is]] [[H1285|My covenant]] [[H854|with you:]] [[H1961|You will be]] [[H1|the father]] [[H1995|of many]] [[H1471|nations.]] ^1704

[[H430|God]] [[H559|also said]] [[H413|to]] [[H85|Abraham,]] [[H859|“As for you,]] [[H8104|you must keep]] [[H1285|My covenant,]] [[H859|you]] [[H2233|and your descendants]] [[H1755|for the generations]] [[H310|to come.]] ^1709

[[H853|But]] [[H6965|I will establish]] [[H1285|My covenant]] [[H854|with]] [[H3327|Isaac,]] [[H834|whom]] [[H8283|Sarah]] [[H3205|will bear]] [[H2088|to you  at this]] [[H4150|time]] [[H312|next]] [[H8141|year.”]] ^1721

[[H3615|When He had finished]] [[H1696|talking]] [[H854|with]] ⟨Abraham⟩, [[H430|God]] [[H5927|went up]] [[H5921|from]] ⟨him⟩ [[H85|.]] ^1722

[[H85|Then Abraham]] [[H3947|took]] [[H1121|his son]] [[H3458|Ishmael]] [[H3605|and all]] [[H3211|those born]] [[H1004|in his household]] [[H4736|or purchased]] [[H3701|with his money—]] [[H3605|every]] [[H2145|male]] [[H376|among the members]] [[H85|of Abraham’s]] [[H1004|household—]] [[H4135|and he circumcised them]] [[H2088|that]] [[H6106|very]] [[H3117|day,]] [[H834|just as]] [[H430|God]] [[H1696|had told]] [[H854|him.]] ^1723

[[H85|So Abraham]] [[H8673|was ninety-nine]] [[H1121|years old]] [[H4135|when he was circumcised,]] ^1724

[[H1121|and his son]] [[H3458|Ishmael]] [[H7969|was thirteen;]] ^1725

[[H85|Abraham]] [[H1121|and his son]] [[H3458|Ishmael]] [[H4135|were circumcised]] [[H2088|on the]] [[H6106|same]] [[H3117|day.]] ^1726

[[H3605|And all]] [[H376|the men]] [[H1004|of household—]] ⟨Abraham’s⟩ [[H3211|both servants born]] [[H1004|in his household]] [[H4736|and those purchased]] [[H1121|from foreigners—]] [[H4135|were circumcised with him.]] ^1727

[[H3068|Then the LORD]] [[H7200|appeared]] [[H413|to]] [[H436|Abraham by the oaks]] [[H4471|of Mamre]] [[H2527|in the heat]] [[H3117|of the day,]] [[H1931|while he]] [[H3427|was sitting]] [[H6607|at the entrance]] [[H168|to his tent.]] ^1801

[[H5375|And lifted up]] ⟨Abraham⟩ [[H5869|his eyes]] [[H7200|and saw]] [[H7969|three]] [[H376|men]] [[H5324|standing]] [[H5921|nearby.]] [[H7200|When he saw them,]] [[H7323|he ran from]] [[H6607|the entrance]] [[H168|of his tent]] [[H7125|to meet them]] [[H7812|and bowed low]] [[H776|to the ground.]] ^1802

[[H113|“My lord,”]] [[H559|said]] ⟨Abraham⟩, [[H518|“if]] [[H4672|I have found]] [[H2580|favor]] [[H5869|in your sight,]] [[H4994|please]] [[H408|do not]] [[H5674|pass]] [[H5650|your servant]] ⟨by⟩. ^1803

[[H4592|Let a little]] [[H4325|water]] [[H3947|be brought,]] [[H7364|that you may wash]] [[H7272|your feet]] [[H8172|and rest]] [[H8478|yourselves under]] [[H6086|the tree.]] ^1804

[[H3947|And I will bring]] [[H6595|a bit]] [[H3899|of bread]] [[H5582|so that you may refresh]] [[H3820|yourselves.]] [[H3588|This is why]] [[H5674|you have passed]] [[H5650|your servant’s way.]] [[H310|After that,]] [[H5674|you may continue on your way.”]] [[H3651|“Yes,”]] [[H559|they replied,]] [[H6213|“you may do]] [[H834|as]] [[H1696|you have said.”]] ^1805

[[H85|So Abraham]] [[H4116|hurried]] [[H168|into the tent]] [[H559|and said]] [[H413|to]] [[H8283|Sarah,]] [[H4116|“Quick! Prepare]] [[H7969|three]] [[H5429|seahs]] [[H5560|of fine]] [[H7058|flour,]] [[H3888|knead it,]] [[H6213|and bake]] [[H5692|some bread.”]] ^1806

[[H85|Meanwhile, Abraham]] [[H7323|ran]] [[H413|to]] [[H1241|the herd,]] [[H3947|selected]] [[H7390|a tender,]] [[H2896|choice]] [[H1121|calf,]] [[H5414|and gave]] [[H413|it to]] [[H5288|a servant,]] [[H4116|who hurried]] [[H6213|to prepare it.]] ^1807

[[H3947|Then Abraham brought]] [[H2529|curds]] [[H2461|and milk]] [[H1121|and the calf]] [[H834|that]] [[H6213|had been prepared,]] [[H5414|and he set]] [[H6440|them before the men]] [[H1931|and]] [[H5975|stood]] [[H5921|by them]] [[H8478|under]] [[H6086|the tree]] [[H398|as they ate.]] ^1808

[[H346|“Where]] [[H802|is your wife]] [[H8283|Sarah?”]] [[H559|they asked.]] [[H2009|“There,]] [[H168|in the tent,”]] [[H559|he replied.]] ^1809

[[H559|Then the LORD said,]] [[H7725|“I will surely]] [[H7725|return]] [[H413|to you]] [[H6256|at this time next year,]] [[H802|and your wife]] [[H8283|Sarah]] [[H1121|will have a son!”]] [[H8283|Now Sarah]] [[H310|was behind him,]] [[H8085|listening]] [[H6607|at the entrance]] [[H168|to the tent.]] ^1810

[[H85|And Abraham]] [[H8283|and Sarah]] [[H2205|were already old]] [[H935|and well along]] [[H3117|in years.]] [[H8283|Sarah]] [[H2308|had passed]] [[H734|the age of childbearing.]] ^1811

[[H8283|So]] ⟨she⟩ [[H6711|laughed]] [[H7130|to herself,]] [[H559|saying,]] [[H310|“After]] [[H1086|I am worn out]] [[H113|and my master]] [[H2204|is old,]] [[H1961|will I now have]] [[H5730|this pleasure?”]] ^1812

[[H3068|And the LORD]] [[H559|asked]] [[H85|Abraham,]] [[H4100|“Why]] [[H8283|did Sarah]] [[H6711|laugh]] [[H559|and say,]] [[H637|‘Can I really]] [[H3205|bear a child]] [[H589|when I am]] [[H2204|old?’]] ^1813

[[H1697|Is anything]] [[H6381|too difficult]] [[H3068|for the LORD?]] [[H4150|At the appointed time]] [[H7725|I will return]] [[H413|to you—]] [[H6256|in about a year—]] [[H8283|and Sarah]] [[H1121|will have a son.”]] ^1814

[[H8283|But Sarah]] [[H3584|denied it,]] [[H559|saying,]] [[H3808|“I did not]] [[H6711|laugh.”]] [[H3588|For]] [[H3372|she was afraid.]] [[H3808|“No,”]] [[H559|replied]] ⟨the LORD⟩, [[H3588|“but you did]] [[H6711|laugh.”]] ^1815

[[H6965|When got up]] ⟨the men⟩ [[H8033|to leave]] ⟨they⟩ [[H582|]] [[H8259|looked out]] [[H5921|over]] [[H5467|Sodom,]] [[H85|and Abraham]] [[H1980|walked along]] [[H5973|with]] [[H7971|them to see them off.]] ^1816

[[H3068|And the LORD]] [[H559|said,]] [[H589|“Shall I]] [[H3680|hide]] [[H85|from Abraham]] [[H834|what]] [[H589|I]] [[H6213|am about to do?]] ^1817

[[H85|Abraham]] ⟨will⟩ [[H1961|surely]] [[H1961|become]] [[H1419|a great]] [[H6099|and powerful]] [[H1471|nation,]] [[H3605|and through him  all]] [[H1471|the nations]] [[H776|of the earth]] ⟨will⟩ [[H1288|be blessed.]] ^1818

[[H3588|For]] [[H3045|I have chosen]] [[H4616|him,]] [[H834|so that]] [[H6680|he will command]] [[H1121|his children]] [[H853|and]] [[H1004|his household]] [[H310|after]] [[H8104|him to keep]] [[H1870|the way]] [[H3068|of the LORD]] [[H6213|by doing]] [[H6666|what is right]] [[H4941|and just,]] [[H4616|in order that]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H935|may bring]] [[H5921|upon]] [[H85|Abraham]] [[H834|what]] [[H1696|He has promised.]] ^1819

[[H3068|Then the LORD]] [[H559|said,]] [[H2201|“The outcry]] [[H5467|against Sodom]] [[H6017|and Gomorrah]] [[H7227|is great.]] [[H3588|Because]] [[H2403|their sin]] [[H3966|is so]] [[H3513|grievous,]] ^1820

[[H3381|I will go down]] [[H7200|to see]] [[H6213|if their actions]] [[H3617|fully]] [[H6818|justify the outcry]] [[H935|that has reached]] [[H413|Me.]] [[H518|If]] [[H3808|not,]] [[H3045|I will find out.”]] ^1821

[[H376|And men]] ⟨the two⟩ [[H6437|turned]] [[H8033|away]] [[H1980|and went]] [[H5467|toward Sodom,]] [[H85|but Abraham]] [[H5750|remained]] [[H5975|standing]] [[H6440|before]] [[H3068|the LORD.]] ^1822

[[H85|Abraham]] [[H5066|stepped forward]] [[H559|and said,]] [[H637|“Will You really]] [[H5595|sweep away]] [[H6662|the righteous]] [[H5973|with]] [[H7563|the wicked?]] ^1823

[[H194|What if]] [[H3426|there are]] [[H2572|fifty]] [[H6662|righteous]] [[H8432|ones in]] [[H5892|the city?]] [[H637|Will You really]] [[H5595|sweep it away]] [[H3808|and not]] [[H5375|spare]] [[H4725|the place]] [[H4616|for the sake of]] [[H2572|the fifty]] [[H6662|righteous]] [[H834|ones]] [[H7130|who are there?]] ^1824

[[H2486|Far be it from You]] [[H6213|to do]] [[H2088|such]] [[H1697|a thing—]] [[H4191|to kill]] [[H6662|the righteous]] [[H5973|with]] [[H7563|the wicked,]] [[H6662|so that the righteous]] [[H7563|and the wicked]] [[H1961|are treated alike.]] [[H2486|Far be it from You!]] [[H3808|Will not]] [[H8199|the Judge]] [[H3605|of all]] [[H776|the earth]] [[H6213|do]] [[H4941|what is right?”]] ^1825

[[H3068|So the LORD]] [[H559|replied,]] [[H518|“If]] [[H4672|I find]] [[H2572|fifty]] [[H6662|righteous ones]] [[H8432|within]] [[H5892|the city]] [[H5467|of Sodom,]] [[H5668|on their account]] [[H5375|I will spare]] [[H3605|the whole]] [[H4725|place.”]] ^1826

[[H85|Then Abraham]] [[H6030|answered,]] [[H2009|“Now that]] [[H2974|I have ventured]] [[H1696|to speak]] [[H413|to]] [[H136|the Lord—]] [[H595|though I]] [[H6083|am but dust]] [[H665|and ashes—]] ^1827

[[H559|and said,]] [[H113|“My lords,]] [[H4994|please]] [[H5493|turn aside]] [[H413|into]] [[H1004|the house]] [[H5650|of your servant;]] [[H7364|wash]] [[H7272|your feet]] [[H3885|and spend the night.]] [[H7925|Then you can rise early]] [[H1980|and go]] [[H1870|on your way.”]] [[H3808|“No,”]] [[H559|they answered,]] [[H3885|“we will spend the night]] [[H7339|in the square.”]] ^1902

[[H6484|But insisted]] ⟨Lot⟩ [[H3966|so strongly]] [[H5493|that they followed]] [[H413|him]] [[H413|into]] [[H1004|his house.]] [[H6213|He prepared]] [[H4960|a feast]] [[H644|for them  and baked]] [[H4682|unleavened bread,]] [[H398|and they ate.]] ^1903

[[H2962|Before]] [[H7901|they had gone to bed,]] [[H3605|all]] [[H582|the men]] [[H5892|of the city]] [[H5467|of Sodom,]] [[H5288|both young]] [[H5704|and]] [[H2205|old,]] [[H5437|surrounded]] [[H1004|the house.]] ^1904

[[H7121|They called out]] [[H413|to]] [[H3876|Lot,]] [[H559|saying,]] [[H346|“Where]] [[H376|are the men]] [[H834|who]] [[H935|came]] [[H413|to you tonight?]] [[H3318|Send them out]] [[H413|to us]] [[H3045|so we can have relations]] [[H853|with them!”]] ^1905

[[H3876|Lot]] [[H3318|went]] [[H6607|outside]] [[H413|to meet them]] [[H5462|and shut]] [[H1817|the door]] [[H310|behind him.]] ^1906

[[H4994|“Please,]] [[H251|my brothers,”]] [[H559|he pleaded,]] [[H408|“don’t]] [[H7489|do such a wicked thing!]] ^1907

[[H2009|Look,]] [[H8147|I have two]] [[H1323|daughters]] [[H834|who]] [[H3808|have never]] [[H3045|slept with]] [[H376|a man.]] [[H3318|Let me bring them]] [[H413|to you,]] [[H6213|and you can do]] [[H2896|to them  whatever you want.]] [[H7535|But]] [[H408|do not]] [[H6213|do]] [[H1697|anything]] [[H411|to these]] [[H376|men,]] [[H3588|for]] [[H935|they have come]] [[H6738|under the protection]] [[H6982|of my roof.]] ^1908

[[H5066|“Get out of the way!”]] [[H559|they replied.]] [[H559|And they declared,]] [[H259|“This one]] [[H935|came]] [[H1481|here as a foreigner,]] [[H8199|and he is already acting like a judge!]] [[H6258|Now]] [[H7489|we will treat you worse]] [[H1992|than them.”]] [[H6484|And they pressed]] [[H3876|in on Lot]] [[H5066|and moved in]] [[H7665|to break down]] [[H1817|the door.]] ^1909

[[H376|But the men]] ⟨inside⟩ [[H7971|reached out,]] [[H935|pulled]] [[H3876|Lot]] [[H1004|into the house]] [[H413|with them,]] [[H5462|and shut]] [[H1817|the door.]] ^1910

[[H853|And]] [[H5221|they struck]] [[H5575|with blindness]] [[H376|the men]] [[H6607|at the entrance,]] [[H6996|both young]] [[H5704|and]] [[H1419|old,]] [[H3811|so that they were unable]] [[H4672|to find]] [[H6607|the door.]] ^1911

[[H376|Then the men]] ⟨two⟩ [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H3876|Lot,]] [[H4310|“Do you have anyone]] [[H5750|else]] [[H6311|here—]] [[H2860|a son-in-law,]] [[H1121|your sons]] [[H1323|or daughters,]] [[H3605|or anyone]] [[H5892|else in the city]] [[H834|who belongs to you?]] [[H3318|Get them out]] [[H4480|of]] [[H4725|here,]] ^1912

[[H3588|because]] [[H587|we]] [[H7843|are about to destroy]] [[H2088|this]] [[H4725|place.]] [[H3588|For]] [[H6818|the outcry]] [[H854|to]] [[H3068|the LORD]] ⟨against its people⟩ [[H1431|is so great]] [[H3068|that]] ⟨He⟩ [[H7971|has sent]] [[H7843|us to destroy it.”]] ^1913

[[H3876|So Lot]] [[H3318|went out]] [[H1696|and spoke]] [[H413|to]] [[H2860|the sons-in-law]] [[H3947|who were pledged in marriage to]] [[H1323|his daughters.]] [[H6965|“Get up,”]] [[H559|he said.]] [[H3318|“Get out]] [[H4480|of]] [[H2088|this]] [[H4725|place,]] [[H3588|for]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H7843|is about to destroy]] [[H5892|the city!”]] [[H2860|But his sons-in-law]] [[H5869|thought]] [[H1961|he was]] [[H6711|joking.]] ^1914

[[H3644|At]] [[H7837|daybreak]] [[H4397|the angels]] [[H213|hurried]] [[H3876|Lot along,]] [[H559|saying,]] [[H6965|“Get up!]] [[H3947|Take]] [[H802|your wife]] [[H8147|and your two]] [[H1323|daughters]] [[H4672|who are here,]] [[H6435|or]] [[H5595|you will be swept away]] [[H5771|in the punishment]] [[H5892|of the city.”]] ^1915

[[H4102|But when hesitated,]] ⟨Lot⟩ [[H376|the men]] [[H2388|grabbed]] [[H3027|his hand]] [[H3027|and the hands]] [[H802|of his wife]] [[H3027|and]] [[H8147|his two]] [[H1323|daughters.]] [[H3318|And they led them]] [[H3240|safely]] [[H2351|out of]] [[H5892|the city,]] [[H3068|because of the LORD’s]] [[H2551|compassion]] [[H5921|for them.]] ^1916

[[H3318|As soon as the men had brought]] [[H2351|them out,]] [[H559|one of them said,]] [[H4422|“Run]] [[H5921|for]] [[H5315|your lives!]] [[H408|Do not]] [[H5027|look]] [[H310|back,]] [[H408|and do not]] [[H5975|stop]] [[H3605|anywhere]] [[H3603|on the plain!]] [[H4422|Flee]] [[H2022|to the mountains,]] [[H6435|or]] [[H5595|you will be swept away!”]] ^1917

[[H3876|But Lot]] [[H559|replied,]] [[H408|“No,]] [[H136|my lords,]] [[H4994|please!]] ^1918

[[H5650|Your servant]] [[H2009|has indeed]] [[H4672|found]] [[H2580|favor]] [[H5869|in your sight,]] [[H6213|and you have shown]] [[H1431|me great]] [[H2617|kindness]] [[H2421|by sparing]] [[H5315|my life.]] [[H595|But I]] [[H3808|cannot]] [[H4422|run]] [[H2022|to the mountains;]] [[H7451|the disaster]] [[H1692|will overtake me,]] [[H4191|and I will die.]] ^1919

[[H2009|Look,]] [[H2063|this]] [[H5892|town]] ⟨is⟩ [[H7138|near]] [[H5127|enough for me flee to it,]] [[H1931|and it]] [[H4705|is a small place.]] [[H4994|Please]] [[H4422|let me flee]] [[H8033|there—]] [[H1931|is it]] [[H3808|not]] [[H4705|a small place?]] [[H5315|Then my life]] [[H2421|will be saved.”]] ^1920

[[H2009|“Very well,”]] [[H559|he answered,]] [[H5375|“I will grant this request]] [[H1571|as well,]] [[H1115|and will not]] [[H2015|demolish]] [[H5892|the town]] [[H1696|you indicate.]] ^1921

[[H4116|Hurry!]] [[H4422|Run]] [[H8033|there quickly,]] [[H3588|for]] [[H3808|I cannot]] [[H6213|do]] [[H1697|anything]] [[H5704|until]] [[H935|you reach]] [[H8033|it.”]] [[H5921|That is why]] [[H5892|the town]] [[H7121|was called]] [[H6820|Zoar.]] ^1922

[[H8121|When the sun]] [[H3318|had risen]] [[H5921|over]] [[H776|the land,]] [[H3876|Lot]] [[H935|had reached]] [[H6820|Zoar.]] ^1923

[[H3068|Then the LORD]] [[H4305|rained down]] [[H1614|brimstone]] [[H784|and fire]] [[H5921|on]] [[H5467|Sodom]] [[H6017|and Gomorrah—]] [[H3068|from the LORD]] [[H4480|out of]] [[H8064|the heavens.]] ^1924

[[H2015|Thus He destroyed]] [[H411|these]] [[H5892|cities]] [[H3605|and the entire]] [[H3603|plain,]] [[H853|including]] [[H3605|all]] [[H3427|the inhabitants]] [[H5892|of the cities]] [[H6780|and everything that grew]] [[H127|on the ground.]] ^1925

[[H802|But wife]] ⟨Lot’s⟩ [[H5027|looked]] [[H310|back,]] [[H1961|and she became]] [[H5333|a pillar]] [[H4417|of salt.]] ^1926

[[H1242|Early the next morning,]] [[H85|Abraham]] [[H7925|got up]] [[H413|and returned to]] [[H4725|the place]] [[H834|where]] [[H5975|he had stood]] [[H6440|before]] [[H3068|the LORD.]] ^1927

[[H8259|He looked]] [[H5921|down]] [[H6440|toward]] [[H5467|Sodom]] [[H6017|and Gomorrah]] [[H3605|and all]] [[H776|the land]] [[H3603|of the plain,]] [[H7200|and he saw]] [[H7008|the smoke]] [[H5927|rising]] [[H776|from the land]] [[H7008|like smoke]] [[H3536|from a furnace.]] ^1928

[[H1961|So]] [[H430|when God]] [[H7843|destroyed]] [[H5892|the cities]] [[H3603|of the plain,]] [[H430|He]] [[H2142|remembered]] [[H85|Abraham,]] [[H7971|and He brought]] [[H3876|Lot]] [[H8432|out of the]] [[H2018|catastrophe]] [[H2015|that destroyed]] [[H5892|the cities]] [[H834|where]] ⟨he⟩ [[H3876|]] [[H3427|had lived.]] ^1929

[[H3876|Lot]] [[H5973|and]] [[H8147|his two]] [[H1323|daughters]] [[H5927|left]] [[H6820|Zoar]] [[H3427|and settled]] [[H2022|in the mountains—]] [[H3588|for]] [[H3372|he was afraid]] [[H3427|to stay]] [[H6820|in Zoar—]] [[H1931|where]] ⟨they⟩ [[H3427|lived]] [[H4631|in a cave.]] ^1930

[[H1067|One day the older]] ⟨daughter⟩ [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H6810|the younger,]] [[H1|“Our father]] [[H2204|is old,]] [[H369|and there is no]] [[H376|man]] [[H776|in the land]] [[H935|to sleep with]] [[H5921|us,]] [[H1870|as is the custom]] [[H3605|over all]] [[H776|the earth.]] ^1931

[[H1980|Come,]] [[H1|let us get our father]] [[H8248|drunk]] [[H3196|with wine,]] [[H7901|so that we can sleep]] [[H5973|with]] [[H2421|him and preserve]] ⟨his⟩ [[H1|]] [[H2233|line.”]] ^1932

[[H1931|So that]] [[H3915|night]] [[H1|they got their father]] [[H8248|drunk]] [[H3196|with wine,]] [[H1067|and the firstborn]] [[H935|came]] [[H7901|and slept with]] [[H1|her father;]] [[H3808|he was not]] [[H3045|aware]] [[H7901|when she lay down]] [[H6965|or when she got up.]] ^1933

[[H4283|The next day]] [[H1067|the older]] ⟨daughter⟩ [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H6810|the younger,]] [[H2005|“Look,]] [[H7901|I slept with]] [[H1|my father]] [[H570|last night.]] [[H8248|Let us get him drunk]] [[H3196|with wine]] [[H1571|again]] [[H3915|tonight,]] [[H935|so you can go]] [[H7901|sleep]] [[H5973|with him,]] [[H2421|and we can preserve]] [[H1|our father’s]] [[H2233|line.”]] ^1934

[[H1571|So again]] [[H1931|that]] [[H3915|night]] [[H1|they got their father]] [[H8248|drunk]] [[H3196|with wine,]] [[H6810|and the younger]] ⟨daughter⟩ [[H6965|went]] [[H7901|and slept]] [[H5973|with him;]] [[H3808|he was not]] [[H3045|aware]] [[H7901|when she lay down]] [[H6965|or when she got up.]] ^1935

[[H8147|Thus both]] [[H3876|of Lot’s]] [[H1323|daughters]] [[H2029|became pregnant]] [[H1|by their father.]] ^1936

[[H1067|The older]] ⟨daughter⟩ [[H3205|gave birth to]] [[H1121|a son]] [[H7121|and named]] [[H4124|him Moab.]] [[H1931|He]] [[H1|is the father]] [[H4124|of the Moabites]] [[H5704|of]] [[H3117|today.]] ^1937

[[H6810|The younger]] ⟨daughter⟩ [[H1571|also]] [[H3205|gave birth to]] [[H1121|a son,]] [[H7121|and she named]] [[H8034|him]] [[H1151|Ben-ammi.]] [[H1931|He]] [[H1|is the father]] [[H1121|of the Ammonites]] [[H5704|of]] [[H3117|today.]] ^1938

[[H85|Now Abraham]] [[H5265|journeyed]] [[H8033|from there]] [[H776|to the region]] [[H5045|of the Negev]] [[H3427|and settled]] [[H996|between]] [[H6946|Kadesh]] [[H7793|and Shur.]] [[H1481|While he was staying]] [[H1642|in Gerar,]] ^2001

[[H85|Abraham]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|of]] [[H802|his wife]] [[H8283|Sarah,]] [[H1931|“She]] [[H269|is my sister.”]] [[H40|So Abimelech]] [[H4428|king]] [[H1642|of Gerar]] [[H8283|had Sarah]] [[H7971|brought]] [[H3947|to him.]] ^2002

[[H3915|One night, however,]] [[H430|God]] [[H935|came]] [[H413|to]] [[H40|Abimelech]] [[H2472|in a dream]] [[H559|and told him,]] [[H4191|“You are as good as dead]] [[H5921|because of]] [[H802|the woman]] [[H3947|you have taken,]] [[H1931|for she]] [[H1166|is a married]] [[H1167|woman.”]] ^2003

[[H40|Now Abimelech]] [[H3808|had not]] [[H7126|gone near her,]] [[H559|so he replied,]] [[H136|“Lord,]] [[H2026|would You destroy]] [[H1471|a nation]] [[H1571|even though]] [[H6662|it is innocent?]] ^2004

[[H3808|Didn’t]] ⟨Abraham⟩ [[H1931|]] [[H559|tell me,]] [[H1931|‘She]] [[H269|is my sister’?]] [[H1931|And she]] [[H1931|herself]] [[H559|said,]] [[H1931|‘He]] [[H251|is my brother.’]] [[H6213|I have done]] [[H2063|this]] [[H8537|with a clear]] [[H3824|conscience]] [[H5356|and clean]] [[H3709|hands.”]] ^2005

[[H430|Then God]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] ⟨Abimelech⟩ [[H2472|in the dream,]] [[H1571|“Yes,]] [[H595|I]] [[H3045|know]] [[H3588|that]] [[H6213|you did]] [[H2063|this]] [[H8537|with a clear]] [[H3824|conscience,]] [[H595|and so I]] [[H1571|have also]] [[H2820|kept]] [[H853|you]] [[H2398|from sinning against Me.]] [[H5921|That is why]] [[H3808|I did not]] [[H5414|let]] [[H5060|you touch]] [[H413|her.]] ^2006

[[H6258|Now]] [[H7725|return]] [[H376|the man’s]] [[H802|wife,]] [[H3588|for]] [[H1931|he]] [[H5030|is a prophet;]] [[H6419|he will pray]] [[H1157|for you]] [[H2421|and you will live.]] [[H518|But if]] [[H369|you do not]] [[H7725|restore her,]] [[H3045|be aware]] [[H3588|that]] [[H4191|you will surely]] [[H4191|die—]] [[H859|you]] [[H3605|and all]] [[H834|who belong]] ^2007

[[H1242|Early the next morning]] [[H40|Abimelech]] [[H7925|got up]] [[H7121|and summoned]] [[H3605|all]] [[H5650|his servants;]] [[H1696|and when he described to them]] [[H3605|all]] [[H428|that]] [[H1697|had happened,]] [[H376|the men]] [[H3372|were terrified.]] ^2008

[[H40|Then Abimelech]] [[H7121|called]] [[H85|Abraham]] [[H559|and asked,]] [[H4100|“What]] [[H6213|have you done to us?]] [[H4100|How]] [[H2398|have I sinned]] [[H3588|against you,  that]] [[H935|you have brought]] [[H1419|such tremendous]] [[H2401|guilt]] [[H5921|upon me]] [[H5921|and]] [[H4467|my kingdom?]] [[H6213|You have done]] [[H4639|things]] [[H5978|to me]] [[H834|that]] [[H3808|should not]] [[H6213|be done.]] ^2009

[[H40|Abimelech]] [[H559|also asked]] [[H85|Abraham,]] [[H4100|“What]] [[H7200|prompted]] [[H6213|you to do]] [[H2088|such]] [[H1697|a thing?”]] ^2010

[[H85|Abraham]] [[H559|replied,]] [[H559|“I thought to myself,]] [[H7535|‘Surely]] [[H369|there is no]] [[H3374|fear]] [[H430|of God]] [[H2088|in this]] [[H4725|place.]] [[H2026|They will kill me]] [[H5921|on account of]] [[H802|my wife.’]] ^2011

[[H1571|Besides,]] [[H1931|she]] [[H546|really]] [[H269|is my sister,]] [[H1323|the daughter]] [[H1|of my father—]] [[H389|though]] [[H3808|not]] [[H1323|the daughter]] [[H517|of my mother—]] [[H1961|and she became]] [[H802|my wife.]] ^2012

[[H834|So when]] [[H430|God]] [[H8582|had me journey]] [[H1|from my father’s]] [[H1004|house,]] [[H559|I said]] [[H2088|to,  ‘This is how]] ⟨Sarah⟩ [[H6213|you can show]] [[H2617|your loyalty]] [[H5978|to me:]] [[H3605|Wherever]] [[H935|we go,]] [[H559|say of me,]] [[H1931|“He is]] [[H251|my brother.”’”]] ^2013

[[H40|So Abimelech]] [[H3947|brought]] [[H6629|sheep]] [[H1241|and cattle,]] [[H5650|menservants]] [[H8198|and maidservants,]] [[H5414|and he gave]] [[H85|them to Abraham]] [[H7725|and restored]] [[H802|his wife]] [[H8283|Sarah to him.]] ^2014

[[H40|And Abimelech]] [[H559|said,]] [[H2009|“Look,]] [[H776|my land]] [[H6440|is before you.]] [[H3427|Settle wherever you please.”]] ^2015

[[H559|And he said]] [[H8283|to Sarah,]] [[H2009|“See,]] [[H5414|I am giving]] [[H251|your brother]] [[H505|a thousand]] ⟨pieces⟩ [[H3701|of silver.]] [[H1931|It]] ⟨is⟩ [[H3682|your  vindication]] [[H3605|before all]] [[H834|who]] [[H854|are with you;]] [[H3605|you are completely]] [[H3198|cleared.”]] ^2016

[[H85|Then Abraham]] [[H6419|prayed]] [[H413|to]] [[H430|God,]] [[H430|and God]] [[H7495|healed]] [[H40|Abimelech]] [[H802|and his wife]] [[H519|and his maidservants,]] [[H3205|so that they could again bear children—]] ^2017

[[H3588|for]] [[H5921|on]] [[H1697|account]] [[H85|of Abraham’s]] [[H802|wife]] [[H8283|Sarah,]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H6113|had completely closed]] [[H3605|all]] [[H7358|the wombs]] [[H40|in Abimelech’s]] [[H1004|household.]] ^2018

[[H3068|Now the LORD]] [[H6485|attended]] [[H8283|to Sarah]] [[H834|as]] [[H559|He had said,]] [[H3068|and the LORD]] [[H6213|did]] [[H8283|for Sarah]] [[H834|what]] [[H1696|He had promised.]] ^2101

[[H8283|So Sarah]] [[H2029|conceived]] [[H3205|and bore]] [[H1121|a son]] [[H85|to Abraham]] [[H2208|in his old age,]] [[H4150|at the very time]] [[H430|God]] [[H1696|had promised him.]] ^2102

[[H85|And Abraham]] [[H7121|gave]] [[H8034|the name]] [[H3327|Isaac]] [[H1121|to the son]] [[H8283|Sarah]] [[H3205|bore]] ^2103

[[H1121|When his son]] [[H3327|Isaac]] [[H8083|was eight]] [[H3117|days old,]] [[H85|Abraham]] [[H4135|circumcised him,]] [[H834|as]] [[H430|God]] [[H6680|had commanded him.]] ^2104

[[H85|Abraham]] [[H3967|was a hundred]] [[H1121|years old]] [[H1121|when his son]] [[H3327|Isaac]] [[H3205|was born]] ^2105

[[H8283|Then Sarah]] [[H559|said,]] [[H430|“God]] [[H6213|has made]] [[H6712|me  laugh,]] [[H3605|and everyone]] [[H8085|who hears of this]] [[H6711|will laugh with me.”]] ^2106

[[H559|She added,]] [[H4310|“Who]] [[H4448|would have told]] [[H85|Abraham]] [[H8283|that Sarah]] [[H3243|would nurse]] [[H1121|children?]] [[H3588|Yet]] [[H3205|I have borne him]] [[H1121|a son]] [[H2208|in his old age.”]] ^2107

[[H3206|So the child]] [[H1431|grew]] [[H1580|and was weaned,]] [[H85|and Abraham]] [[H6213|held]] [[H1419|a great]] [[H4960|feast]] [[H3117|on the day]] [[H3327|Isaac]] [[H1580|was weaned.]] ^2108

[[H8283|But Sarah]] [[H7200|saw that]] [[H1121|the son]] [[H834|whom]] [[H1904|Hagar]] [[H4713|the Egyptian]] [[H3205|had borne]] [[H85|to Abraham]] [[H6711|was mocking]] ⟨her son⟩, ^2109

[[H559|and she said]] [[H85|to Abraham,]] [[H1644|“Expel]] [[H2063|the]] [[H519|slave woman]] [[H1121|and her son,]] [[H3588|for]] [[H519|the slave woman’s]] [[H1121|son]] [[H3808|will never]] [[H3423|share in the inheritance]] [[H5973|with]] [[H1121|my son]] [[H3327|Isaac!”]] ^2110

[[H1697|Now this matter]] [[H7489|distressed]] [[H85|Abraham]] [[H3966|greatly]] [[H182|because it concerned]] [[H1121|his son]] ⟨Ishmael⟩. ^2111

[[H430|But God]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H85|Abraham,]] [[H408|“Do not]] [[H7489|be distressed]] [[H5921|about]] [[H5288|the boy]] [[H519|and your maidservant.]] [[H8085|Listen to]] [[H3605|everything]] [[H834|that]] [[H8283|Sarah]] [[H559|tells]] [[H413|you,]] [[H3588|for]] [[H3327|through Isaac]] [[H2233|your offspring]] [[H7121|will be reckoned.]] ^2112

[[H1571|But I will also]] [[H7760|make]] [[H1471|a nation]] [[H519|of the slave woman’s]] [[H1121|son,]] [[H3588|because]] [[H1931|he]] [[H2233|is your offspring.”]] ^2113

[[H1242|Early in the morning,]] [[H85|Abraham]] [[H7925|got up,]] [[H3947|took]] [[H3899|bread]] [[H2573|and a skin of water,]] [[H7760|put]] [[H5921|them on]] [[H1904|Hagar’s]] [[H7926|shoulders,]] [[H3206|and sent her away with the boy.]] [[H1980|She left]] [[H8582|and wandered]] [[H4057|in the wilderness]] [[H884|of  Beersheba.]] ^2114

[[H4325|When the water]] [[H4480|in]] [[H2573|the skin]] [[H3615|was gone,]] [[H7993|she left]] [[H3206|the boy]] [[H8478|under]] [[H259|one]] [[H7880|of the bushes.]] ^2115

[[H1980|Then she went off]] [[H3427|and sat down]] [[H5048|nearby,]] [[H2909|about a bowshot]] [[H7368|away,]] [[H3588|for]] [[H559|she said,]] [[H408|“I cannot]] [[H7200|bear to watch]] [[H3206|the boy]] [[H4194|die!”]] [[H3427|And as she sat]] [[H5048|nearby,]] [[H5375|she lifted up]] [[H6963|her voice]] [[H1058|and wept.]] ^2116

[[H430|Then God]] [[H8085|heard]] [[H6963|the voice]] [[H5288|of the boy,]] [[H4397|and the angel]] [[H430|of God]] [[H7121|called]] [[H413|to]] [[H1904|Hagar]] [[H4480|from]] [[H8064|heaven,]] [[H4100|“What is wrong,]] [[H1904|Hagar?]] [[H408|Do not]] [[H3372|be afraid,]] [[H3588|for]] [[H430|God]] [[H8085|has heard]] [[H6963|the voice]] [[H5288|of the boy]] [[H834|where]] [[H1931|he]] [[H8033|lies.]] ^2117

[[H6965|Arise,]] [[H5375|lift up]] [[H5288|the boy]] [[H2388|and take him]] [[H3027|by the hand,]] [[H3588|for]] [[H7760|I will make him]] [[H1419|into a great]] [[H1471|nation.”]] ^2118

[[H430|Then God]] [[H6491|opened]] [[H5869|her eyes,]] [[H7200|and she saw]] [[H875|a well]] [[H4325|of water.]] [[H1980|So she went]] [[H4390|and filled]] [[H2573|the skin with water]] [[H5288|and gave the boy]] [[H8248|a drink.]] ^2119

[[H430|And God]] [[H1961|was]] [[H854|with]] [[H5288|the boy,]] [[H1431|and he grew up]] [[H3427|and settled]] [[H4057|in the wilderness]] [[H1961|and became]] [[H7235|a great]] [[H7199|archer.]] ^2120

[[H3427|And while he was dwelling]] [[H4057|in the wilderness]] [[H6290|of Paran,]] [[H517|his mother]] [[H3947|got]] [[H802|a wife]] [[H776|for him  from the land]] [[H4714|of Egypt.]] ^2121

[[H1931|At that]] [[H6256|time]] [[H40|Abimelech]] [[H6369|and Phicol]] [[H8269|the commander]] [[H6635|of his army]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H85|Abraham,]] [[H430|“God]] [[H5973|is with you]] [[H3605|in all]] [[H834|that]] [[H859|you]] [[H6213|do.]] ^2122

[[H6258|Now, therefore,]] [[H7650|swear]] [[H2008|to me  here]] [[H430|before God]] [[H518|that you will not]] [[H8266|deal falsely]] [[H5209|with me  or my children]] [[H5220|or descendants.]] [[H6213|Show]] [[H5978|to me]] [[H5973|and]] [[H776|to the country]] [[H834|in which]] [[H1481|you reside]] [[H2617|the same kindness]] [[H834|that]] [[H6213|I have shown]] [[H5973|to you.”]] ^2123

[[H85|And Abraham]] [[H559|replied,]] [[H595|“I]] [[H7650|swear it.”]] ^2124

[[H85|But when Abraham]] [[H3198|complained]] [[H40|to Abimelech]] [[H5921|about]] [[H875|a well]] [[H834|that]] [[H40|Abimelech’s]] [[H5650|servants]] [[H1497|had seized,]] ^2125

[[H40|Abimelech]] [[H559|replied,]] [[H3808|“I do not]] [[H3045|know]] [[H4310|who]] [[H6213|has done]] [[H2088|this.]] [[H859|You]] [[H3808|did not]] [[H5046|tell]] [[H595|me,  so I]] [[H3808|have not]] [[H8085|heard]] [[H1115|about it until today.”]] ^2126

[[H85|So Abraham]] [[H3947|brought]] [[H6629|sheep]] [[H1241|and cattle]] [[H5414|and gave]] [[H40|them to Abimelech,]] [[H8147|and the two men]] [[H3772|made]] [[H1285|a covenant.]] ^2127

[[H85|Abraham]] [[H5324|separated]] [[H7651|seven]] [[H3535|ewe lambs]] [[H6629|from the flock,]] ^2128

[[H40|and Abimelech]] [[H559|asked]] ⟨him⟩ [[H85|,]] [[H4100|“Why]] [[H5324|have you set apart]] [[H428|these]] [[H7651|seven]] [[H3535|ewe lambs?”]] ^2129

[[H559|He replied,]] [[H3947|“You are to accept]] [[H7651|the seven]] [[H3535|ewe lambs]] [[H3027|from my hand]] [[H5713|as my witness]] [[H3588|that]] [[H2658|I dug]] [[H2063|this]] [[H875|well.”]] ^2130

[[H5921|So]] [[H1931|that]] [[H4725|place]] [[H7121|was called]] [[H884|Beersheba,]] [[H3588|because]] [[H8033|it was there]] [[H8147|that the two]] [[H7650|of them swore an oath.]] ^2131

[[H3772|After they had made]] [[H1285|the covenant]] [[H884|at Beersheba,]] [[H40|Abimelech]] [[H6369|and Phicol]] [[H8269|the commander]] [[H6635|of his army]] [[H6965|got up]] [[H7725|and returned]] [[H413|to]] [[H776|the land]] [[H6430|of the Philistines.]] ^2132

[[H5193|And planted]] ⟨Abraham⟩ [[H815|a tamarisk tree]] [[H884|in Beersheba,]] [[H8033|and there]] [[H7121|he called]] [[H8034|upon the name]] [[H3068|of the LORD,]] [[H5769|the Eternal]] [[H410|God.]] ^2133

[[H85|And Abraham]] [[H1481|resided]] [[H776|in the land]] [[H6430|of the Philistines]] [[H7227|for a long]] [[H3117|time.]] ^2134

[[H310|Some time later]] [[H430|God]] [[H5254|tested]] [[H85|Abraham]] [[H559|and said]] [[H413|to him,]] [[H85|“Abraham!”]] [[H2009|“Here I am,”]] [[H559|he answered.]] ^2201

[[H3947|“Take]] [[H1121|your son,”]] ⟨God⟩ [[H559|said,]] [[H3173|“your only]] [[H3327|son Isaac,]] [[H834|whom]] [[H157|you love,]] [[H1980|and go]] [[H413|to]] [[H776|the land]] [[H4179|of Moriah.]] [[H5927|Offer him]] [[H8033|there]] [[H5930|as a burnt offering]] [[H5921|on]] [[H259|one]] [[H2022|of the mountains]] [[H559|I will show]] [[H413|you.”]] ^2202

[[H85|So Abraham]] [[H7925|got up early]] [[H1242|the next morning,]] [[H2280|saddled]] [[H2543|his donkey,]] [[H3947|and took]] [[H854|along]] [[H8147|two]] [[H5288|of his servants]] [[H1121|and his son]] [[H3327|Isaac.]] [[H1234|He split]] [[H6086|wood]] [[H5930|for a burnt offering]] [[H6965|and set out for]] [[H4725|the place]] [[H430|God]] [[H559|had designated.]] ^2203

[[H7992|On the third]] [[H3117|day]] [[H85|Abraham]] [[H5375|looked up]] [[H7200|and saw]] [[H4725|the place]] [[H7350|in the distance.]] ^2204

[[H3427|“Stay]] [[H6311|here]] [[H5973|with]] [[H2543|the donkey,”]] [[H85|Abraham]] [[H559|told]] [[H5288|his servants.]] [[H5288|“The boy]] [[H589|and I]] [[H1980|will go]] [[H5704|over]] [[H3541|there]] [[H7812|to worship,]] [[H7725|and then we will return]] [[H413|to you.”]] ^2205

[[H85|Abraham]] [[H3947|took]] [[H6086|the wood]] [[H5930|for the burnt offering]] [[H7760|and placed]] [[H5921|it on]] [[H1121|his son]] [[H3327|Isaac.]] [[H3947|He himself carried]] [[H784|the fire]] [[H3979|and the sacrificial knife,]] [[H8147|and the two]] [[H1980|of them walked on]] [[H3162|together.]] ^2206

[[H3327|Then Isaac]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H1|his father]] [[H85|Abraham,]] [[H1|“My father!”]] [[H2009|“Here I am,]] [[H1121|my son,”]] [[H559|he replied.]] [[H784|“The fire]] [[H6086|and the wood]] [[H2009|are here,”]] [[H559|said Isaac,]] [[H346|“but where]] [[H7716|is the lamb]] [[H5930|for the burnt offering?”]] ^2207

[[H85|Abraham]] [[H559|answered,]] [[H430|“God]] [[H7200|Himself  will provide]] [[H7716|the lamb]] [[H5930|for the burnt offering,]] [[H1121|my son.”]] [[H8147|And the two]] [[H1980|walked on]] [[H3162|together.]] ^2208

[[H935|When they arrived]] [[H413|at]] [[H4725|the place]] [[H430|God]] [[H559|had designated,]] [[H85|Abraham]] [[H1129|built]] [[H4196|the altar]] [[H8033|there]] [[H6186|and arranged]] [[H6086|the wood.]] [[H6123|He bound]] [[H1121|his son]] [[H3327|Isaac]] [[H7760|and placed]] [[H5921|him on]] [[H4196|the altar,]] [[H4605|atop]] [[H6086|the wood.]] ^2209

[[H85|Then Abraham]] [[H7971|reached out]] [[H3027|his hand]] [[H3947|and took]] [[H3979|the knife]] [[H7819|to slaughter]] [[H1121|his son.]] ^2210

[[H4397|Just then, the Angel]] [[H3068|of the LORD]] [[H7121|called out]] [[H413|to]] [[H4480|him from]] [[H8064|heaven,]] [[H85|“Abraham,]] [[H85|Abraham!”]] [[H2009|“Here I am,”]] [[H559|he replied.]] ^2211

[[H6085|Ephron]] [[H6030|answered]] [[H85|Abraham,]] ^2314

[[H8085|“Listen to me,]] [[H113|my lord.]] [[H776|The land]] ⟨is worth⟩ [[H702|four]] [[H3967|hundred]] [[H8255|shekels]] [[H3701|of silver,]] [[H4100|but what]] [[H1931|is that]] [[H996|between you and me?]] [[H6912|Bury]] [[H4191|your dead.”]] ^2315

[[H85|Abraham]] [[H8085|agreed]] [[H413|to]] [[H6085|Ephron’s terms]] [[H85|and]] [[H8254|weighed out]] ⟨for him⟩ [[H6085|]] [[H3701|the price]] [[H1696|he had named]] [[H241|in the hearing]] [[H1121|of the Hittites:]] [[H702|four]] [[H3967|hundred]] [[H8255|shekels]] [[H3701|of silver,]] [[H5674|according to the standard]] [[H5503|of the merchants.]] ^2316

[[H6085|So Ephron’s]] [[H7704|field]] [[H4375|at Machpelah]] [[H6440|near]] [[H4471|Mamre,]] [[H4631|the cave]] [[H834|that was]] [[H3605|in it,  and all]] [[H6086|the trees]] [[H3605|within]] [[H1366|the boundaries]] [[H7704|of the field,]] [[H6965|were deeded over]] ^2317

[[H85|to Abraham’s]] [[H4736|possession]] [[H5869|in the presence]] [[H3605|of all]] [[H1121|the Hittites]] [[H935|who had come]] [[H8179|to the gate]] [[H5892|of his city.]] ^2318

[[H310|After]] [[H3651|this,]] [[H85|Abraham]] [[H6912|buried]] [[H802|his wife]] [[H8283|Sarah]] [[H413|in]] [[H4631|the cave]] [[H7704|of the field]] [[H4375|at Machpelah]] [[H5921|near]] [[H4471|Mamre]] [[H1931|(that is,]] [[H2275|Hebron)]] [[H776|in the land]] [[H3667|of Canaan.]] ^2319

[[H7704|So the field]] [[H834|and its]] [[H4631|cave]] [[H6965|were deeded]] [[H1121|by the Hittites]] [[H85|to Abraham]] [[H6913|as a burial]] [[H272|site.]] ^2320

[[H85|By now Abraham]] [[H2204|was old]] [[H935|and well along]] [[H3117|in years,]] [[H3068|and the LORD]] [[H1288|had blessed]] [[H85|him]] [[H3605|in every way.]] ^2401

[[H85|So Abraham]] [[H559|instructed]] [[H2205|the chief]] [[H5650|servant]] [[H1004|of his household,]] [[H4910|who managed]] [[H3605|all he owned,]] [[H7760|“Place]] [[H3027|your hand]] [[H8478|under]] [[H3409|my thigh,]] ^2402

[[H7650|and I will have you swear]] [[H3068|by the LORD,]] [[H430|the God]] [[H8064|of heaven]] [[H430|and the God]] [[H776|of earth,]] [[H834|that]] [[H3808|you will not]] [[H3947|take]] [[H802|a wife]] [[H1121|for my son]] [[H1323|from the daughters]] [[H3669|of the Canaanites]] [[H7130|among]] [[H834|whom]] [[H595|I]] [[H3427|am dwelling,]] ^2403

[[H3588|but]] [[H1980|will go]] [[H413|to]] [[H776|my country]] [[H413|and]] [[H4138|my kindred]] [[H3947|to take]] [[H802|a wife]] [[H1121|for my son]] [[H3327|Isaac.”]] ^2404

[[H5650|The servant]] [[H559|asked]] [[H413|him,]] [[H194|“What if]] [[H802|the woman]] [[H3808|is unwilling]] [[H1980|to follow]] [[H413|me to]] [[H2063|this]] [[H776|land?]] [[H7725|Shall I then take your son back]] [[H413|to]] [[H776|the land]] [[H8033|from]] [[H834|which]] [[H3318|you came?”]] ^2405

[[H85|Abraham]] [[H559|replied,]] [[H8104|“Make sure]] [[H6435|that you do not]] [[H1121|take my son]] [[H7725|back]] [[H8033|there.]] ^2406

[[H3068|The LORD,]] [[H430|the God]] [[H8064|of heaven,]] [[H834|who]] [[H3947|brought me]] [[H1|from my father’s]] [[H1004|house]] [[H4138|and my native]] [[H776|land,]] [[H834|who]] [[H1696|spoke]] [[H834|to me  and]] [[H7650|promised me on oath,]] [[H559|saying,]] [[H2233|‘To your offspring]] [[H5414|I will give]] [[H2063|this]] [[H776|land’—]] [[H1931|He]] [[H7971|will send]] [[H4397|His angel]] [[H6440|before you]] [[H3947|so that you can take]] [[H802|a wife]] [[H1121|for my son]] [[H8033|from there.]] ^2407

[[H518|And if]] [[H802|the woman]] [[H3808|is unwilling]] [[H1980|to follow]] [[H310|you,]] [[H5352|then you are released]] [[H2063|from this]] [[H7621|oath of mine.]] [[H7535|Only]] [[H3808|do not]] [[H7725|take]] [[H1121|my son]] [[H8033|back there.”]] ^2408

[[H5650|So the servant]] [[H7760|placed]] [[H3027|his hand]] [[H8478|under]] [[H113|his master]] [[H85|Abraham’s]] [[H3409|thigh]] [[H7650|and swore an oath]] [[H5921|to him  concerning]] [[H2088|this]] [[H1697|matter.]] ^2409

[[H5650|Then the servant]] [[H3947|took]] [[H6235|ten]] [[H113|of his master’s]] [[H1581|camels]] [[H1980|and departed]] [[H3605|with all manner]] [[H2898|of good things]] [[H113|from his master]] [[H3027|in hand.]] [[H6965|And he set out]] [[H413|for]] [[H5152|Nahor’s]] [[H5892|hometown]] [[H763|in Mesopotamia.]] ^2410

[[H6153|As evening approached,]] [[H1581|he made the camels]] [[H1288|kneel down]] [[H413|near]] [[H875|the well]] [[H2351|outside]] [[H5892|the town,]] [[H6256|at the time]] [[H3318|when the women went out]] [[H7579|to draw water.]] ^2411

[[H3068|“O LORD,]] [[H430|God]] [[H113|of my master]] [[H85|Abraham,”]] [[H559|he prayed,]] [[H4994|“please]] [[H7136|grant me success today,]] [[H6213|and show]] [[H2617|kindness]] [[H5973|to]] [[H113|my master]] [[H85|Abraham.]] ^2412

[[H2009|Here]] [[H595|I am,]] [[H5324|standing]] [[H5921|beside]] [[H5869|the spring,]] [[H1323|and the daughters]] [[H376|of the townspeople]] [[H3318|are coming out]] [[H7579|to draw]] [[H4325|water.]] ^2413

[[H1961|Now may it happen]] [[H5291|that the girl]] [[H413|to]] [[H834|whom]] [[H559|I say,]] [[H4994|‘Please]] [[H5186|let down]] [[H3537|your jar]] [[H8354|that I may drink,’]] [[H559|and who responds,]] [[H8354|‘Drink,]] [[H8248|and I will water]] [[H1581|your camels]] [[H1571|as well’—]] [[H3198|let her be the one You have appointed]] [[H5650|for Your servant]] [[H3327|Isaac.]] [[H3045|By this I will know]] [[H3588|that]] [[H6213|You have shown]] [[H2617|kindness]] [[H5973|to]] [[H113|my master.]] ^2414

[[H2962|Before]] [[H1931|he]] [[H3615|had finished]] [[H1696|praying,]] [[H7259|Rebekah]] [[H3318|came out]] [[H3537|with her jar]] [[H5921|on]] [[H7926|her shoulder.]] [[H834|She]] [[H3205|was]] [[H1328|the daughter of Bethuel]] [[H1121|son]] [[H4435|of Milcah,]] [[H802|the wife]] [[H85|of Abraham’s]] [[H251|brother]] [[H5152|Nahor.]] ^2415

[[H5291|Now the girl]] [[H3966|was very]] [[H2896|beautiful,]] [[H1330|a virgin]] [[H3045|who had not had relations]] [[H376|with any man.]] [[H3381|She went down]] [[H5869|to the spring,]] [[H4390|filled]] [[H3537|her jar,]] [[H5927|and came up again.]] ^2416

[[H5650|So the servant]] [[H7323|ran]] [[H7125|to meet her]] [[H559|and said,]] [[H4994|“Please]] [[H1572|let me have]] [[H4592|a little]] [[H4325|water]] [[H3537|from your jar.”]] ^2417

[[H8354|“Drink,]] [[H113|my lord,”]] [[H559|she replied,]] [[H4116|and she quickly]] [[H3381|lowered]] [[H3537|her jar]] [[H5921|to]] [[H3027|her hands]] [[H8248|and gave him a drink.]] ^2418

[[H3615|After she]] [[H8248|had given him a drink,]] [[H559|she said,]] [[H1571|“I will also]] [[H7579|draw water]] [[H1581|for your camels,]] [[H5704|until]] [[H3615|they have had enough]] [[H8354|to drink.”]] ^2419

[[H4116|And she quickly]] [[H6168|emptied]] [[H3537|her jar]] [[H413|into]] [[H8268|the trough]] [[H7323|and ran]] [[H5750|back]] [[H413|to]] [[H875|the well]] [[H7579|to draw water,]] [[H7579|until she had drawn water]] [[H3605|for all]] [[H1581|his camels.]] ^2420

[[H376|Meanwhile, the man]] [[H7583|watched her]] [[H2790|silently]] [[H3045|to see]] [[H518|whether]] [[H3808|or not]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H1870|had made his journey]] [[H6743|a success.]] ^2421

[[H1961|And]] [[H834|after]] [[H1581|the camels]] [[H3615|had finished]] [[H8354|drinking,]] ⟨he⟩ [[H376|]] [[H3947|took out]] [[H2091|a gold]] [[H5141|ring]] [[H4948|weighing]] [[H1235|a beka,]] [[H8147|and two]] [[H2091|gold]] [[H6781|bracelets]] [[H5921|for]] [[H3027|her wrists]] [[H4948|weighing]] [[H6235|ten]] ⟨shekels⟩. ^2422

[[H4310|“Whose]] [[H1323|daughter]] [[H859|are you?”]] [[H559|he asked.]] [[H4994|“Please]] [[H5046|tell me,]] [[H3426|is there]] [[H4725|room]] [[H1|in your father’s]] [[H1004|house]] [[H3885|for us to spend the night?”]] ^2423

[[H559|She replied,]] [[H595|“I]] [[H1323|am the daughter]] [[H1328|of Bethuel,]] [[H1121|the son]] [[H4435|that Milcah]] [[H3205|bore]] [[H5152|to Nahor.”]] ^2424

[[H559|Then she added,]] [[H5973|“We have]] [[H7227|plenty]] [[H8401|of straw]] [[H1571|and]] [[H4554|feed,]] [[H1571|as well as]] [[H4725|a place]] ⟨for you⟩ [[H3885|to spend the night.”]] ^2425

[[H376|Then the man]] [[H6915|bowed down]] [[H7812|and worshiped]] [[H3068|the LORD,]] ^2426

[[H559|saying,]] [[H1288|“Blessed]] ⟨be⟩ [[H3068|the LORD,]] [[H430|the God]] [[H113|of my master]] [[H85|Abraham,]] [[H834|who]] [[H3808|has not]] [[H5800|withheld]] [[H2617|His kindness]] [[H571|and faithfulness]] [[H5973|from]] [[H113|my master.]] [[H595|As for me,]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H5148|has led]] [[H1870|me on the journey]] [[H1004|to the house]] [[H113|of my master’s]] [[H251|kinsmen.]] ^2427

[[H5291|The girl]] [[H7323|ran]] [[H5046|and told]] [[H517|her mother’s]] [[H1004|household]] [[H428|about these]] [[H1697|things.]] ^2428

[[H7259|Now Rebekah]] [[H251|had a brother]] [[H8034|named]] [[H3837|Laban,]] [[H3837|and]] ⟨he⟩ [[H7323|rushed]] [[H2351|out]] [[H413|to]] [[H376|the man]] [[H413|at]] [[H5869|the spring.]] ^2429

[[H7200|As soon as he saw]] [[H5141|the ring,]] [[H853|and]] [[H6781|the bracelets]] [[H5921|on]] [[H269|his sister’s]] [[H3027|wrists,]] [[H8085|and heard]] [[H7259|Rebekah’s]] [[H1697|words,]] [[H376|“The man]] [[H1696|said]] [[H3541|this]] [[H413|to me,”]] [[H935|he went and found]] [[H376|the man]] [[H5975|standing]] [[H5921|by]] [[H1581|the camels]] [[H5921|near]] [[H5869|the spring.]] ^2430

[[H935|“Come,]] [[H1288|you who are blessed]] [[H3068|by the LORD,”]] [[H559|said Laban.]] [[H4100|“Why]] [[H5975|are you standing]] [[H2351|out here?]] [[H595|I]] [[H6437|have prepared]] [[H1004|the house]] [[H4725|and a place]] [[H1581|for the camels.”]] ^2431

[[H376|So the man]] [[H935|came]] [[H1004|to the house,]] [[H1581|and the camels]] [[H6605|were unloaded.]] [[H8401|Straw]] [[H4554|and feed]] [[H5414|were brought]] [[H1581|to the camels,]] [[H4325|and water]] [[H7364|to wash]] [[H7272|his feet]] [[H7272|and the feet]] [[H582|of his companions.]] ^2432

[[H3455|Then a meal was set]] [[H6440|before]] ⟨the man⟩, [[H559|but he said,]] [[H3808|“I will not]] [[H398|eat]] [[H5704|until]] [[H1696|I have told you]] [[H1697|what I came to say.”]] [[H559|So Laban said,]] [[H1696|“Please speak.”]] ^2433

[[H595|“I]] [[H85|am Abraham’s]] [[H5650|servant,”]] [[H559|he replied.]] ^2434

[[H3068|“The LORD]] [[H3966|has greatly]] [[H1288|blessed]] [[H113|my master,]] [[H1431|and he has become rich.]] [[H5414|He has given]] [[H6629|him  sheep]] [[H1241|and cattle,]] [[H3701|silver]] [[H2091|and gold,]] [[H5650|menservants]] [[H8198|and maidservants,]] [[H1581|camels]] [[H2543|and donkeys.]] ^2435

[[H113|My master’s]] [[H802|wife]] [[H8283|Sarah]] [[H3205|has borne]] ⟨him⟩ [[H113|]] [[H1121|a son]] [[H310|in]] [[H2209|her old age,]] [[H5414|and has given]] ⟨my master⟩ [[H3605|him  everything he owns.]] ^2436

[[H113|My master]] [[H7650|made me swear an oath]] [[H559|and said,]] [[H3808|‘You shall not]] [[H3947|take]] [[H802|a wife]] [[H1121|for my son]] [[H1323|from the daughters]] [[H3669|of the Canaanites]] [[H776|in whose land]] [[H595|I]] [[H3427|dwell,]] ^2437

[[H518|but]] [[H1980|you shall go]] [[H413|to]] [[H1|my father’s]] [[H1004|house]] [[H413|and to]] [[H4940|my kindred]] [[H3947|to take]] [[H802|a wife]] [[H1121|for my son.’]] ^2438

[[H559|Then I asked]] [[H113|my master,]] [[H194|‘What if]] [[H802|the woman]] [[H3808|will not]] [[H1980|come]] [[H310|back with me?’]] ^2439

[[H559|And he told]] [[H413|me,]] [[H3068|‘The LORD,]] [[H6440|before]] [[H834|whom]] [[H1980|I have walked,]] [[H7971|will send]] [[H4397|His angel]] [[H854|with you]] [[H1870|and make your journey]] [[H6743|a success,]] [[H3947|so that you may take]] [[H802|a wife]] [[H1121|for my son]] [[H4940|from my kindred]] [[H1|and from my father’s]] [[H1004|house.]] ^2440

[[H227|Then,]] [[H3588|when]] [[H935|you go]] [[H413|to]] [[H4940|my kindred,]] [[H518|if]] [[H3808|they refuse to]] [[H5414|give her]] [[H1961|to you,  you will be]] [[H5355|released]] [[H423|from my oath.’]] ^2441

[[H935|So when I came]] [[H413|to]] [[H5869|the spring]] [[H3117|today,]] [[H559|I prayed,]] [[H3068|‘O LORD,]] [[H430|God]] [[H113|of my master]] [[H85|Abraham,]] [[H518|if only]] [[H3426|You would]] [[H1870|make my journey]] [[H6743|a success!]] ^2442

[[H2009|Here]] [[H595|I am,]] [[H5324|standing]] [[H5921|beside]] [[H5869|this spring.]] [[H1961|Now]] ⟨if⟩ [[H5959|a maiden]] [[H3318|comes out]] [[H7579|to draw water]] [[H559|and I say]] [[H413|to her,]] [[H4994|“Please]] [[H8248|let me drink]] [[H4592|a little]] [[H4325|water]] [[H3537|from your jar,”]] ^2443

[[H559|and she replies,]] [[H8354|“Drink,]] [[H7579|and I will draw water]] [[H1581|for your camels]] [[H1571|as well,”]] [[H1931|may she]] [[H802|be the woman]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H3198|has appointed]] [[H113|for my master’s]] [[H1121|son.]] ^2444

[[H2962|And before]] [[H589|I]] [[H3615|had finished]] [[H1696|praying]] [[H413|in]] [[H3820|my heart,]] [[H2009|there]] [[H7259|was Rebekah]] [[H3318|coming out]] [[H3537|with her jar]] [[H5921|on]] [[H7926|her shoulder,]] [[H3381|and she went down]] [[H5869|to the spring]] [[H7579|and drew water.]] [[H559|So I said]] [[H413|to her,]] [[H4994|‘Please]] [[H8248|give me a drink.’]] ^2445

[[H4116|She quickly]] [[H3381|lowered]] [[H3537|her jar]] [[H5921|from her]] ⟨shoulder⟩ [[H559|and said,]] [[H8354|‘Drink,]] [[H8248|and I will water]] [[H1581|your camels]] [[H1571|as well.’]] [[H8354|So I drank,]] [[H1571|and she also]] [[H8248|watered]] [[H1581|the camels.]] ^2446

[[H7592|Then I asked her,]] [[H4310|‘Whose]] [[H1323|daughter]] [[H859|are you?’]] [[H559|She replied,]] [[H1323|‘The daughter]] [[H1328|of Bethuel]] [[H1121|son]] [[H5152|of Nahor,]] [[H834|whom]] [[H4435|Milcah]] [[H3205|bore]] [[H7760|to him.’  So I put]] [[H5141|the ring]] [[H5921|on]] [[H639|her nose]] [[H6781|and the bracelets]] [[H5921|on]] [[H3027|her wrists.]] ^2447

[[H6915|Then I bowed down]] [[H7812|and worshiped]] [[H3068|the LORD;]] [[H1288|and I praised]] [[H3068|the LORD,]] [[H430|the God]] [[H113|of my master]] [[H85|Abraham,]] [[H834|who]] [[H5148|led]] [[H571|me on the right]] [[H1870|road]] [[H3947|to take]] [[H1323|the granddaughter]] [[H113|of my master’s]] [[H251|brother]] [[H1121|for his son.]] ^2448

[[H6258|Now]] [[H518|if]] [[H3426|you will]] [[H6213|show]] [[H2617|kindness]] [[H571|and faithfulness]] [[H854|to]] [[H113|my master,]] [[H5046|tell]] [[H518|me;  but if]] [[H3808|not,]] [[H5046|let me know,]] [[H6437|so that I may go]] [[H5921|elsewhere.”]] ^2449

[[H3837|Laban]] [[H1328|and Bethuel]] [[H6030|answered,]] [[H3318|“This is from]] [[H3068|the LORD;]] [[H3808|we have no]] [[H1697|choice in the matter.]] ^2450

[[H7259|Rebekah]] [[H2009|is here]] [[H6440|before you.]] [[H3947|Take]] [[H1980|her and go,]] [[H1961|and let her become]] [[H802|the wife]] [[H113|of your master’s]] [[H1121|son,]] [[H834|just as]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H1696|has decreed.”]] ^2451

[[H834|When]] [[H85|Abraham’s]] [[H5650|servant]] [[H8085|heard]] [[H1697|their words,]] [[H7812|he bowed down]] [[H776|to the ground]] [[H3068|before the LORD.]] ^2452

[[H5650|Then he]] [[H3318|brought out]] [[H3627|jewels]] [[H3701|of silver]] [[H2091|and gold,]] [[H899|and articles of clothing,]] [[H5414|and gave]] [[H7259|them to Rebekah.]] [[H5414|He also gave]] [[H4030|precious gifts]] [[H251|to her brother]] [[H517|and her mother.]] ^2453

[[H1931|Then he]] [[H376|and the men]] [[H5973|with]] [[H398|him ate]] [[H8354|and drank]] [[H3885|and spent the night there.]] [[H6965|When they got up]] [[H1242|the next morning,]] [[H559|he said,]] [[H7971|“Send me on my way]] [[H113|to my master.”]] ^2454

[[H251|But her brother]] [[H517|and mother]] [[H559|said,]] [[H5291|“Let the girl]] [[H3427|remain]] [[H854|with us]] [[H6218|ten]] [[H3117|days]] [[H176|or so.]] [[H310|After that,]] [[H1980|she may go.”]] ^2455

[[H559|But he replied,]] [[H408|“Do not]] [[H309|delay me,]] [[H3068|since the LORD]] [[H1870|has made my journey]] [[H6743|a success.]] [[H7971|Send me on my way]] [[H1980|so that I may go]] [[H113|to my master.”]] ^2456

[[H559|So they said,]] [[H7121|“We will call]] [[H5291|the girl]] [[H7592|and ask]] [[H6310|her opinion.”]] ^2457

[[H7121|They called]] [[H7259|Rebekah]] [[H559|and asked]] [[H413|her,]] [[H1980|“Will you go]] [[H5973|with]] [[H2088|this]] [[H376|man?”]] [[H1980|“I will go,”]] [[H559|she replied.]] ^2458

[[H7971|So they sent]] [[H269|their sister]] [[H7259|Rebekah]] ⟨on her way⟩, [[H3243|along with her nurse]] [[H85|and Abraham’s]] [[H5650|servant]] [[H376|and his men.]] ^2459

[[H1288|And they blessed]] [[H7259|Rebekah]] [[H559|and said]] [[H269|to her,  “Our sister,]] [[H859|may you]] [[H1961|become the mother]] [[H505|of thousands]] [[H7233|upon thousands.]] [[H2233|May your offspring]] [[H3423|possess]] [[H8179|the gates]] [[H8130|of their enemies.”]] ^2460

[[H7259|Then Rebekah]] [[H5291|and her servant girls]] [[H6965|got ready,]] [[H7392|mounted]] [[H1581|the camels,]] [[H1980|and followed]] [[H376|the man.]] [[H5650|So the servant]] [[H3947|took]] [[H7259|Rebekah]] [[H1980|and left.]] ^2461

[[H3327|Now Isaac]] [[H935|had just returned]] [[H935|from]] [[H883|Beer-lahai-roi,]] [[H1931|for he]] [[H3427|was living]] [[H5045|in the Negev.]] ^2462

[[H6153|Early in the evening]] [[H3327|Isaac]] [[H3318|went out]] [[H7704|to the field]] [[H7742|to meditate,]] [[H5375|and looking up,]] [[H7200|he saw]] [[H1581|the camels]] [[H935|approaching.]] ^2463

[[H7259|Rebekah]] [[H5375|lifted up]] [[H853|her]] [[H5869|eyes,]] [[H7200|and when she saw]] [[H3327|Isaac,]] [[H5307|she got down]] [[H5921|from]] [[H1581|her camel]] ^2464

[[H559|and asked]] [[H5650|the servant,]] [[H4310|“Who]] [[H1976|is that]] [[H376|man]] [[H7704|in the field]] [[H1980|coming]] [[H7125|to meet us?”]] [[H1931|“It]] [[H113|is my master,”]] [[H5650|the servant]] [[H559|answered.]] [[H3947|So she took]] [[H6809|her veil]] [[H3680|and covered herself.]] ^2465

[[H5650|Then the servant]] [[H5608|told]] [[H3327|Isaac]] [[H3605|all]] [[H834|that]] [[H6213|he had done.]] ^2466

[[H3327|And Isaac]] [[H935|brought]] [[H168|her into the tent]] [[H517|of his mother]] [[H8283|Sarah]] [[H3947|and took]] [[H7259|Rebekah]] [[H1961|as]] [[H802|his wife.]] [[H3327|And Isaac]] [[H157|loved her]] [[H5162|and was comforted]] [[H310|after]] [[H517|his mother’s death.]] ^2467

[[H85|Now Abraham]] [[H3947|had taken]] [[H3254|another]] [[H802|wife,]] [[H8034|named]] [[H6989|Keturah,]] ^2501

[[H3205|and she bore]] [[H2175|him Zimran,]] [[H3370|Jokshan,]] [[H4091|Medan,]] [[H4080|Midian,]] [[H3435|Ishbak,]] [[H7744|and Shuah.]] ^2502

[[H3370|Jokshan]] [[H3205|was the father of]] [[H7614|Sheba]] [[H1719|and Dedan.]] [[H1121|And the sons]] [[H1719|of Dedan]] [[H1961|were]] [[H805|the Asshurites,]] [[H3912|the Letushites,]] [[H3817|and the Leummites.]] ^2503

[[H1121|The sons]] [[H4080|of Midian]] [[H5891|were Ephah,]] [[H6081|Epher,]] [[H2585|Hanoch,]] [[H28|Abida,]] [[H420|and Eldaah.]] [[H3605|All]] [[H428|these]] [[H1121|were descendants]] [[H6989|of Keturah.]] ^2504

[[H85|Abraham]] [[H5414|left]] [[H3605|everything]] [[H3327|he owned to Isaac.]] ^2505

[[H5750|But while he was still]] [[H2416|alive,]] [[H85|Abraham]] [[H5414|gave]] [[H4979|gifts]] [[H1121|to the sons]] [[H834|of his]] [[H6370|concubines]] [[H7971|and sent them away]] [[H5921|from]] [[H1121|his son]] [[H3327|Isaac]] [[H413|to]] [[H776|the land]] [[H6924|of the east.]] ^2506

[[H85|Abraham]] [[H2416|lived]] [[H428|a total of]] [[H3967|175]] [[H8141|years.]] ^2507

[[H2896|And at a ripe]] [[H7872|old age]] [[H1478|he breathed his last]] [[H4191|and died,]] [[H2205|old]] [[H7649|and contented,]] [[H622|and was gathered]] [[H413|to]] [[H5971|his people.]] ^2508

[[H1121|His sons]] [[H3327|Isaac]] [[H3458|and Ishmael]] [[H6912|buried]] [[H413|him in]] [[H4631|the cave]] [[H4375|of Machpelah]] [[H5921|near]] [[H4471|Mamre,]] [[H413|in]] [[H7704|the field]] [[H6085|of Ephron]] [[H1121|son]] [[H6714|of Zohar]] [[H2850|the Hittite.]] ^2509

[[H7704|This was the field]] [[H834|that]] [[H85|Abraham]] [[H7069|had bought]] [[H1121|from the Hittites.]] [[H85|Abraham]] [[H6912|was buried]] [[H8033|there]] [[H802|with his wife]] [[H8283|Sarah.]] ^2510

[[H310|After]] [[H85|Abraham’s]] [[H4194|death,]] [[H430|God]] [[H1288|blessed]] [[H1121|his son]] [[H3327|Isaac,]] [[H3327|who]] [[H3427|lived]] [[H5973|near]] [[H883|Beer-lahai-roi.]] ^2511

[[H428|This]] [[H8435|is the account]] [[H85|of Abraham’s]] [[H1121|son]] [[H3458|Ishmael,]] [[H834|whom]] [[H1904|Hagar]] [[H4713|the Egyptian,]] [[H8283|Sarah’s]] [[H8198|maidservant,]] [[H3205|bore]] [[H85|to Abraham.]] ^2512

[[H2301|Hadad,]] [[H8485|Tema,]] [[H3195|Jetur,]] [[H5305|Naphish,]] [[H6929|and Kedemah.]] ^2515

[[H428|These]] [[H1992|were]] [[H1121|the sons]] [[H3458|of Ishmael,]] [[H428|and these]] [[H8034|were their names]] [[H2691|by their villages]] [[H2918|and encampments—]] [[H8147|twelve]] [[H5387|princes]] [[H523|of their tribes.]] ^2516

[[H3458|Ishmael]] [[H2416|lived]] [[H428|a total of]] [[H3967|137]] [[H8141|years.]] [[H1478|Then he breathed his last]] [[H4191|and died,]] [[H622|and was gathered]] [[H413|to]] [[H5971|his people.]] ^2517

⟨Ishmael’s descendants⟩ [[H7931|settled]] [[H2341|from Havilah]] [[H5704|to]] [[H7793|Shur,]] [[H834|which]] [[H5921|is near]] [[H6440|the border]] [[H4714|of Egypt]] [[H935|as you go]] [[H804|toward Asshur.]] [[H5307|And they lived]] [[H5921|in hostility]] [[H6440|toward]] [[H3605|all]] [[H251|their brothers.]] ^2518

[[H428|This]] [[H8435|is the account]] [[H85|of Abraham's]] [[H1121|son]] [[H3327|Isaac.]] [[H85|Abraham]] [[H3205|became the father of]] [[H3327|Isaac,]] ^2519

[[H3327|and Isaac]] [[H1961|was]] [[H705|forty]] [[H1121|years old]] [[H3947|when he married]] [[H7259|Rebekah,]] [[H1323|the daughter]] [[H1328|of Bethuel]] [[H761|the Aramean]] [[H6307|from  Paddan-aram]] [[H269|and the sister]] [[H3837|of Laban]] [[H761|the Aramean.]] ^2520

[[H3327|Later, Isaac]] [[H6279|prayed]] [[H3068|to the LORD]] [[H5227|on behalf of]] [[H802|his wife,]] [[H3588|because]] [[H1931|she]] ⟨was⟩ [[H6135|barren.]] [[H3068|And the LORD]] [[H6279|heard his prayer,]] [[H802|and his wife]] [[H7259|Rebekah]] [[H2029|conceived.]] ^2521

[[H1121|But the children]] [[H7130|inside her]] [[H7533|struggled with each other,]] [[H559|and she said,]] [[H4100|“Why]] [[H2088|is this]] [[H595|happening to me?”]] [[H1980|So went]] ⟨Rebekah⟩ [[H1875|to inquire]] [[H3068|of the LORD,]] ^2522

[[H3068|and]] ⟨He⟩ [[H559|declared  to her:]] [[H8147|“Two]] [[H1471|nations]] [[H990|are in your womb,]] [[H8147|and two]] [[H3816|peoples]] [[H4578|from within you]] [[H6504|will be separated;]] [[H3816|one people]] [[H553|will be stronger]] [[H3816|than the other,]] [[H7227|and the older]] [[H5647|will serve]] [[H6810|the younger.”]] ^2523

[[H3117|When her time]] [[H4390|came]] [[H3205|to give birth,]] [[H2009|there were indeed]] [[H8380|twins]] [[H990|in her womb.]] ^2524

[[H7223|The first]] [[H3318|one came out]] [[H132|red,]] [[H8181|covered with hair]] [[H155|like a fur coat;]] [[H7121|so they named]] [[H6215|him Esau.]] ^2525

[[H310|After]] [[H3651|this,]] [[H251|his brother]] [[H3318|came out]] [[H270|grasping]] [[H6215|Esau’s]] [[H6119|heel;]] [[H7121|so he was named]] [[H3290|Jacob.]] [[H3327|And Isaac]] [[H8346|was sixty]] [[H1121|years old]] [[H3205|when were born.]] ⟨the twins⟩ ^2526

[[H5288|When the boys]] [[H1431|grew up,]] [[H6215|Esau]] [[H1961|became]] [[H3045|a skillful]] [[H6718|hunter,]] [[H376|a man]] [[H7704|of the field,]] [[H3290|but Jacob]] [[H8535|was a quiet]] [[H376|man]] [[H3427|who stayed]] [[H168|at home.]] ^2527

[[H3588|Because]] [[H3327|Isaac]] [[H6310|had a taste]] [[H6718|for wild game,]] [[H157|he loved]] [[H6215|Esau;]] [[H7259|but Rebekah]] [[H157|loved]] [[H3290|Jacob.]] ^2528

[[H3290|One day, while Jacob]] [[H2102|was cooking]] [[H5138|some stew,]] [[H6215|Esau]] [[H935|came in]] [[H4480|from]] [[H7704|the field]] [[H1931|and]] [[H5889|was famished.]] ^2529

[[H6215|He]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H3290|Jacob,]] [[H3938|“Let me eat]] [[H4480|some of]] [[H2088|that]] [[H122|red]] ⟨stew⟩ [[H122|,]] [[H3588|for]] [[H595|I am]] [[H5889|famished.”]] [[H5921|(That is why]] [[H7121|he was also called]] [[H123|Edom.)]] ^2530

[[H3117|“First]] [[H4376|sell]] [[H1062|me  your birthright,”]] [[H3290|Jacob]] [[H559|replied.]] ^2531

[[H2009|“Look,”]] [[H559|said]] [[H6215|Esau,]] [[H595|“I am]] [[H1980|about to die,]] [[H4100|so what good]] [[H1062|is a birthright]] ^2532

[[H7650|“Swear to me first,”]] [[H3290|Jacob]] [[H559|said.]] [[H7650|So swore]] ⟨Esau⟩ [[H4376|to Jacob and sold]] [[H3290|him]] [[H1062|the birthright.]] ^2533

[[H3290|Then Jacob]] [[H5414|gave]] [[H3899|some bread]] [[H5742|and lentil]] [[H5138|stew]] [[H6215|to Esau;]] [[H398|he ate]] [[H8354|and drank,]] [[H6965|and then got up]] [[H1980|and went away.]] [[H6215|Thus Esau]] [[H959|despised]] [[H1062|his birthright.]] ^2534

[[H1961|Now there was]] [[H7458|another famine]] [[H776|in the land,]] [[H905|subsequent to]] [[H7458|the]] ⟨one⟩ [[H834|that]] [[H1961|had occurred]] [[H85|in Abraham’s]] [[H3117|time.]] [[H3327|And Isaac]] [[H1980|went]] [[H413|to]] [[H40|Abimelech]] [[H4428|king]] [[H6430|of the Philistines]] [[H1642|at Gerar.]] ^2601

[[H3068|The LORD]] [[H7200|appeared]] [[H413|to]] ⟨Isaac⟩ [[H559|and said,]] [[H408|“Do not]] [[H3381|go down]] [[H4714|to Egypt.]] [[H7931|Settle]] [[H776|in the land]] [[H834|where]] [[H559|I tell you.]] ^2602

[[H2063|Stay in this]] [[H776|land]] [[H1481|as a foreigner,]] [[H1961|and I will be]] [[H5973|with]] [[H1288|you and bless you.]] [[H3588|For]] [[H5414|I will give]] [[H3605|all]] [[H411|these]] [[H776|lands]] [[H2233|to you  and your offspring,]] [[H6965|and I will confirm]] [[H7621|the oath]] [[H834|that]] [[H7650|I swore]] [[H1|to your father]] [[H85|Abraham.]] ^2603

[[H2233|I will make your descendants]] [[H7235|as numerous]] [[H3556|as the stars]] [[H8064|in the sky,]] [[H5414|and I will give]] ⟨them⟩ [[H2233|]] [[H3605|all]] [[H411|these]] [[H776|lands,]] [[H2233|and through your offspring]] [[H3605|all]] [[H1471|nations]] [[H776|of the earth]] [[H1288|will be blessed,]] ^2604

[[H3327|So Isaac]] [[H3427|settled]] [[H1642|in Gerar.]] ^2606

[[H376|But when the men]] [[H4725|of that place]] [[H7592|asked]] [[H802|about his wife,]] [[H559|he said,]] [[H1931|“She]] [[H269|is my sister.”]] [[H3588|For]] [[H3372|he was afraid]] [[H559|to say,]] [[H802|“ my wife,”]] ⟨She is⟩ [[H6435|since he thought to himself,]] [[H376|“The men]] [[H4725|of this place]] [[H2026|will kill]] [[H5921|me on account of]] [[H7259|Rebekah,]] [[H3588|because]] [[H1931|she]] [[H2896|is so beautiful.”]] ^2607

[[H40|Abimelech]] [[H7121|sent for]] [[H3327|Isaac]] [[H559|and said,]] [[H1931|“So she]] [[H389|is really]] [[H802|your wife!]] [[H349|How]] [[H559|could you say,]] [[H1931|‘She]] [[H269|is my sister’?”]] [[H3327|Isaac]] [[H559|replied,]] [[H3588|“Because]] [[H559|I thought]] [[H6435|I might]] [[H4191|die]] [[H5921|on account of her.”]] ^2609

[[H4100|“What]] [[H2063|is this]] [[H6213|you have done]] [[H40|to us?”  Abimelech]] [[H559|said,]] [[H259|“One]] [[H5971|of the people]] [[H4592|could easily]] [[H7901|have slept with]] [[H802|your wife,]] [[H935|and you would have brought]] [[H817|guilt]] [[H5921|upon us.”]] ^2610

[[H3327|Now Isaac]] [[H2232|sowed seed]] [[H1931|in the]] [[H776|land,]] [[H1931|and in that very]] [[H8141|year]] [[H4672|he reaped]] [[H3967|a hundredfold.]] [[H3068|And the LORD]] [[H1288|blessed him,]] ^2612

[[H2658|And they dug]] [[H312|another]] [[H875|well]] [[H7378|and quarreled]] [[H5921|over]] [[H1571|that one also;]] [[H7121|so he named]] [[H8034|it]] [[H7856|Sitnah.]] ^2621

[[H6275|He moved on]] [[H8033|from there]] [[H2658|and dug]] [[H312|another]] ⟨well⟩, [[H3808|and they did not]] [[H7378|quarrel]] [[H5921|over it.]] [[H7121|He named]] [[H8034|it]] [[H7344|Rehoboth]] [[H559|and said,]] [[H3588|“At last]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H7337|has made room]] [[H6509|for us,  and we will be fruitful]] [[H776|in the land.”]] ^2622

[[H8033|From there]] ⟨Isaac⟩ [[H5927|went up]] [[H884|to Beersheba,]] ^2623

[[H1931|and that]] [[H3915|night]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H7200|appeared]] [[H413|to him]] [[H559|and said,]] [[H595|“I]] [[H430|am the God]] [[H1|of your father]] [[H85|Abraham.]] [[H408|Do not]] [[H3372|be afraid,]] [[H3588|for]] [[H595|I]] [[H854|am with you.]] [[H1288|I will bless]] [[H7235|you and multiply]] [[H2233|your descendants]] [[H5668|for the sake]] [[H5650|of My servant]] [[H85|Abraham.]] ^2624

[[H1129|So he built]] [[H4196|an altar]] [[H8033|there]] [[H7121|and called]] [[H8034|on the name]] [[H3068|of the LORD,]] [[H5186|and he pitched]] [[H168|his tent]] [[H8033|there.]] [[H3327|Isaac’s]] [[H5650|servants]] [[H3738|also dug]] [[H875|a well]] [[H8033|there.]] ^2625

[[H40|Later, Abimelech]] [[H1980|came]] [[H413|to]] ⟨Isaac⟩ [[H1642|from Gerar,]] [[H276|with Ahuzzath]] [[H4828|his adviser]] [[H6369|and Phicol]] [[H8269|the commander]] [[H6635|of his army.]] ^2626

[[H4069|“Why]] [[H935|have you come]] [[H413|to me?”]] [[H3327|Isaac]] [[H559|asked]] [[H413|them.]] [[H859|“You]] [[H8130|hated]] [[H853|me]] [[H7971|and sent me away.”]] ^2627

[[H7200|“We can plainly see]] [[H3588|that]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H1961|has been]] [[H5973|with you,”]] [[H559|they replied.]] [[H559|“We think]] [[H1961|there should be]] [[H423|an oath]] [[H996|between two parties—]] [[H996|between us and you.]] [[H3772|Let us make]] [[H1285|a covenant]] [[H5973|with you]] ^2628

[[H6213|So prepared]] ⟨Isaac⟩ [[H4960|a feast for them,]] [[H398|and they ate]] [[H8354|and drank.]] ^2630

[[H7925|And they got up early]] [[H1242|the next morning]] [[H7650|and swore an oath]] [[H376|to each]] [[H251|other.]] [[H3327|Then Isaac]] [[H7971|sent them on their way,]] [[H1980|and they left]] [[H7965|him in peace.]] ^2631

[[H1931|On that same]] [[H3117|day]] [[H3327|Isaac’s]] [[H5650|servants]] [[H935|came]] [[H5046|to tell]] [[H5921|him  about]] [[H875|the well]] [[H2658|they had dug,]] [[H559|telling him,]] [[H4672|“We have found]] [[H4325|water!”]] ^2632

[[H7121|He called]] [[H853|it]] [[H7656|Shibah,]] [[H5921|and]] [[H5704|to]] [[H2088|this]] [[H3117|day]] [[H8034|the name]] [[H5892|of the city]] [[H884|is Beersheba.]] ^2633

[[H6215|When Esau]] [[H1961|was]] [[H705|forty]] [[H1121|years old,]] [[H3947|he took]] [[H802|as his wives]] [[H3067|Judith]] [[H1323|daughter]] [[H882|of Beeri]] [[H2850|the Hittite]] [[H1315|and Basemath]] [[H1323|daughter]] [[H356|of Elon]] [[H2850|the Hittite.]] ^2634

[[H1961|And]] [[H7307|they brought]] [[H4786|grief]] [[H3327|to Isaac]] [[H7259|and Rebekah.]] ^2635

[[H3588|When]] [[H3327|Isaac]] [[H1961|was]] [[H2204|old]] [[H5869|and his eyes]] [[H3543|were so weak]] [[H7200|he could no longer see,]] [[H7121|he called]] [[H1419|his older]] [[H1121|son]] [[H6215|Esau]] [[H559|and said]] [[H413|to him,]] [[H1121|“My son.”]] [[H2009|“Here I am,”]] ⟨Esau⟩ [[H559|replied.]] ^2701

[[H2009|“Look,”]] [[H559|said]] ⟨Isaac⟩, [[H4994|“I am now]] [[H2204|old]] [[H3808|and do not]] [[H3045|know]] [[H3117|the day]] [[H4194|of my death.]] ^2702

[[H5375|Take]] [[H3627|your weapons—]] [[H8522|your quiver]] [[H7198|and bow—]] [[H3318|and go out]] [[H7704|in the field]] [[H6679|to hunt]] [[H6720|some game]] ^2703

[[H6213|Then prepare]] [[H4303|a tasty dish]] [[H834|that]] [[H157|I love]] [[H935|and bring]] [[H398|it to me  to eat,]] [[H5668|so that]] [[H5315|I]] [[H1288|may bless]] [[H2962|you before]] [[H4191|I die.”]] ^2704

[[H7259|Now Rebekah]] [[H8085|was listening]] [[H3327|to what Isaac]] [[H1696|told]] [[H1121|his son]] [[H6215|Esau.]] [[H6215|So when Esau]] [[H1980|went]] [[H7704|into the field]] [[H6679|to hunt]] [[H6718|game]] ⟨and⟩ [[H935|bring]] ⟨it back⟩, ^2705

[[H7259|Rebekah]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H1121|her son]] [[H3290|Jacob,]] [[H2009|“Behold,]] [[H8085|I overheard]] [[H1|your father]] [[H1696|saying]] [[H413|to]] [[H251|your brother]] [[H6215|Esau,]] ^2706

[[H6258|Now,]] [[H1121|my son,]] [[H8085|listen to]] [[H6963|my voice]] [[H834|and do exactly as]] [[H589|I]] [[H6680|tell]] [[H853|you.]] ^2708

[[H1980|Go out]] [[H413|to]] [[H6629|the flock]] [[H3947|and bring]] [[H8147|me two]] [[H2896|choice]] [[H1423|young goats,]] [[H6213|so that I can make]] [[H853|them]] [[H4303|into a tasty dish]] [[H1|for your father—]] [[H834|the kind]] [[H157|he loves.]] ^2709

[[H935|Then take]] [[H1|it to your father]] [[H398|to eat,]] [[H5668|so that]] [[H1288|he may bless]] [[H6440|you before]] [[H4194|he dies.”]] ^2710

[[H3290|Jacob]] [[H559|answered]] [[H517|his mother]] [[H7259|Rebekah,]] [[H2005|“Look,]] [[H251|my brother]] [[H6215|Esau]] [[H8163|is a hairy]] [[H376|man,]] [[H595|but I am]] [[H2509|smooth-skinned.]] ^2711

[[H194|What if]] [[H1|my father]] [[H4959|touches me?]] [[H1961|Then I would be revealed]] [[H5869|to him]] [[H8591|as a deceiver,]] [[H935|and I would bring]] [[H5921|upon myself]] [[H7045|a curse]] [[H3808|rather than]] [[H1293|a blessing.”]] ^2712

[[H517|His mother]] [[H559|replied,]] [[H7045|“Your curse]] [[H5921|be on me,]] [[H1121|my son.]] [[H389|Just]] [[H8085|obey]] [[H6963|my voice]] [[H1980|and go]] [[H3947|get them]] ^2713

[[H1980|So went]] ⟨Jacob⟩ [[H3947|and got]] ⟨two goats⟩ [[H935|and brought]] [[H517|them to his mother,]] [[H517|who]] [[H6213|made]] [[H4303|the tasty food]] [[H1|his father]] [[H157|loved.]] ^2714

[[H7259|And Rebekah]] [[H3947|took]] [[H2532|the finest]] [[H899|clothes]] [[H1004|in the house]] [[H834|that]] [[H854|belonged]] [[H1419|to her older]] [[H1121|son]] [[H6215|Esau,]] [[H3847|and she put them on]] [[H6996|her younger]] [[H1121|son]] [[H3290|Jacob.]] ^2715

[[H3847|She also put]] [[H5785|the skins]] [[H1423|of the young]] [[H5795|goats]] [[H5921|on]] [[H3027|his hands]] [[H5921|and on]] [[H2513|the smooth part]] [[H6677|of his neck.]] ^2716

[[H853|Then]] [[H5414|she handed]] [[H1121|her son]] [[H3290|Jacob]] [[H4303|the tasty food]] [[H3899|and bread]] [[H6213|she had made.]] ^2717

[[H935|So went]] ⟨Jacob⟩ [[H413|to]] [[H1|his father]] [[H559|and said,]] [[H1|“My father.”]] [[H2009|“Here I am!”]] [[H559|he answered.]] [[H4310|“Which one]] [[H859|are you,]] [[H1121|my son?”]] ^2718

[[H3290|Jacob]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H1|his father,]] [[H595|“I]] [[H6215|am Esau,]] [[H1060|your firstborn.]] [[H6213|I have done]] [[H834|as]] [[H1696|you told me.]] [[H4994|Please]] [[H3427|sit up]] [[H398|and eat]] [[H6718|some of my game,]] [[H5668|so that]] [[H5315|you]] [[H1288|may bless me.”]] ^2719

[[H3327|But Isaac]] [[H559|asked]] [[H1121|his son,]] [[H4100|“How]] [[H4672|did you ever find]] [[H2088|it so]] [[H4116|quickly,]] [[H1121|my son?”]] [[H3588|“Because]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H430|your God]] [[H7136|brought]] ⟨it⟩ [[H6440|to me,”]] [[H559|he replied.]] ^2720

[[H3327|Then Isaac]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H3290|Jacob,]] [[H4994|“Please]] [[H5066|come closer]] [[H4184|so I can touch you,]] [[H1121|my son.]] [[H859|Are you]] [[H2088|really]] [[H1121|my son]] [[H6215|Esau]] [[H518|or]] [[H3808|not?”]] ^2721

[[H3290|So Jacob]] [[H5066|came close]] [[H413|to]] [[H1|his father]] [[H3327|Isaac,]] [[H4959|who touched him]] [[H559|and said,]] [[H6963|“The voice]] [[H6963|is the voice]] [[H3290|of Jacob,]] [[H3027|but the hands]] [[H3027|are the hands]] [[H6215|of Esau.”]] ^2722

⟨Isaac⟩ [[H3808|did not]] [[H5234|recognize him,]] [[H3588|because]] [[H3027|his hands]] [[H1961|were]] [[H8163|hairy]] [[H3027|like those]] [[H251|of his brother]] [[H6215|Esau;]] [[H1288|so he blessed him.]] ^2723

[[H559|Again he asked,]] [[H859|“Are you]] [[H2088|really]] [[H1121|my son]] [[H6215|Esau?”]] [[H559|And he replied,]] [[H589|“I am.”]] ^2724

[[H5066|“Serve me,”]] [[H559|said]] ⟨Isaac⟩, [[H398|“and let me eat]] [[H1121|some of my son’s]] [[H6718|game,]] [[H4616|so that]] [[H5315|I]] [[H1288|may bless you.”]] [[H5066|Jacob brought it to him,]] [[H398|and he ate;]] [[H935|then he brought]] [[H3196|him  wine,]] [[H8354|and he drank.]] ^2725

[[H1|Then his father]] [[H3327|Isaac]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to him,]] [[H4994|“Please]] [[H5066|come near]] [[H5401|and kiss me,]] [[H1121|my son.”]] ^2726

[[H5066|So he came near]] [[H5401|and kissed him.]] [[H7306|When Isaac smelled]] [[H899|his clothing,]] [[H1288|he blessed]] [[H559|him and said:]] [[H7200|“Ah,]] [[H7381|the smell]] [[H1121|of my son]] [[H7381|is like the smell]] [[H7704|of a field]] [[H834|that]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H1288|has blessed.]] ^2727

[[H430|May God]] [[H5414|give]] [[H2919|to you  the dew]] [[H8064|of heaven]] [[H4924|and the richness]] [[H776|of the earth—]] [[H7230|an abundance]] [[H1715|of grain]] [[H8492|and new wine.]] ^2728

[[H5971|May peoples]] [[H5647|serve you]] [[H3816|and nations]] [[H7812|bow down to you.]] [[H1933|May you be]] [[H1376|the master]] [[H251|of your brothers,]] [[H1121|and may the sons]] [[H517|of your mother]] [[H7812|bow down to you.]] [[H779|May those who curse you]] [[H779|be cursed,]] [[H1288|and those who bless you]] [[H1288|be blessed.”]] ^2729

[[H834|As soon as]] [[H3327|Isaac]] [[H3615|had finished]] [[H1288|blessing]] ⟨him⟩ [[H3290|]] [[H3290|and Jacob]] [[H3318|had left]] [[H1|his father’s]] [[H6440|presence,]] [[H251|his brother]] [[H6215|Esau]] [[H935|returned]] [[H6718|from the hunt.]] ^2730

[[H1931|He]] [[H1571|too]] [[H6213|made]] [[H4303|some tasty food,]] [[H935|brought]] [[H1|it to his father,]] [[H559|and said]] [[H1|to]] ⟨him⟩, [[H1|“My father,]] [[H6965|sit up]] [[H398|and eat]] [[H1121|of your son’s]] [[H6718|game,]] [[H5668|so that]] [[H5315|you]] [[H1288|may bless me.”]] ^2731

[[H1|But his father]] [[H3327|Isaac]] [[H559|replied,]] [[H4310|“Who]] [[H859|are you?”]] [[H589|“I]] [[H6215|am Esau,]] [[H1060|your firstborn]] [[H1121|son,”]] [[H559|he answered.]] ^2732

[[H3327|Isaac]] [[H2729|began to tremble violently]] [[H559|and said,]] [[H4310|“Who]] [[H1931|was it,]] [[H645|then,]] [[H6679|who hunted]] [[H6718|the game]] [[H935|and brought it]] [[H2962|to me?  Before]] [[H935|you came in,]] [[H398|I ate]] [[H3605|it all]] [[H1288|and blessed him—]] [[H1571|and indeed,]] [[H1961|he will be]] [[H1288|blessed!”]] ^2733

[[H6215|When Esau]] [[H8085|heard]] [[H1|his father’s]] [[H1697|words,]] [[H6817|he let out]] [[H1419|a loud]] [[H4751|and bitter]] [[H6818|cry]] [[H559|and said]] [[H1|to his father,]] [[H1288|“Bless]] [[H1571|me too,]] [[H1|O my father!”]] ^2734

[[H559|But replied,]] ⟨Isaac⟩ [[H251|“Your brother]] [[H935|came]] [[H4820|deceitfully]] [[H3947|and took]] [[H1293|your blessing.”]] ^2735

[[H559|So declared,]] ⟨Esau⟩ [[H3588|“Is he not rightly]] [[H7121|named]] [[H3290|Jacob?]] [[H6117|For he has cheated]] [[H6471|me twice.]] [[H3947|He took]] [[H1062|my birthright,]] [[H2009|and]] [[H6258|now]] [[H3947|he has taken]] [[H1293|my blessing.”]] [[H559|Then he asked,]] [[H3808|“Haven’t]] [[H680|you saved]] [[H1293|a blessing for me?”]] ^2736

[[H3327|But Isaac]] [[H6030|answered]] [[H6215|Esau:]] [[H2005|“Look,]] [[H7760|I have made him]] [[H1376|your master]] [[H853|and]] [[H5414|given]] [[H3605|him  all]] [[H251|his relatives]] [[H5650|as servants;]] [[H5564|I have sustained]] [[H1715|him with grain]] [[H8492|and new wine.]] [[H4100|What]] [[H645|is left]] [[H6213|that I can do for you,]] [[H1121|my son?”]] ^2737

[[H6215|Esau]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H1|his father,]] [[H259|“Do you have only one]] [[H1293|blessing,]] [[H1|my father?]] [[H1288|Bless]] [[H1571|me too,]] [[H1|O my father!”]] [[H6215|Then Esau]] [[H1058|wept]] [[H5375|aloud.]] ^2738

[[H1|His father]] [[H3327|Isaac]] [[H6030|answered him:]] [[H2009|“Behold,]] [[H4186|your dwelling place]] [[H1961|shall be]] [[H4924|away from the richness]] [[H776|of the land,]] [[H2919|away from the dew]] [[H8064|of heaven]] [[H5921|above.]] ^2739

[[H2421|You shall live]] [[H5921|by]] [[H2719|the sword,]] [[H5647|and serve]] [[H251|your brother.]] [[H834|But when]] [[H7300|you rebel,]] [[H6561|you will tear]] [[H5923|his yoke]] [[H5921|from]] [[H6677|your neck.”]] ^2740

[[H6215|Esau]] [[H7852|held a grudge]] [[H3290|against Jacob]] [[H5921|because of]] [[H1293|the blessing]] [[H1|his father]] [[H1288|had given him.]] [[H6215|And Esau]] [[H559|said]] [[H3820|in his heart:]] [[H3117|“The days]] [[H60|of mourning]] [[H1|for my father]] [[H7126|are at hand;]] [[H2026|then I will kill]] [[H251|my brother]] [[H3290|Jacob.”]] ^2741

[[H1697|When the words]] [[H1419|of her older]] [[H1121|son]] [[H6215|Esau]] [[H5046|were relayed]] [[H7259|to Rebekah,]] [[H7971|she sent for]] [[H6996|her younger]] [[H1121|son]] [[H3290|Jacob]] [[H559|and told]] [[H413|him,]] [[H2009|“Look,]] [[H251|your brother]] [[H6215|Esau]] [[H5162|is consoling]] [[H2026|himself by  plotting to kill you.]] ^2742

[[H410|May God]] [[H7706|Almighty]] [[H1288|bless]] [[H853|you]] [[H6509|and make you fruitful]] [[H7235|and multiply you,]] [[H1961|so that you may become]] [[H6951|a company]] [[H5971|of peoples.]] ^2803

[[H5414|And may He give]] [[H1293|the blessing]] [[H85|of Abraham]] [[H2233|to  you and your descendants,]] [[H3423|so that you may possess]] [[H776|the land]] [[H4033|where you dwell as a foreigner,]] [[H834|the land]] [[H430|God]] [[H5414|gave]] [[H85|to Abraham.”]] ^2804

[[H3327|So Isaac]] [[H7971|sent]] [[H3290|Jacob]] [[H6307|to Paddan-aram,]] [[H413|to]] [[H3837|Laban]] [[H1121|son]] [[H1328|of Bethuel]] [[H761|the Aramean,]] [[H251|the brother]] [[H7259|of Rebekah,]] [[H517|the mother]] [[H3290|of Jacob]] [[H6215|and Esau.]] ^2805

[[H6215|Now Esau]] [[H7200|learned]] [[H3588|that]] [[H3327|Isaac]] [[H1288|had blessed]] [[H3290|Jacob]] [[H7971|and sent]] [[H6307|him to Paddan-aram]] [[H3947|to take]] [[H802|a wife]] [[H8033|there,]] [[H6680|commanding him,]] [[H3808|“Do not]] [[H3947|marry]] [[H3667|a Canaanite]] [[H1323|woman,”]] ^2806

[[H3290|and that Jacob]] [[H8085|had obeyed]] [[H1|his father]] [[H517|and mother]] [[H1980|and gone]] [[H6307|to Paddan-aram.]] ^2807

[[H6215|And]] [[H7200|seeing]] [[H3588|that]] [[H1|his father]] [[H3327|Isaac]] [[H7451|disapproved of]] [[H3667|the Canaanite]] [[H1323|women,]] ^2808

[[H6215|Esau]] [[H1980|went]] [[H413|to]] [[H3458|Ishmael]] [[H3947|and married]] [[H4258|Mahalath,]] [[H269|the sister]] [[H5032|of Nebaioth]] ⟨and⟩ [[H1323|daughter]] [[H85|of Abraham’s]] [[H1121|son]] [[H3458|Ishmael,]] [[H5921|in addition to]] [[H802|the wives]] ^2809

[[H3290|Meanwhile Jacob]] [[H3318|left]] [[H884|Beersheba]] [[H1980|and set out for]] [[H2771|Haran.]] ^2810

[[H6293|On reaching]] [[H4725|a certain place,]] [[H3885|he spent the night]] [[H8033|there]] [[H3588|because]] [[H8121|the sun]] [[H935|had set.]] [[H3947|And taking]] [[H68|one of the stones]] [[H4725|from that place,]] [[H7760|he put]] [[H4763|it under his head]] [[H7901|and lay down]] [[H4725|to sleep.]] ^2811

[[H2492|And dreamed]] ⟨Jacob⟩ [[H2009|about]] [[H5551|a ladder]] [[H5324|that rested]] [[H776|on the earth]] [[H7218|with its top]] [[H5060|reaching]] [[H8064|up to heaven,]] [[H430|and God’s]] [[H4397|angels]] [[H5927|were going up]] [[H3381|and down]] ⟨the ladder⟩. ^2812

[[H2009|And there]] [[H5921|at the top]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H5324|was standing]] [[H559|and saying,]] [[H589|“I]] [[H3068|am the LORD,]] [[H430|the God]] [[H1|of your father]] [[H85|Abraham]] [[H430|and the God]] [[H3327|of Isaac.]] [[H5414|I will give]] [[H2233|you and your descendants]] [[H776|the land]] [[H834|on which]] [[H859|you]] [[H7901|now lie.]] ^2813

[[H2233|Your descendants]] [[H1961|will be]] [[H6083|like the dust]] [[H776|of the earth,]] [[H6555|and you will spread out]] [[H3220|to the west]] [[H6924|and east]] [[H6828|and north]] [[H5045|and south.]] [[H3605|All]] [[H4940|the families]] [[H127|of the earth]] [[H1288|will be blessed]] [[H2233|through you  and your offspring.]] ^2814

[[H2009|Look,]] [[H595|I]] [[H5973|am with you,]] [[H8104|and I will watch over you]] [[H3605|wherever]] [[H1980|you go,]] [[H7725|and I will bring you back]] [[H413|to]] [[H2063|this]] [[H127|land.]] [[H3588|For]] [[H3808|I will not]] [[H5800|leave]] [[H5704|you until]] [[H6213|I have done]] [[H834|what]] [[H1696|I have promised]] ^2815

[[H3290|When Jacob]] [[H3364|woke up,]] [[H559|he thought,]] [[H403|“Surely]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H3426|is]] [[H2088|in this]] [[H4725|place,]] [[H595|and I]] [[H3045|was unaware of it.”]] ^2816

[[H3372|And he was afraid]] [[H559|and said,]] [[H4100|“How]] [[H3372|awesome]] ⟨is⟩ [[H2088|this]] [[H4725|place!]] [[H2088|This]] [[H369|is none]] [[H3588|other than]] [[H1004|the house]] [[H430|of God;]] [[H2088|this]] [[H8179|is the gate]] [[H8064|of heaven!”]] ^2817

[[H7925|Early]] [[H1242|the next morning,]] [[H3290|Jacob]] [[H3947|took]] [[H68|the stone]] [[H834|that]] [[H7760|he had placed]] [[H4763|under his head,]] [[H7760|and he set it up]] [[H4676|as a pillar.]] [[H3332|He poured]] [[H8081|oil]] [[H5921|on]] [[H7218|top of it,]] ^2818

[[H7121|and he called]] [[H1931|that]] [[H4725|place]] [[H1008|Bethel,]] [[H199|though]] [[H7223|previously]] [[H5892|the city]] [[H8034|had been named]] [[H3870|Luz.]] ^2819

[[H3290|Then Jacob]] [[H5087|made]] [[H5088|a vow,]] [[H559|saying,]] [[H518|“If]] [[H430|God]] [[H1961|will be]] [[H5978|with]] [[H8104|me and watch over]] [[H2088|me on this]] [[H1870|journey,]] [[H5414|and if He will provide]] [[H3899|me  with food]] [[H398|to eat]] [[H899|and clothes]] [[H3847|to wear,]] ^2820

[[H7725|so that I may return]] [[H7965|safely]] [[H413|to]] [[H1|my father’s]] [[H1004|house,]] [[H3068|then the LORD]] [[H1961|will be]] [[H430|my  God.]] ^2821

[[H2063|And this]] [[H68|stone]] [[H7760|I have set up]] [[H4676|as a pillar]] [[H1961|will be]] [[H430|God’s]] [[H1004|house,]] [[H3605|and of all]] [[H834|that]] [[H5414|You give]] [[H6237|me,  I will surely]] [[H6237|give You a tenth.”]] ^2822

[[H3290|Jacob]] [[H5375|resumed his journey]] [[H1980|and came]] [[H776|to the land]] [[H1121|of the sons]] [[H6924|of the east.]] ^2901

[[H7200|He looked]] [[H2009|and saw]] [[H875|a well]] [[H7704|in the field,]] [[H2009|and]] [[H8033|there]] [[H5921|by it]] [[H7257|lay]] [[H7969|three]] [[H5739|flocks]] [[H6629|of sheep,]] [[H3588|because]] [[H5739|the sheep]] [[H8248|were watered]] [[H4480|from]] [[H1931|this]] [[H875|well.]] [[H1419|And a large]] [[H68|stone]] [[H5921|covered]] [[H6310|the mouth]] [[H875|of the well.]] ^2902

[[H3605|When all]] [[H5739|the flocks]] [[H622|had been gathered]] [[H8033|there,]] [[H1556|the shepherds would roll away]] [[H68|the stone]] [[H5921|from]] [[H6310|the mouth]] [[H875|of the well]] [[H8248|and water]] [[H6629|the sheep.]] [[H7725|Then they would return]] [[H68|the stone]] [[H4725|to its place]] [[H5921|over]] [[H6310|the mouth]] [[H875|of the well.]] ^2903

[[H251|“My brothers,”]] [[H3290|Jacob]] [[H559|asked]] [[H370|the,  “where]] ⟨shepherds⟩ [[H859|are you from?”]] [[H587|“We are]] [[H2771|from Haran,”]] [[H559|they answered.]] ^2904

[[H3045|“Do you know]] [[H3837|Laban]] [[H1121|grandson]] [[H5152|of Nahor?”]] [[H559|Jacob asked.]] [[H3045|“We know him,”]] [[H559|they replied.]] ^2905

[[H7965|“Is he well?”]] [[H559|Jacob inquired.]] [[H7965|“Yes,”]] [[H559|they answered,]] [[H2009|“and here]] [[H935|comes]] [[H1323|his daughter]] [[H7354|Rachel]] [[H5973|with]] [[H6629|his sheep.”]] ^2906

[[H2005|“Look,”]] [[H559|said Jacob,]] [[H5750|“it is still]] [[H1419|broad]] [[H3117|daylight;]] [[H3808|it is not yet]] [[H6256|time]] [[H622|to gather]] [[H4735|the livestock.]] [[H8248|Water]] [[H6629|the sheep]] [[H1980|and take them back]] [[H7462|to pasture.”]] ^2907

[[H559|But they replied,]] [[H3808|“We cannot,]] [[H5704|until]] [[H3605|all]] [[H5739|the flocks]] [[H622|have been gathered]] [[H68|and the stone]] [[H1556|has been rolled]] [[H5921|away from]] [[H6310|the mouth]] [[H875|of the well.]] [[H8248|Then we will water]] [[H6629|the sheep.”]] ^2908

[[H5750|While]] [[H1696|he was still speaking]] [[H5973|with them,]] [[H7354|Rachel]] [[H935|arrived]] [[H5973|with]] [[H1|her father’s]] [[H6629|sheep,]] [[H3588|for]] [[H1931|she]] [[H7462|was a shepherdess.]] ^2909

[[H834|As soon as]] [[H3290|Jacob]] [[H7200|saw]] [[H7354|Rachel,]] [[H1323|the daughter]] [[H517|of his mother’s]] [[H251|brother]] [[H3837|Laban,]] [[H3837|with Laban’s]] [[H6629|sheep,]] [[H3290|he]] [[H5066|went up]] [[H1556|and rolled]] [[H68|the stone]] [[H5921|away from]] [[H6310|the mouth]] [[H875|of the well]] [[H8248|and watered]] [[H251|his uncle’s]] [[H6629|sheep.]] ^2910

[[H3290|Then Jacob]] [[H5401|kissed]] [[H7354|Rachel]] [[H1058|and wept]] [[H5375|aloud.]] ^2911

[[H3290|He]] [[H5046|told]] [[H7354|Rachel]] [[H3588|that]] [[H1931|he was]] [[H7259|Rebekah’s]] [[H1121|son,]] [[H251|a relative]] [[H1|of her father,]] [[H7323|and she ran]] [[H5046|and told]] [[H1|her father.]] ^2912

[[H3837|When Laban]] [[H8085|heard]] [[H8088|the news]] [[H269|about his sister’s]] [[H1121|son]] [[H3290|Jacob,]] [[H7323|he ran out]] [[H7125|to meet him,]] [[H2263|and he embraced]] [[H5401|him  and kissed him.]] [[H935|Then he took]] [[H413|him to]] [[H1004|his home,]] [[H5608|and Jacob told]] [[H3837|him]] [[H3605|all]] [[H1697|that had happened.]] ^2913

[[H3837|Then Laban]] [[H559|declared,]] [[H859|“You are]] [[H389|indeed]] [[H1320|my own flesh]] [[H6106|and blood.”]] [[H3427|After Jacob had stayed]] [[H5973|with]] [[H2320|him a month,]] ^2914

[[H3837|Laban]] [[H559|said]] [[H3290|to him,]] [[H3588|“Just because]] [[H859|you are]] [[H251|my relative,]] [[H5647|should you work]] [[H2600|for nothing?]] [[H5046|Tell]] [[H4100|me  what]] [[H4909|your wages should be.”]] ^2915

[[H3837|Now Laban]] [[H8147|had two]] [[H1323|daughters;]] [[H1419|the older]] [[H8034|was named]] [[H3812|Leah,]] [[H6996|and the younger]] [[H8034|was named]] [[H7354|Rachel.]] ^2916

[[H3812|Leah]] [[H7390|had no sparkle]] [[H5869|in her eyes,]] [[H7354|but Rachel]] [[H1961|was]] [[H3303|shapely]] [[H3303|and beautiful.]] ^2917

[[H3290|Since Jacob]] [[H157|loved]] [[H7354|Rachel,]] [[H559|he answered,]] [[H5647|“I will serve]] [[H7651|you seven]] [[H8141|years]] [[H6996|for your younger]] [[H1323|daughter]] [[H7354|Rachel.”]] ^2918

[[H3837|Laban]] [[H559|replied,]] [[H2896|“Better]] [[H5414|that I give]] [[H853|her]] [[H5414|to you  than]] [[H312|to another.]] [[H3427|Stay here]] [[H5978|with me.”]] ^2919

[[H3290|So Jacob]] [[H5647|served]] [[H7651|seven]] [[H8141|years]] [[H7354|for Rachel,]] [[H5869|yet it seemed]] ⟨but⟩ [[H259|a few]] [[H3117|days]] [[H157|because of his love]] [[H853|for her.]] ^2920

[[H3290|Finally Jacob]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H3837|Laban,]] [[H3051|“Grant]] [[H802|me my wife,]] [[H3588|for]] [[H3117|my time]] [[H4390|is complete,]] [[H935|and I want to sleep with]] [[H413|her.”]] ^2921

[[H3837|So Laban]] [[H3605|invited all]] [[H582|the men]] [[H4725|of that place]] [[H6213|and prepared]] [[H4960|a feast.]] ^2922

[[H1961|But when]] [[H6153|evening came,]] [[H3947|Laban took]] [[H1323|his daughter]] [[H3812|Leah]] [[H935|and gave]] [[H413|her to Jacob,]] [[H935|and he slept with]] [[H413|her.]] ^2923

[[H3837|And Laban]] [[H5414|gave]] [[H8198|his servant girl]] [[H2153|Zilpah]] [[H1323|to his daughter]] [[H3812|Leah]] [[H8198|as her maidservant.]] ^2924

[[H1242|When morning]] [[H1961|came,]] [[H2009|there]] [[H3812|was Leah!]] [[H4100|“What]] [[H6213|have you done]] [[H559|to me?”  Jacob said]] [[H413|to]] [[H3837|Laban.]] [[H3808|“Wasn’t]] [[H7354|it for Rachel]] [[H5647|that I served]] [[H5973|you?]] [[H4100|Why]] [[H7411|have you deceived me?”]] ^2925

[[H3837|Laban]] [[H559|replied,]] [[H3808|“It is not]] [[H6213|our custom]] [[H4725|here]] [[H6810|to give the younger daughter]] [[H5414|in marriage]] [[H6440|before]] [[H1067|the older.]] ^2926

[[H4390|Finish]] [[H2063|this]] [[H7620|week’s celebration,]] [[H5414|and we will give]] [[H2063|you  the younger one]] [[H5647|in return for]] [[H312|another]] [[H7651|seven]] [[H8141|years]] [[H5656|of work.”]] ^2927

[[H3290|And Jacob]] [[H6213|did]] [[H3651|just that.]] [[H4390|He finished]] [[H7620|the week’s celebration,]] [[H5414|and Laban gave]] [[H853|him]] [[H1323|his daughter]] [[H7354|Rachel]] [[H802|as his wife.]] ^2928

[[H3837|Laban also]] [[H5414|gave]] [[H8198|his servant girl]] [[H1090|Bilhah]] [[H1323|to his daughter]] [[H7354|Rachel]] [[H8198|as her  maidservant.]] ^2929

[[H935|Jacob slept with]] [[H7354|Rachel]] [[H1571|as well,]] [[H1571|and indeed,]] [[H157|he loved]] [[H7354|Rachel]] [[H3812|more than Leah.]] [[H5647|So he worked]] [[H5973|for]] [[H5750|Laban]] [[H312|another]] [[H7651|seven]] [[H8141|years.]] ^2930

[[H3068|When the LORD]] [[H7200|saw]] [[H3588|that]] [[H3812|Leah]] [[H8130|was unloved,]] [[H6605|He opened]] [[H7358|her womb;]] [[H7354|but Rachel]] ⟨was⟩ [[H6135|barren.]] ^2931

[[H3812|And Leah]] [[H2029|conceived]] [[H3205|and gave birth to]] [[H1121|a son,]] [[H7121|and she named]] [[H7205|him Reuben,]] [[H3588|for]] [[H559|she said,]] [[H3068|“The LORD]] [[H7200|has seen]] [[H6040|my affliction.]] [[H3588|Surely]] [[H376|my husband]] [[H157|will love]] [[H6258|me now.”]] ^2932

[[H5750|Again]] [[H2029|she conceived]] [[H3205|and gave birth to]] [[H1121|a son,]] [[H559|and she said,]] [[H3068|“Because the LORD]] [[H8085|has heard]] [[H3588|that]] [[H595|I]] [[H8130|am unloved,]] [[H5414|He has given]] [[H2088|me  this]] ⟨son⟩ [[H1571|as well.”]] [[H7121|So she named]] [[H8095|him Simeon.]] ^2933

[[H5750|Once again]] ⟨Leah⟩ [[H2029|conceived]] [[H3205|and gave birth to]] [[H1121|a son,]] [[H559|and she said,]] [[H6258|“Now]] [[H6471|at last]] [[H376|my husband]] [[H3867|will become attached]] [[H413|to me,]] [[H3588|because]] [[H3205|I have borne]] [[H7969|him  three]] [[H1121|sons.”]] [[H5921|So]] [[H7121|he was named]] [[H3878|Levi.]] ^2934

[[H5750|And once more,]] [[H2029|she conceived]] [[H3205|and gave birth to]] [[H1121|a son]] [[H559|and said,]] [[H6471|“This time]] [[H3034|I will praise]] [[H3068|the LORD.”]] [[H5921|So]] [[H7121|she named]] [[H3063|him Judah.]] [[H5975|Then Leah stopped]] [[H3205|having children.]] ^2935

[[H7354|When Rachel]] [[H7200|saw]] [[H3588|that]] [[H3808|she was not]] [[H3205|bearing]] [[H7354|any children]] [[H3290|for Jacob,]] [[H7065|she envied]] [[H269|her sister.]] [[H3051|“Give]] [[H1121|me  children,]] [[H518|or]] [[H595|I]] [[H4191|will die!”]] [[H559|she said]] [[H413|to]] [[H3290|Jacob.]] ^3001

[[H3290|Jacob]] [[H2734|became angry]] [[H7354|with Rachel]] [[H559|and said,]] [[H595|“Am I]] [[H8478|in the place]] [[H430|of God,]] [[H834|who]] [[H4513|has withheld]] [[H6529|children]] [[H4480|from you?”]] ^3002

[[H559|Then she said,]] [[H2009|“Here]] [[H519|is my maidservant]] [[H1090|Bilhah.]] [[H935|Sleep with]] [[H413|her,]] [[H3205|and she will bear children]] ⟨for me⟩ [[H1290|,]] [[H4480|so that through her]] [[H595|I]] [[H1571|too]] [[H1129|can build a family.”]] ^3003

[[H5414|So Rachel gave]] ⟨Jacob⟩ [[H853|]] [[H8198|her servant]] [[H1090|Bilhah]] [[H802|as his wife,]] [[H3290|and]] ⟨he⟩ [[H935|slept with]] [[H413|her,]] ^3004

[[H1090|and Bilhah]] [[H2029|conceived]] [[H3205|and bore]] ⟨him⟩ [[H3290|]] [[H1121|a son.]] ^3005

[[H7354|Then Rachel]] [[H559|said,]] [[H430|“God]] [[H1777|has vindicated me;]] [[H8085|He has heard]] [[H6963|my plea]] [[H5414|and given]] [[H1121|me  a son.”]] [[H7121|So she named]] [[H1835|him Dan.]] ^3006

[[H7354|And Rachel’s]] [[H8198|servant]] [[H1090|Bilhah]] [[H2029|conceived]] [[H5750|again]] [[H3205|and bore]] [[H3290|Jacob]] [[H8145|a second]] [[H1121|son.]] ^3007

[[H7354|Then Rachel]] [[H559|said,]] [[H5319|“In my great struggles,]] [[H6617|I have wrestled]] [[H5973|with]] [[H269|my sister]] [[H1571|and]] [[H3201|won.”]] [[H7121|So she named]] [[H8034|him]] [[H5321|Naphtali.]] ^3008

[[H3812|When Leah]] [[H7200|saw]] [[H3588|that]] [[H5975|she had stopped]] [[H3205|having children,]] [[H5414|she gave]] [[H8198|her servant]] [[H2153|Zilpah]] [[H3290|to Jacob]] [[H802|as a wife.]] ^3009

[[H3812|And Leah’s]] [[H8198|servant]] [[H2153|Zilpah]] [[H3205|bore]] [[H3290|Jacob]] [[H1121|a son.]] ^3010

[[H3812|Then Leah]] [[H559|said,]] [[H1409|“How fortunate!”]] [[H7121|So she named]] [[H1410|him Gad.]] ^3011

[[H3812|When Leah’s]] [[H8198|servant]] [[H2153|Zilpah]] [[H3205|bore]] [[H3290|Jacob]] [[H8145|a second]] [[H1121|son,]] ^3012

[[H3812|Leah]] [[H559|said,]] [[H837|“How happy I am,]] [[H3588|for]] [[H1323|the women]] [[H833|will call me happy.”]] [[H7121|So she named]] [[H8034|him]] [[H836|Asher.]] ^3013

[[H2406|Now during the wheat]] [[H7105|harvest,]] [[H7205|Reuben]] [[H1980|went out]] [[H4672|and found]] [[H1736|some mandrakes]] [[H7704|in the field.]] [[H935|When he brought]] [[H413|them to]] [[H517|his mother,]] [[H7354|Rachel]] [[H559|begged]] [[H3812|Leah,]] [[H4994|“Please]] [[H5414|give me]] [[H1121|some of  your son’s]] [[H1736|mandrakes.”]] ^3014

[[H559|But Leah replied,]] [[H4592|“Is it not enough]] [[H3947|that you have taken away]] [[H582|my husband?]] [[H1571|Now you]] [[H3947|want to take]] [[H1121|my son’s]] [[H1736|mandrakes?”]] ⟨as well⟩ [[H3651|“Very well,”]] [[H559|said]] [[H7354|Rachel,]] [[H7901|“he may sleep]] [[H5973|with you]] [[H3915|tonight]] [[H8478|in exchange for]] [[H1121|your son’s]] [[H1736|mandrakes.”]] ^3015

[[H3290|When Jacob]] [[H935|came in]] [[H4480|from]] [[H7704|the field]] [[H6153|that evening,]] [[H3812|Leah]] [[H3318|went out]] [[H7125|to meet him]] [[H559|and said,]] [[H935|“You must come]] [[H413|with me,]] [[H3588|for]] [[H7936|I have hired you]] [[H1121|with my son’s]] [[H1736|mandrakes.”]] [[H7901|So slept]] ⟨he⟩ [[H5973|with]] [[H1931|her that]] [[H3915|night.]] ^3016

[[H430|And God]] [[H8085|listened]] [[H413|to]] [[H3812|Leah,]] [[H2029|and she conceived]] [[H3205|and bore]] [[H2549|a fifth]] [[H1121|son]] [[H3290|to Jacob.]] ^3017

[[H3812|Then Leah]] [[H559|said,]] [[H430|“God]] [[H5414|has rewarded]] [[H834|me for]] [[H5414|giving]] [[H8198|my maidservant]] [[H376|to my husband.”]] [[H7121|So she named him]] [[H3485|Issachar.]] ^3018

[[H5750|Again]] [[H3812|Leah]] [[H2029|conceived]] [[H3205|and bore]] [[H8345|a sixth]] [[H1121|son]] [[H3290|to Jacob.]] ^3019

[[H430|“God]] [[H2064|has given]] [[H2896|me a good]] [[H2065|gift,”]] ⟨she⟩ [[H3812|]] [[H559|said.]] [[H6471|“This time]] [[H376|my husband]] [[H2082|will honor me,]] [[H3588|because]] [[H3205|I have borne]] [[H8337|him  six]] [[H1121|sons.”]] [[H7121|And she named]] [[H2074|him Zebulun.]] ^3020

[[H310|After that,]] [[H3205|Leah gave birth to]] [[H1323|a daughter]] [[H7121|and named]] [[H1783|her Dinah.]] ^3021

[[H430|Then God]] [[H2142|remembered]] [[H7354|Rachel.]] [[H430|He]] [[H8085|listened]] [[H413|to]] [[H6605|her and opened]] [[H7358|her womb,]] ^3022

[[H2029|and she conceived]] [[H3205|and gave birth to]] [[H1121|a son.]] [[H430|“God]] [[H622|has taken away]] [[H2781|my shame,”]] [[H559|she said.]] ^3023

[[H7121|She named]] [[H3130|him Joseph,]] [[H559|and said,]] [[H3068|“May the LORD]] [[H3254|add]] [[H312|to me  another]] [[H1121|son.”]] ^3024

[[H1961|Now]] [[H834|after]] [[H7354|Rachel]] [[H3205|had given birth to]] [[H3130|Joseph,]] [[H3290|Jacob]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H3837|Laban,]] [[H7971|“Send me on my way]] [[H1980|so I can return]] [[H413|to]] [[H4725|my homeland.]] ^3025

[[H5414|Give]] ⟨me⟩ [[H853|]] [[H802|my wives]] [[H853|and]] [[H3206|children,]] [[H834|for whom]] [[H5647|I have served you,]] [[H1980|and I will go on my way.]] [[H859|You]] [[H3045|know]] [[H834|how]] [[H5656|hard I have worked]] [[H5647|for you.”]] ^3026

[[H3837|But Laban]] [[H559|replied,]] [[H518|“If]] [[H4672|I have found]] [[H2580|favor]] [[H5869|in your eyes,]] [[H4994|please stay.]] [[H5172|I have learned by divination]] [[H3068|that the LORD]] [[H1288|has blessed]] [[H1558|me because of you.”]] ^3027

[[H559|And he added,]] [[H5344|“Name]] [[H7939|your wages,]] [[H5414|and I will pay them.”]] ^3028

[[H559|Then answered,]] ⟨Jacob⟩ [[H859|“You]] [[H3045|know]] [[H834|how]] [[H5647|I have served you]] [[H853|and]] [[H834|how]] ⟨well⟩ [[H4735|your livestock]] [[H1961|has fared]] [[H854|under my care.]] ^3029

[[H3588|Indeed,]] [[H1961|you had]] [[H4592|very little]] [[H6440|before my arrival,]] [[H7230|but now your wealth]] [[H6555|has increased many times over.]] [[H3068|The LORD]] [[H1288|has blessed]] [[H853|you]] [[H7272|wherever I set foot.]] [[H6258|But now,]] [[H4970|when]] [[H595|may I]] [[H1571|also]] [[H6213|provide]] [[H1004|for my own household?”]] ^3030

[[H4100|“What]] [[H5414|can I give]] [[H559|you?”  Laban asked.]] [[H3808|“You do not]] [[H5414|need to give]] [[H3972|me  anything,”]] [[H3290|Jacob replied.]] [[H518|“If]] [[H6213|you do]] [[H2088|this]] [[H1697|one thing]] [[H7725|for me,  I will keep on]] [[H7462|shepherding]] [[H8104|and keeping]] [[H6629|your flock.]] ^3031

[[H5674|Let me go]] [[H3605|through all]] [[H6629|your flocks]] [[H3117|today]] [[H5493|and remove]] [[H8033|from them]] [[H3605|every]] [[H5348|speckled]] [[H2921|or spotted]] [[H7716|sheep,]] [[H3605|every]] [[H2345|dark-colored]] [[H3775|lamb,]] [[H2921|and every spotted]] [[H5348|or speckled]] [[H5795|goat.]] [[H1961|These will be]] [[H7939|my wages.]] ^3032

[[H6666|So my honesty]] [[H6030|will testify]] [[H3588|for me  when]] [[H935|you come to check]] [[H5921|on]] [[H7939|my wages]] [[H3117|in the future.]] [[H854|If I have]] [[H3605|any]] [[H5795|goats]] [[H834|that]] [[H369|are not]] [[H5348|speckled]] [[H2921|or spotted,]] [[H3775|or any lambs]] [[H2345|that are not dark-colored,]] [[H1931|they]] [[H1589|will be considered stolen.”]] ^3033

[[H2005|“Agreed,”]] [[H559|said]] [[H3837|Laban.]] [[H1961|“Let it be]] [[H1697|as you have said.”]] ^3034

[[H1931|That very]] [[H3117|day]] [[H5493|Laban removed]] [[H6124|all the streaked]] [[H2921|or spotted]] [[H8495|male goats]] [[H853|and]] [[H3605|every]] [[H5348|speckled]] [[H2921|or spotted]] [[H5795|female goat—]] [[H3605|every one]] [[H834|that]] [[H3836|had any white]] [[H3605|on it—  and every]] [[H2345|dark-colored]] [[H3775|lamb,]] [[H5414|and he placed them]] [[H3027|under the care]] [[H1121|of his sons.]] ^3035

[[H7760|Then he put]] [[H7969|a three-day]] [[H1870|journey]] [[H996|between]] [[H3290|himself and Jacob,]] [[H3290|while Jacob]] [[H7462|was shepherding]] [[H3498|the rest]] [[H3837|of Laban’s]] [[H6629|flocks.]] ^3036

[[H3290|Jacob, however,]] [[H3947|took]] [[H3892|fresh]] [[H4731|branches]] [[H3839|of poplar,]] [[H3869|almond,]] [[H6196|and plane trees,]] [[H6478|and peeled]] ⟨the bark⟩ [[H4286|,  exposing]] [[H3836|the white]] [[H6479|inner wood]] [[H5921|of]] [[H4731|the branches.]] ^3037

[[H3322|Then he set]] [[H6478|the peeled]] [[H4731|branches]] [[H4325|in the watering]] [[H8268|troughs]] [[H5227|in front of]] [[H6629|the flocks]] [[H935|coming in]] [[H8354|to drink.]] [[H6629|So when the flocks]] [[H3179|were in heat]] [[H935|and came]] [[H8354|to drink,]] ^3038

[[H6629|they]] [[H3179|mated]] [[H413|in front of]] [[H4731|the branches.]] [[H3205|And they bore]] [[H6629|young]] ⟨that were⟩ [[H6124|streaked]] [[H5348|or speckled]] [[H2921|or spotted.]] ^3039

[[H3290|Jacob]] [[H6504|set apart]] [[H3775|the young,]] [[H5414|but made]] [[H6629|the]] ⟨rest⟩ [[H6440|face]] [[H6124|the streaked]] [[H2345|dark-colored]] [[H3837|sheep in Laban’s]] [[H6629|flocks.]] [[H7896|Then he set]] [[H5739|his own stock]] [[H905|apart]] [[H3808|and did not]] [[H7896|put]] [[H5921|them with]] [[H3837|Laban’s]] [[H6629|animals.]] ^3040

[[H3605|Whenever]] [[H7194|the stronger females]] [[H6629|of the flock]] [[H3179|were in heat,]] [[H3290|Jacob]] [[H7760|would place]] [[H4731|the branches]] [[H7298|in the troughs,]] [[H5869|in full view]] [[H6629|of the animals,]] [[H3179|so they would breed]] [[H4731|in front of the branches.]] ^3041

[[H6629|But if the animals]] [[H5848|were weak,]] [[H3808|he did not]] [[H7760|set out the branches.]] [[H5848|So the weaker animals]] [[H1961|went to]] [[H3837|Laban]] [[H7194|and the stronger ones]] [[H3290|to Jacob.]] ^3042

[[H376|Thus]] ⟨Jacob⟩ [[H3966|became]] [[H3966|exceedingly]] [[H6555|prosperous.]] [[H1961|He owned]] [[H7227|large]] [[H6629|flocks,]] [[H8198|maidservants]] [[H5650|and menservants,]] [[H1581|and camels]] [[H2543|and donkeys.]] ^3043

[[H8085|Now Jacob heard]] [[H3837|that Laban’s]] [[H1121|sons]] [[H1697|were saying,]] [[H3290|“Jacob]] [[H3947|has taken away]] [[H3605|all]] [[H834|that]] ⟨belonged to⟩ [[H1|our father]] [[H6213|and built]] [[H3605|all]] [[H2088|this]] [[H3519|wealth]] [[H834|at]] [[H1|our father’s expense.”]] ^3101

[[H3290|And Jacob]] [[H7200|saw]] [[H6440|from the countenance]] [[H3837|of Laban]] [[H5973|that his attitude toward]] [[H8543|him]] [[H369|had changed.]] ^3102

[[H3068|Then the LORD]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H3290|Jacob,]] [[H7725|“Go back]] [[H413|to]] [[H776|the land]] [[H1|of your fathers]] [[H4138|and to your kindred,]] [[H1961|and I will be]] [[H5973|with you.”]] ^3103

[[H3290|So Jacob]] [[H7971|sent word]] [[H7121|and called]] [[H7354|Rachel]] [[H3812|and Leah]] [[H7704|to the field]] [[H6629|where his flocks were,]] ^3104

[[H559|and he told]] [[H595|them,  “I]] [[H7200|can see]] [[H1|from your father’s]] [[H6440|face]] [[H3588|that]] [[H413|his attitude toward me]] [[H369|has changed;]] [[H430|but the God]] [[H1|of my father]] [[H1961|has been]] [[H5978|with me.]] ^3105

[[H859|You]] [[H3045|know]] [[H3588|that]] [[H5647|I have served]] [[H1|your father]] [[H3605|with all]] [[H3581|my strength.]] ^3106

[[H1|And although he]] [[H2048|has cheated]] [[H2498|me  and changed]] [[H4909|my wages]] [[H6235|ten]] [[H4489|times,]] [[H430|God]] [[H3808|has not]] [[H5414|allowed him]] [[H7489|to harm me.]] ^3107

[[H518|If]] [[H559|he said,]] [[H5348|‘The speckled]] [[H1961|will be]] [[H7939|your wages,’]] [[H3605|then the whole]] [[H6629|flock]] [[H3205|bore]] [[H5348|speckled offspring.]] [[H518|If]] [[H559|he said,]] [[H6124|‘The streaked]] [[H1961|will be]] [[H7939|your wages,’]] [[H3605|then the whole]] [[H6629|flock]] [[H3205|bore]] [[H6124|streaked offspring.]] ^3108

[[H430|Thus God]] [[H5337|has taken away]] [[H1|your father’s]] [[H4735|livestock]] [[H5414|and given]] ^3109

[[H6256|When]] [[H6629|the flocks]] [[H3179|were breeding,]] [[H5375|I saw]] [[H2472|in a dream]] [[H6124|that the streaked,]] [[H1261|spotted,]] [[H5348|and speckled]] [[H6260|males]] [[H5927|were mating]] [[H5921|with]] [[H6629|the females.]] ^3110

[[H2472|In that dream]] [[H4397|the Angel]] [[H430|of God]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to me,]] [[H3290|‘Jacob!’]] [[H559|And I replied,]] [[H2009|‘Here I am.’]] ^3111

[[H5375|‘Look up,’]] [[H559|He said,]] [[H7200|‘and see]] [[H3605|that all]] [[H6260|the males]] [[H5927|that are mating]] [[H5921|with]] [[H6629|the flock]] [[H6124|are streaked,]] [[H1261|spotted,]] [[H5348|or speckled;]] [[H3588|for]] [[H7200|I have seen]] [[H3605|all]] [[H834|that]] [[H3837|Laban]] [[H6213|has done]] ^3112

[[H595|I]] [[H410|am the God]] [[H1008|of Bethel,]] [[H834|where]] [[H4886|you anointed]] [[H4676|the pillar]] [[H5087|and made]] [[H5088|a solemn vow to Me.]] [[H6258|Now]] [[H6965|get up]] [[H3318|and leave]] [[H2063|this]] [[H776|land]] ⟨at once⟩, [[H7725|and return]] [[H413|to]] [[H4138|your native]] [[H776|land.’”]] ^3113

[[H7354|Then Rachel]] [[H3812|and Leah]] [[H6030|replied,]] [[H2506|“Do we  have any portion]] [[H5159|or inheritance]] [[H5750|left]] [[H1|in our father’s]] [[H1004|house?]] ^3114

[[H3808|Are we not]] [[H2803|regarded]] [[H5237|by him  as outsiders?]] [[H3588|Not only]] [[H4376|has he sold us,]] [[H1571|but he has]] [[H398|certainly squandered]] [[H3701|the money paid for us.]] ^3115

[[H3588|Surely]] [[H3605|all]] [[H6239|the wealth]] [[H834|that]] [[H430|God]] [[H5337|has taken away]] [[H1|from our father]] [[H1121|belongs to us  and to our children.]] [[H6258|So]] [[H6213|do]] [[H3605|whatever]] [[H430|God]] [[H559|has told]] [[H413|you.”]] ^3116

[[H3290|So Jacob]] [[H6965|got up]] [[H5375|and put]] [[H1121|his children]] [[H802|and his wives]] [[H5921|on]] [[H1581|camels,]] ^3117

[[H5090|and he drove]] [[H3605|all]] [[H4735|his livestock]] ⟨before him⟩, [[H3605|along with all]] [[H7399|the possessions]] [[H7408|he had acquired]] [[H6307|in Paddan-aram,]] [[H935|to go]] [[H413|to]] [[H1|his father]] [[H3327|Isaac]] [[H776|in the land]] [[H3667|in Canaan.]] ^3118

[[H3837|Now while Laban]] [[H1980|was out]] [[H1494|shearing]] [[H6629|his sheep,]] [[H7354|Rachel]] [[H1589|stole]] [[H1|her father’s]] [[H8655|household idols.]] ^3119

[[H3290|Moreover, Jacob]] [[H1589|deceived]] [[H3837|Laban]] [[H761|the Aramean]] [[H1097|by not]] [[H5046|telling]] [[H3588|him  that]] [[H1931|he]] [[H1272|was running away.]] ^3120

[[H1931|So he]] [[H1272|fled]] [[H3605|with all]] [[H834|his possessions,]] [[H5674|crossed]] [[H5104|the Euphrates,]] [[H7760|and headed for]] [[H2022|the hill country]] [[H1568|of Gilead.]] ^3121

[[H7992|On the third]] [[H3117|day]] [[H3837|Laban]] [[H5046|was informed]] [[H3588|that]] [[H3290|Jacob]] [[H1272|had fled.]] ^3122

[[H3947|So he took]] [[H251|his kinsmen]] [[H5973|with him,]] [[H7291|pursued]] [[H310|Jacob]] [[H7651|for seven]] [[H3117|days,]] [[H1692|and overtook]] [[H2022|him at Mount]] [[H1568|Gilead.]] ^3123

[[H3915|But that night]] [[H430|God]] [[H935|came]] [[H413|to]] [[H3837|Laban]] [[H761|the Aramean]] [[H2472|in a dream]] [[H559|and warned]] [[H8104|him,  “Be careful]] [[H6435|not]] [[H1696|to say]] [[H5973|anything to]] [[H3290|Jacob,]] [[H2896|either good]] [[H5704|or]] [[H7451|bad.”]] ^3124

[[H3290|Now Jacob]] [[H8628|had pitched]] [[H168|his tent]] [[H2022|in the hill country]] [[H1568|of Gilead,]] [[H3837|and when Laban]] [[H5381|overtook]] ⟨him⟩ [[H3290|,]] [[H3837|he]] [[H251|and his brothers]] [[H8628|camped]] ⟨there as well⟩ [[H2022|.]] ^3125

[[H3837|Then Laban]] [[H559|said]] [[H3290|to Jacob,]] [[H4100|“What]] [[H6213|have you done?]] [[H1589|You have deceived]] [[H853|me]] [[H1323|and carried off my daughters]] [[H7617|like captives]] [[H2719|of war!]] ^3126

[[H4100|Why]] [[H1272|did you run away]] [[H2244|secretly]] [[H1589|and deceive]] [[H853|me,]] [[H3808|without even]] [[H5046|telling]] [[H7971|me?  I would have sent you away]] [[H8057|with joy]] [[H7892|and singing,]] [[H8596|with tambourines]] [[H3658|and harps.]] ^3127

[[H3808|But you did not]] [[H5203|even let]] [[H5401|me kiss]] [[H1121|my grandchildren]] [[H1323|and daughters]] ⟨goodbye⟩. [[H6258|Now]] [[H6213|you have done]] [[H5528|a foolish thing.]] ^3128

[[H6213|I have power to do]] [[H5973|you]] [[H7451|great harm,]] [[H570|but last night]] [[H430|the God]] [[H1|of your father]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to me,]] [[H8104|‘Be careful]] [[H1696|not to say]] [[H5973|anything to]] [[H3290|Jacob,]] [[H2896|either good]] [[H5704|or]] [[H7451|bad.’]] ^3129

[[H6258|Now]] [[H1980|you have gone off]] [[H3588|because]] [[H3700|you long]] [[H1|for your father’s]] [[H1004|house.]] [[H4100|But why]] [[H1589|have you stolen]] [[H430|my gods?”]] ^3130

[[H3372|“I was afraid,”]] [[H3290|Jacob]] [[H6030|answered,]] [[H3588|“for]] [[H559|I thought]] ⟨you⟩ [[H3837|]] [[H1323|would take your daughters]] [[H5973|from me]] [[H1497|by force.]] ^3131

[[H4672|If you find]] [[H430|your gods]] [[H5973|with]] [[H834|anyone here,]] [[H3808|he shall not]] [[H2421|live!]] [[H5048|In the presence of]] [[H251|our relatives,]] [[H5234|see]] [[H4100|for yourself  if anything]] [[H5978|is yours,]] [[H3947|and take]] [[H3290|it back.”  For Jacob]] [[H3808|did not]] [[H3045|know]] [[H3588|that]] [[H7354|Rachel]] [[H1589|had stolen]] ⟨the idols⟩. ^3132

[[H3837|So Laban]] [[H935|went]] [[H3290|into Jacob’s]] [[H168|tent,]] [[H3812|then Leah’s]] [[H168|tent,]] [[H168|and then the tents]] [[H8147|of the two]] [[H519|maidservants,]] [[H4672|but he found]] [[H3808|nothing.]] [[H3318|Then he left]] [[H3812|Leah’s]] [[H168|tent]] [[H935|and entered]] [[H7354|Rachel’s]] [[H168|tent.]] ^3133

[[H7354|Now Rachel]] [[H3947|had taken]] [[H8655|Laban’s household idols,]] [[H7760|put]] [[H3733|them in the saddlebag]] [[H1581|of her camel,]] [[H3427|and was sitting]] [[H5921|on them.]] [[H3837|And Laban]] [[H4959|searched]] [[H3605|everything]] [[H168|in the tent]] [[H4672|but found]] [[H3808|nothing.]] ^3134

⟨Rachel⟩ [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H1|her father,]] [[H113|“Sir,]] [[H408|do not]] [[H2734|be angry]] [[H3588|that]] [[H3808|I cannot]] [[H6965|stand up]] [[H6440|before you;]] [[H3588|for]] [[H1870|I am having my period.”]] [[H2664|So Laban searched,]] [[H3808|but could not]] [[H4672|find]] [[H8655|the household idols.]] ^3135

[[H3290|Then Jacob]] [[H2734|became incensed]] [[H7378|and challenged]] [[H3837|Laban.]] [[H4100|“What]] [[H6588|is my crime?”]] [[H3290|he]] [[H559|said.]] [[H4100|“For what]] [[H2403|sin of mine]] [[H1814|have you so hotly pursued]] [[H310|me?]] ^3136

[[H4959|You have searched]] [[H3605|all]] [[H3627|my goods!]] [[H4672|Have you found]] [[H3605|anything]] [[H3627|that belongs to you?]] [[H7760|Put]] [[H3541|it here]] [[H5048|before]] [[H251|my brothers]] [[H251|and yours,]] [[H3198|that they may judge]] [[H996|between]] [[H8147|the two of us.]] ^3137

[[H595|I have]] [[H5973|been with]] [[H2088|you for]] [[H6242|twenty]] [[H8141|years now.]] [[H7353|Your sheep]] [[H5795|and goats]] [[H3808|have not]] [[H7921|miscarried,]] [[H3808|nor have I]] [[H398|eaten]] [[H352|the rams]] [[H6629|of your flock.]] ^3138

[[H3808|I did not]] [[H935|bring]] [[H413|you]] [[H2966|anything torn by wild beasts;]] [[H595|I]] [[H2398|bore the loss myself.]] [[H1245|And you demanded]] [[H3027|payment from me]] [[H1589|for what was stolen]] [[H3117|by day]] [[H3915|or night.]] ^3139

[[H1961|As it was,]] [[H2721|the heat]] [[H398|consumed me]] [[H3117|by day]] [[H7140|and the frost]] [[H3915|by night,]] [[H8142|and sleep]] [[H5074|fled]] [[H5869|from my eyes.]] ^3140

[[H2088|Thus]] [[H6242|for twenty]] [[H8141|years]] [[H5647|I have served]] [[H1004|in your household—]] [[H702|fourteen]] [[H8141|years]] [[H8147|for your two]] [[H1323|daughters]] [[H8337|and six]] [[H8141|years]] [[H6629|for your flocks—]] [[H2498|and you have changed]] [[H4909|my wages]] [[H6235|ten]] [[H4489|times!]] ^3141

[[H430|If the God]] [[H1|of my father,]] [[H430|the God]] [[H85|of Abraham]] [[H6343|and the One Feared]] [[H3327|by Isaac,]] [[H3884|had not]] [[H1961|been with me,]] [[H3588|surely]] [[H6258|by now]] [[H7971|you would have sent me away]] [[H7387|empty-handed.]] [[H430|But God]] [[H7200|has seen]] [[H6040|my affliction]] [[H3018|and the toil]] [[H3709|of my hands,]] [[H570|and last night]] [[H3198|He rendered judgment.”]] ^3142

[[H3837|But Laban]] [[H6030|answered]] [[H3290|Jacob,]] [[H1323|“ daughters]] ⟨These⟩ [[H1323|are my daughters,]] ⟨these⟩ [[H1121|sons]] ⟨are⟩ [[H1121|my sons,]] [[H6629|and flocks]] ⟨these⟩ ⟨are⟩ [[H6629|my flocks!]] [[H3605|Everything]] [[H859|you]] [[H7200|see is mine!]] [[H4100|Yet what]] [[H6213|can I do]] [[H3117|today]] [[H428|about these]] [[H1323|daughters]] [[H176|of mine or]] [[H1121|the children]] [[H3205|they have borne?]] ^3143

[[H1980|Come]] [[H6258|now,]] [[H3772|let us make]] [[H1285|a covenant,]] [[H859|you]] [[H589|and I,]] [[H1961|and let it serve as]] [[H5707|a witness]] [[H996|between]] [[H996|you and me.”]] ^3144

[[H3290|So Jacob]] [[H3947|picked out]] [[H68|a stone]] [[H7311|and set it up]] [[H4676|as a pillar,]] ^3145

[[H3290|and]] ⟨he⟩ [[H559|said]] [[H251|to his relatives,]] [[H3950|“Gather]] ⟨some⟩ [[H68|stones.”]] [[H3947|So they took]] [[H68|stones]] [[H6213|and made]] [[H1530|a mound,]] [[H8033|and there]] [[H5921|by]] [[H1530|the mound]] [[H398|they ate.]] ^3146

[[H3837|Laban]] [[H7121|named]] [[H3026|it Jegar-sahadutha,]] [[H3290|but Jacob]] [[H7121|called it]] [[H1567|Galeed.]] ^3147

[[H3837|Then Laban]] [[H559|declared,]] [[H2088|“This]] [[H1530|mound]] [[H5707|is a witness]] [[H996|between you]] [[H996|and me]] [[H3117|this day.”]] [[H5921|Therefore]] [[H7121|the place was called]] [[H1567|Galeed,]] ^3148

[[H4709|and also Mizpah,]] [[H834|because]] [[H559|he said,]] [[H3068|“May the LORD]] [[H6822|keep watch]] [[H996|between you]] [[H996|and me]] [[H3588|when]] [[H5641|we are absent]] [[H7453|from one another.]] ^3149

[[H518|If]] [[H6031|you mistreat]] [[H1323|my daughters]] [[H518|or]] [[H3947|take]] [[H5921|other]] [[H802|wives,]] [[H369|although no]] [[H376|one]] [[H5973|is with us,]] [[H7200|remember]] [[H430|that God]] ⟨is⟩ [[H5707|witness]] [[H996|between you and me.”]] ^3150

[[H3837|Laban]] [[H559|also said]] [[H3290|to Jacob,]] [[H2009|“Here is]] [[H2088|the]] [[H1530|mound,]] [[H4676|and here is the pillar]] [[H3384|I have set up]] [[H996|between you and me.]] ^3151

[[H2088|This]] [[H1530|mound]] [[H5707|is a witness,]] [[H4676|and this pillar]] [[H5713|is a witness,]] [[H518|that]] [[H589|I]] [[H3808|will not]] [[H5674|go past]] [[H2088|this]] [[H1530|mound]] [[H413|to harm you,]] [[H859|and you]] [[H3808|will not]] [[H5674|go past]] [[H2088|this]] [[H1530|mound]] [[H2063|and]] [[H4676|pillar]] [[H7451|to harm me.]] ^3152

[[H430|May the God]] [[H85|of Abraham]] [[H430|and the God]] [[H5152|of Nahor,]] [[H430|the God]] [[H1|of their father,]] [[H8199|judge]] [[H996|between us.”]] [[H3290|So Jacob]] [[H7650|swore]] [[H6343|by the One feared]] [[H1|by his father]] [[H3327|Isaac.]] ^3153

[[H3290|Then Jacob]] [[H2076|offered]] [[H2077|a sacrifice]] [[H2022|on the mountain]] [[H7121|and invited]] [[H251|his kinsmen]] [[H398|to eat]] [[H3899|a meal.]] [[H398|And after they had eaten,]] [[H3885|they spent the night]] [[H2022|on the mountain.]] ^3154

[[H1242|Early the next morning,]] [[H3837|Laban]] [[H7925|got up]] [[H5401|and kissed]] [[H1121|his grandchildren]] [[H1323|and daughters]] [[H1288|and blessed them.]] [[H3837|Then]] ⟨he⟩ [[H1980|left]] [[H7725|to return]] [[H4725|home.]] ^3155

[[H3290|Jacob also]] [[H1980|went]] [[H1870|on his way,]] [[H4397|and the angels]] [[H430|of God]] [[H6293|met him.]] ^3201

[[H834|When]] ⟨Jacob⟩ [[H7200|saw them,]] ⟨he⟩ [[H3290|]] [[H559|said,]] [[H2088|“This]] [[H4264|is the camp]] [[H430|of God.”]] [[H7121|So he named]] [[H1931|that]] [[H4725|place]] [[H4266|Mahanaim.]] ^3202

[[H3290|Jacob]] [[H7971|sent]] [[H4397|messengers]] [[H6440|ahead of]] [[H413|him to]] [[H251|his brother]] [[H6215|Esau]] [[H776|in the land]] [[H8165|of Seir,]] [[H7704|the country]] [[H123|of Edom.]] ^3203

[[H6680|He instructed them,]] [[H559|“You are to say]] [[H113|to my master]] [[H6215|Esau,]] [[H5650|‘Your servant]] [[H3290|Jacob]] [[H559|says:]] [[H1481|I have been staying]] [[H5973|with]] [[H3837|Laban]] [[H309|and have remained there]] [[H5704|until]] [[H6258|now.]] ^3204

[[H1961|I have]] [[H7794|oxen,]] [[H2543|donkeys,]] [[H6629|flocks,]] [[H5650|menservants,]] [[H8198|and maidservants.]] [[H7971|I have sent]] [[H5046|this message to inform]] [[H113|my master,]] [[H4672|so that I may find]] [[H2580|favor]] [[H5869|in your sight.’”]] ^3205

[[H4397|When the messengers]] [[H7725|returned]] [[H413|to]] [[H3290|Jacob,]] [[H559|they said,]] [[H935|“We went]] [[H413|to]] [[H251|your brother]] [[H6215|Esau;]] [[H1980|he is coming]] [[H7125|to meet you—]] [[H702|he and four]] [[H3967|hundred]] [[H376|men]] [[H5973|with him.”]] ^3206

[[H3966|In great]] [[H3372|fear]] [[H3334|and distress,]] [[H3290|Jacob]] [[H2673|divided]] [[H854|his]] [[H5971|people]] [[H8147|into two]] [[H4264|camps,]] [[H6629|as well as the flocks]] [[H1241|and herds]] [[H1581|and camels.]] ^3207

[[H559|He thought,]] [[H518|“If]] [[H6215|Esau]] [[H935|comes]] [[H5221|and attacks]] [[H259|one]] [[H4264|camp,]] [[H1961|then]] [[H7604|the other]] [[H4264|camp]] [[H6413|can escape.”]] ^3208

[[H3290|Then Jacob]] [[H559|declared,]] [[H430|“O God]] [[H1|of my father]] [[H85|Abraham,]] [[H430|God]] [[H1|of my father]] [[H3327|Isaac,]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H559|who told]] [[H413|me,]] [[H7725|‘Go back]] [[H776|to your country]] [[H4138|and to your kindred,]] [[H3190|and I will make you prosper,’]] ^3209

[[H6994|I am unworthy]] [[H3605|of all]] [[H2617|the kindness]] [[H571|and faithfulness]] [[H6213|You have shown]] [[H5650|Your servant.]] [[H3588|Indeed,]] [[H4731|with only my staff]] [[H5674|I came across]] [[H2088|the]] [[H3383|Jordan,]] [[H6258|but now]] [[H1961|I have become]] [[H8147|two]] [[H4264|camps.]] ^3210

[[H4994|Please]] [[H5337|deliver me]] [[H3027|from the hand]] [[H251|of my brother]] [[H6215|Esau,]] [[H3588|for]] [[H595|I]] [[H3373|am afraid that]] [[H935|he may come]] [[H5221|and attack me,]] [[H517|and also the mothers]] [[H5921|and]] [[H1121|their children]] ⟨with me⟩. ^3211

[[H859|But You]] [[H559|have said,]] [[H3190|‘I will surely]] [[H3190|make you prosper,]] [[H7760|and I will make]] [[H2233|your offspring]] [[H2344|like the sand]] [[H3220|of the sea,]] [[H7230|too numerous]] [[H5608|to count.’”]] ^3212

⟨Jacob⟩ [[H3885|spent]] [[H1931|the]] [[H3915|night]] [[H8033|there,]] [[H935|and from what he had brought]] [[H3027|with him,]] [[H3947|he selected]] [[H4503|a gift]] [[H251|for his brother]] [[H6215|Esau:]] ^3213

[[H3967|200]] [[H5795|female goats,]] [[H6242|20]] [[H8495|male goats,]] [[H3967|200]] [[H7353|ewes,]] [[H6242|20]] [[H352|rams,]] ^3214

[[H7970|30]] [[H3243|milk]] [[H1581|camels]] [[H1121|with their young,]] [[H705|40]] [[H6510|cows,]] [[H6235|10]] [[H6499|bulls,]] [[H6242|20]] [[H860|female donkeys,]] [[H6235|and 10]] [[H5895|male donkeys.]] ^3215

[[H5414|He entrusted them to]] [[H5650|his servants]] [[H905|in separate]] [[H5739|herds]] [[H559|and told]] [[H5650|them,]] [[H5674|“Go on]] [[H6440|ahead of me,]] [[H7760|and keep]] [[H7305|some distance]] [[H996|between]] [[H5739|the herds.”]] ^3216

[[H6680|He instructed]] [[H7223|the one in the lead,]] [[H3588|“When]] [[H251|my brother]] [[H6215|Esau]] [[H6298|meets]] [[H7592|you and asks,]] [[H4310|‘To whom]] [[H859|do you belong,]] [[H575|where]] [[H1980|are you going,]] [[H4310|and whose]] [[H428|animals are these]] [[H6440|before you?’]] ^3217

[[H559|then you are to say,]] [[H5650|‘They belong to your servant]] [[H3290|Jacob.]] [[H1931|They]] [[H4503|are a gift,]] [[H7971|sent]] [[H113|to my lord]] [[H6215|Esau.]] [[H2009|And behold,]] ⟨Jacob⟩ [[H1931|]] [[H310|is behind us.’”]] ^3218

[[H1571|He also]] [[H6680|instructed]] [[H8145|the second,]] [[H7992|the third,]] [[H1571|and]] [[H3605|all those]] [[H1980|following]] [[H310|behind]] [[H5739|the herds:]] [[H4672|“When you meet]] [[H6215|Esau,]] [[H1696|you are to say]] [[H2088|the same]] [[H1697|thing]] [[H413|to]] [[H853|him.]] ^3219

[[H1571|You are also]] [[H559|to say,]] [[H2009|‘Look,]] [[H5650|your servant]] [[H3290|Jacob]] [[H310|is right behind us.’”]] [[H3588|For]] [[H559|he thought,]] [[H3722|“I will appease]] ⟨Esau⟩ [[H6440|]] [[H4503|with the gift]] [[H1980|that is going]] [[H6440|before me.]] [[H310|After]] [[H3651|that]] [[H7200|I can face]] [[H6440|him,]] [[H194|and perhaps]] [[H5375|he will accept]] [[H6440|me.”]] ^3220

[[H4503|So gifts]] ⟨Jacob’s⟩ [[H5674|went]] [[H5921|on before]] [[H6440|him,]] [[H1931|while he]] [[H3885|spent]] [[H1931|the]] [[H3915|night]] [[H4264|in the camp.]] ^3221

[[H3915|During the night]] [[H6965|Jacob got up]] [[H3947|and took]] [[H8147|his two]] [[H802|wives,]] [[H8147|his two]] [[H8198|maidservants,]] [[H259|and his eleven]] [[H3206|sons,]] [[H5674|and crossed]] [[H4569|the ford]] [[H2999|of Jabbok.]] ^3222

[[H3947|He took]] [[H5674|them and sent them across]] [[H5158|the stream,]] [[H834|along with all his possessions.]] ^3223

[[H3290|So Jacob]] [[H3498|was left]] [[H905|all alone,]] [[H582|and a man]] ⟨there⟩ [[H79|wrestled]] [[H5973|with him]] [[H5704|until]] [[H5927|daybreak.]] ^3224

[[H7200|When the man saw]] [[H3588|that]] [[H3808|He could not]] [[H3201|overpower]] ⟨Jacob⟩, [[H5060|He struck]] [[H3709|the socket]] [[H3409|of Jacob’s hip]] [[H3363|and dislocated]] ⟨it⟩ [[H3290|]] [[H5973|as they]] [[H79|wrestled.]] ^3225

[[H559|Then said,]] ⟨the man⟩ [[H7971|“Let Me go,]] [[H3588|for]] [[H5927|it is daybreak.”]] [[H559|But Jacob replied,]] [[H3808|“I will not]] [[H7971|let You go]] [[H3588|unless]] [[H1288|You bless me.”]] ^3226

[[H4100|“What]] [[H8034|is your name?”]] [[H559|the man asked.]] [[H3290|“Jacob,”]] [[H559|he replied.]] ^3227

[[H559|Then said,]] ⟨the man⟩ [[H8034|“Your name]] [[H3808|will no]] [[H5750|longer]] [[H559|be]] [[H3290|Jacob,]] [[H3478|but Israel,]] [[H3588|because]] [[H8280|you have struggled]] [[H5973|with]] [[H430|God]] [[H5973|and with]] [[H376|men,]] [[H3201|and you have prevailed.”]] ^3228

[[H3290|Then Jacob]] [[H7592|asked him,]] [[H4994|“Please]] [[H5046|tell]] [[H8034|me Your name.”]] [[H4100|“Why]] [[H7592|do you ask]] [[H8034|My name?”]] [[H559|he replied.]] [[H1288|And He blessed]] ⟨Jacob⟩ [[H8033|there.]] ^3229

[[H3290|So Jacob]] [[H7121|named]] [[H4725|the place]] [[H6439|Peniel,]] [[H3588|saying, “Indeed,]] [[H7200|I have seen]] [[H430|God]] [[H6440|face]] [[H413|to]] [[H6440|face,]] [[H5315|and yet my life]] [[H5337|was spared.”]] ^3230

[[H8121|The sun]] [[H2224|rose]] [[H834|above him  as]] [[H5674|he passed by]] [[H6439|Penuel,]] [[H1931|and he]] [[H6760|was limping]] [[H5921|because of]] [[H3409|his hip.]] ^3231

[[H3290|Now Jacob]] [[H5375|looked up]] [[H7200|and saw]] [[H6215|Esau]] [[H935|coming]] [[H5973|toward him with]] [[H702|four]] [[H3967|hundred]] [[H376|men.]] [[H2673|So he divided]] [[H3206|the children]] [[H3812|among Leah,]] [[H7354|Rachel,]] [[H8147|and the two]] [[H8198|maidservants.]] ^3301

[[H7760|He put]] [[H8198|the maidservants]] [[H853|and their]] [[H3206|children]] [[H7223|in front,]] [[H3812|Leah]] [[H3206|and her children]] [[H314|next,]] [[H7354|and Rachel]] [[H3130|and Joseph]] [[H314|at the rear.]] ^3302

[[H1931|But]] ⟨Jacob⟩ [[H5674|himself went on]] [[H6440|ahead]] [[H7812|and bowed]] [[H776|to the ground]] [[H7651|seven]] [[H6471|times]] [[H5704|as]] [[H5066|he approached]] [[H251|his brother.]] ^3303

[[H6215|Esau, however,]] [[H7323|ran to him]] [[H2263|and embraced him,]] [[H5307|threw his arms around]] [[H6677|his neck,]] [[H5401|and kissed him.]] [[H1058|And they both wept.]] ^3304

[[H5375|When Esau looked up]] [[H7200|and saw]] [[H802|the women]] [[H3206|and children,]] [[H559|he asked,]] [[H4310|“Who]] [[H428|are these]] [[H559|with you?” answered,]] ⟨Jacob⟩ [[H3206|“ the children]] ⟨These are⟩ [[H430|God]] [[H2603|has graciously given]] [[H5650|your servant.”]] ^3305

[[H8198|Then the maidservants]] [[H2007|and their]] [[H3206|children]] [[H5066|approached]] [[H7812|and bowed down.]] ^3306

[[H3812|Leah]] [[H3206|and her children]] [[H1571|also]] [[H5066|approached]] [[H7812|and bowed down,]] [[H310|and then]] [[H3130|Joseph]] [[H7354|and Rachel]] [[H5066|approached]] [[H7812|and bowed down.]] ^3307

[[H4310|“What]] [[H2088|do you mean by sending this]] [[H3605|whole]] [[H4264|company]] [[H6298|to meet me?”]] [[H559|asked Esau.]] [[H4672|“To find]] [[H2580|favor]] [[H5869|in your sight,]] [[H113|my lord,”]] ⟨Jacob⟩ [[H559|answered.]] ^3308

[[H3426|“I already have]] [[H7227|plenty,]] [[H251|my brother,”]] [[H6215|Esau]] [[H559|replied.]] [[H1961|“Keep]] [[H834|what belongs to you.”]] ^3309

[[H3290|But Jacob]] [[H559|insisted,]] [[H408|“No,]] [[H4994|please!]] [[H518|If]] [[H4672|I have found]] [[H2580|favor]] [[H5869|in your sight,]] [[H3947|then receive]] [[H4503|this gift]] [[H3027|from my hand.]] [[H5921|For]] [[H3588|indeed,]] [[H7200|I have seen]] [[H6440|your face,]] [[H7200|and it is like seeing]] [[H6440|the face]] [[H430|of God,]] [[H7521|since you have received me favorably.]] ^3310

[[H4994|Please]] [[H3947|take]] [[H1293|my present]] [[H834|that]] [[H935|was brought to you,]] [[H3588|because]] [[H430|God]] [[H2603|has been gracious]] [[H3426|to me  and I have]] [[H3605|all I need.]] [[H6484|So Jacob pressed]] [[H3947|him  until he accepted.]] ^3311

[[H559|Then Esau said,]] [[H5265|“Let us be on our way,]] [[H1980|and I will go]] [[H5048|ahead of you.”]] ^3312

[[H559|But Jacob replied,]] [[H113|“My lord]] [[H3045|knows]] [[H3588|that]] [[H3206|the children]] [[H7390|are frail,]] [[H5921|and I must care for]] [[H6629|sheep]] [[H1241|and cattle]] [[H5763|that are nursing their young.]] [[H1849|If they are driven hard]] [[H259|for even a]] [[H3117|day,]] [[H3605|all]] [[H6629|the animals]] [[H4191|will die.]] ^3313

[[H4994|Please]] [[H113|let my lord]] [[H5674|go]] [[H6440|ahead of]] [[H5650|his servant.]] [[H589|I]] [[H5095|will continue]] [[H328|on slowly,]] [[H7272|at a comfortable pace]] [[H4399|for the livestock]] [[H3206|and children,]] [[H5704|until]] [[H935|I come]] [[H413|to]] [[H113|my lord]] [[H8165|at Seir.”]] ^3314

[[H3322|“Let me leave]] [[H4480|some of]] [[H834|my]] [[H5971|people]] [[H5973|with you,”]] [[H6215|Esau]] [[H559|said.]] [[H559|But replied,]] ⟨Jacob⟩ [[H4100|“Why]] [[H2088|do that?]] [[H4672|Let me find]] [[H2580|favor]] [[H5869|in the sight]] [[H113|of my lord.”]] ^3315

[[H1931|So that]] [[H3117|day]] [[H6215|Esau]] [[H1870|started on his way]] [[H7725|back]] [[H8165|to Seir,]] ^3316

[[H3290|but Jacob]] [[H5265|went on]] [[H5523|to Succoth,]] [[H1129|where he built]] [[H1004|a house]] [[H5521|for himself  and shelters]] [[H4735|for his livestock;]] [[H5921|that is why]] [[H4725|the place]] [[H7121|was called]] [[H5523|Succoth.]] ^3317

[[H3290|After Jacob]] [[H935|had come]] [[H6307|from  Paddan-aram,]] [[H935|he arrived]] [[H8003|safely]] [[H5892|at the city]] [[H7927|of Shechem]] [[H776|in the land]] [[H3667|of Canaan,]] [[H2583|and he camped]] [[H6440|just outside]] [[H5892|the city.]] ^3318

[[H2513|And the plot]] [[H7704|of ground]] [[H834|where]] [[H5186|he pitched]] [[H168|his tent,]] [[H7069|he purchased]] [[H3027|from]] [[H1121|the sons]] [[H2544|of Hamor,]] [[H7927|Shechem’s]] [[H1|father,]] [[H3967|for a hundred]] [[H7192|pieces of silver.]] ^3319

[[H8033|There]] [[H5324|he set up]] [[H4196|an altar]] [[H7121|and called it]] [[H410|El-Elohe-Israel.]] ^3320

[[H1783|Now Dinah,]] [[H1323|the daughter]] [[H3812|Leah]] [[H3205|had borne]] [[H3290|to Jacob,]] [[H3318|went out]] [[H7200|to visit]] [[H1323|the daughters]] [[H776|of the land.]] ^3401

[[H7927|When Shechem]] [[H1121|son]] [[H2544|of Hamor]] [[H2340|the Hivite,]] [[H5387|the prince]] [[H776|of the region,]] [[H7200|saw her,]] [[H3947|he took]] [[H853|her]] [[H7901|and lay]] [[H854|with her]] [[H6031|by force.]] ^3402

[[H5315|And his soul]] [[H1692|was drawn]] [[H1783|to Dinah,]] [[H1323|the daughter]] [[H3290|of Jacob.]] [[H157|He loved]] [[H5291|the young girl]] [[H1696|and spoke to her tenderly.]] ^3403

[[H7927|So Shechem]] [[H559|told]] [[H1|his father]] [[H2544|Hamor,]] [[H3947|“Get]] [[H2063|me this]] [[H3207|girl]] [[H802|as a wife.”]] ^3404

[[H3290|Jacob]] [[H8085|heard]] [[H3588|that]] [[H2930|Shechem had defiled]] [[H1323|his daughter]] [[H1783|Dinah,]] [[H1121|but since his sons]] [[H1961|were]] [[H854|with]] [[H4735|his livestock]] [[H7704|in the field,]] [[H3290|he]] [[H2790|held his peace]] [[H5704|until]] [[H935|they returned.]] ^3405

[[H7927|Meanwhile, Shechem’s]] [[H1|father]] [[H2544|Hamor]] [[H3318|came]] [[H1696|to speak]] [[H854|with]] [[H3290|Jacob.]] ^3406

[[H3290|When Jacob’s]] [[H1121|sons]] [[H8085|heard what had happened,]] [[H935|they returned]] [[H4480|from]] [[H7704|the field.]] [[H3966|They were filled with]] [[H6087|grief]] [[H2734|and fury,]] [[H3588|because]] [[H6213|Shechem had committed]] [[H5039|an outrage]] [[H3478|in Israel]] [[H7901|by lying]] [[H854|with]] [[H3290|Jacob’s]] [[H1323|daughter—]] [[H3651|a thing]] [[H3808|that should not]] [[H6213|be done.]] ^3407

[[H2544|But Hamor]] [[H1696|said]] [[H854|to them,]] [[H1121|“My son]] [[H7927|Shechem]] [[H2836|longs for]] [[H1323|your daughter.]] [[H4994|Please]] [[H5414|give]] [[H853|her]] [[H802|to him  as his wife.]] ^3408

[[H2859|Intermarry with us;]] [[H5414|give]] [[H1323|us  your daughters,]] [[H3947|and take]] [[H1323|our daughters]] ^3409

[[H3427|You may settle]] [[H854|among us,]] [[H776|and the land]] ⟨will⟩ [[H1961|be]] [[H6440|open to you.]] [[H3427|Live here,]] [[H5503|move about freely,]] [[H270|and acquire your own property.”]] ^3410

[[H7927|Then Shechem]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H1|Dinah’s father]] [[H251|and brothers,]] [[H4672|“Grant me this favor,]] [[H5414|and I will give]] [[H834|you whatever]] [[H559|you ask.]] ^3411

[[H7235|Demand]] [[H5921|a high]] [[H4119|dowry]] [[H4976|and gift,]] ⟨an expensive⟩ [[H5414|and I will give you]] [[H834|whatever]] [[H559|you ask.]] [[H5414|Only give]] [[H5291|me  the girl]] [[H802|as my wife!”]] ^3412

[[H834|But because]] ⟨Shechem⟩ [[H2930|had defiled]] [[H269|their sister]] [[H1783|Dinah,]] [[H3290|Jacob’s]] [[H1121|sons]] [[H6030|answered]] ⟨him⟩ [[H7927|]] [[H1|and his father]] [[H2544|Hamor]] [[H4820|deceitfully.]] ^3413

[[H3808|“We cannot]] [[H6213|do]] [[H2088|such]] [[H1697|a thing,”]] [[H559|they said.]] [[H5414|“To give]] [[H269|our sister]] [[H6190|to  an uncircumcised man]] [[H2781|would be a disgrace]] ^3414

[[H225|We will consent]] [[H389|to this  on one]] [[H518|condition,]] [[H1961|that you become]] [[H4135|circumcised]] [[H3644|like us—]] [[H3605|every one of]] [[H2145|your males.]] ^3415

[[H5414|Then we will give]] [[H1323|you  our daughters]] [[H853|and]] [[H3947|take]] [[H1323|your daughters]] [[H3427|for ourselves.  We will dwell]] [[H854|among you]] [[H1961|and become]] [[H259|one]] [[H5971|people.]] ^3416

[[H518|But if]] [[H3808|you will not]] [[H8085|agree]] [[H4135|to be circumcised,]] [[H3947|then we will take]] [[H1323|our sister]] [[H1980|and go.”]] ^3417

[[H1697|Their offer]] [[H3190|seemed good]] [[H2544|to Hamor]] [[H2544|and his]] [[H1121|son]] [[H7927|Shechem.]] ^3418

[[H5288|The young man,]] [[H1931|who]] ⟨was⟩ [[H3513|the most respected]] [[H3605|of all]] [[H1|his father’s]] [[H1004|household,]] [[H3808|did not]] [[H309|hesitate]] [[H6213|to fulfill]] [[H1697|this request,]] [[H3588|because]] [[H2654|he was delighted]] [[H3290|with Jacob’s]] [[H1323|daughter.]] ^3419

[[H2544|So Hamor]] [[H1121|and his son]] [[H7927|Shechem]] [[H935|went]] [[H413|to]] [[H8179|the gate]] [[H5892|of their city]] [[H1696|and addressed]] [[H582|the men]] [[H5892|of their city:]] ^3420

[[H428|“These]] [[H376|men]] [[H8003|are at peace]] [[H854|with us.]] [[H3427|Let them live]] [[H5503|and trade]] [[H776|in our land;]] [[H2009|indeed,]] ⟨it⟩ [[H776|]] [[H7342|is large]] [[H6440|enough for them.]] [[H3947|Let us take]] [[H1323|their daughters]] [[H802|in marriage]] [[H5414|and give]] [[H1323|our daughters to them.]] ^3421

[[H389|But only]] [[H2063|on this condition]] ⟨will⟩ [[H376|the men]] [[H225|agree]] [[H3427|to dwell]] [[H854|with us]] [[H1961|and be]] [[H259|one]] [[H5971|people:]] [[H3605|if all]] [[H2145|our men]] [[H4135|are circumcised]] [[H834|as]] [[H1992|they are.]] ^3422

[[H3808|Will not]] [[H4735|their livestock,]] [[H7075|their possessions,]] [[H3605|and all]] [[H1992|their]] [[H929|animals]] ⟨become ours⟩? [[H389|Only]] [[H225|let us consent]] [[H3427|to them,  and they will dwell]] [[H854|among us.”]] ^3423

[[H3605|All the men]] [[H3318|who went out]] [[H5892|of the city]] [[H8179|gate]] [[H8085|listened]] [[H413|to]] [[H2544|Hamor]] [[H1121|and his son]] [[H7927|Shechem,]] [[H3605|and every]] [[H2145|male]] [[H5892|of the city]] [[H4135|was circumcised.]] ^3424

[[H7992|Three]] [[H3117|days later,]] [[H1961|while]] [[H1961|they were]] [[H3510|still in pain,]] [[H8147|two]] [[H3290|of Jacob’s]] [[H1121|sons]] [[H1783|(Dinah’s]] [[H251|brothers]] [[H8095|Simeon]] [[H3878|and Levi)]] [[H3947|took]] [[H2719|their swords,]] [[H935|went]] [[H5921|into]] [[H983|the unsuspecting]] [[H5892|city,]] [[H2026|and slaughtered]] [[H3605|every]] [[H2145|male.]] ^3425

[[H2026|They killed]] [[H2544|Hamor]] [[H1121|and his son]] [[H7927|Shechem]] [[H2719|with their swords,]] [[H3947|took]] [[H1783|Dinah]] [[H7927|out of Shechem’s]] [[H1004|house,]] [[H3318|and went away.]] ^3426

[[H3290|Jacob’s]] [[H1121|other sons]] [[H935|came]] [[H5921|upon]] [[H2491|the slaughter]] [[H962|and looted]] [[H5892|the city,]] [[H834|because]] [[H269|their sister]] [[H2930|had been defiled.]] ^3427

[[H3947|They took]] [[H6629|their flocks]] [[H853|and]] [[H1241|herds]] [[H853|and]] [[H2543|donkeys,]] [[H834|and everything else]] [[H5892|in the city]] [[H7704|or in the field.]] ^3428

[[H7617|They carried off]] [[H3605|all]] [[H2428|their possessions]] [[H853|and]] [[H802|women]] [[H853|and]] [[H2945|children,]] [[H962|and they plundered]] [[H3605|everything]] [[H1004|in houses.]] ⟨their⟩ ^3429

[[H3290|Then Jacob]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H8095|Simeon]] [[H3878|and Levi,]] [[H5916|“You have brought trouble]] [[H853|upon me]] [[H887|by making me repugnant]] [[H3669|to the Canaanites]] [[H6522|and Perizzites,]] [[H3427|the people]] [[H776|of this land.]] [[H589|We]] [[H4962|are few]] [[H4557|in number;]] [[H622|if they unite]] [[H5921|against me]] [[H5221|and attack me,]] [[H589|I]] [[H1004|and my household]] [[H8045|will be destroyed.]] ^3430

[[H559|But answered,]] ⟨Simeon and Levi⟩ [[H6213|“Should he have treated]] [[H269|our sister]] [[H2181|like a prostitute?”]] ^3431

[[H430|Then God]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H3290|Jacob,]] [[H6965|“Arise,]] [[H5927|go up]] [[H1008|to  Bethel,]] [[H3427|and settle]] [[H8033|there.]] [[H6213|Build]] [[H4196|an altar]] [[H8033|there]] [[H410|to the God]] [[H7200|who appeared]] [[H413|to]] [[H1272|you when you fled]] [[H6440|from]] [[H251|your brother]] [[H6215|Esau.”]] ^3501

[[H3290|So Jacob]] [[H559|told]] [[H1004|his household]] [[H3605|and all]] [[H834|who]] [[H5973|were with him,]] [[H5493|“Get rid of]] [[H5236|the foreign]] [[H430|gods]] [[H834|that]] [[H8432|are among you.]] [[H2891|Purify yourselves]] [[H2498|and change]] [[H8071|your garments.]] ^3502

[[H6965|Then let us arise]] [[H5927|and go]] [[H1008|to  Bethel.]] [[H6213|I will build]] [[H4196|an altar]] [[H8033|there]] [[H410|to the God]] [[H6030|who answered]] [[H3117|me in my day]] [[H6869|of distress.]] [[H1961|He has been]] [[H5978|with me]] [[H1870|wherever]] [[H1980|I have gone.”]] ^3503

[[H5414|So they gave]] [[H3290|Jacob]] [[H3605|all]] [[H834|their]] [[H5236|foreign]] [[H430|gods]] [[H5141|and earrings,]] ⟨all their⟩ [[H3290|and Jacob]] [[H2934|buried]] [[H8478|them under]] [[H424|the oak]] [[H5973|near]] [[H7927|Shechem.]] ^3504

[[H5265|As they set out,]] [[H2847|a terror]] [[H430|from God]] [[H1961|fell]] [[H5921|over]] [[H5439|the surrounding]] [[H5892|cities,]] [[H3808|so that they did not]] [[H7291|pursue]] [[H3290|Jacob’s]] [[H1121|sons.]] ^3505

[[H3290|So Jacob]] [[H3605|and everyone]] [[H5973|with him]] [[H935|arrived]] [[H3870|in Luz]] [[H1931|(that is,]] [[H1008|Bethel)]] [[H776|in the land]] [[H3667|of Canaan.]] ^3506

[[H8033|There]] [[H1129|Jacob built]] [[H4196|an altar,]] [[H7121|and he called]] [[H4725|that place]] [[H410|El-bethel,]] [[H3588|because]] [[H8033|it was there]] [[H430|that God]] [[H1540|had revealed Himself]] [[H413|to him]] [[H1272|as he fled]] [[H6440|from]] [[H251|his brother.]] ^3507

[[H1683|Now Deborah,]] [[H7259|Rebekah’s]] [[H3243|nurse,]] [[H4191|died]] [[H6912|and was buried]] [[H8478|under]] [[H437|the oak]] [[H8478|below]] [[H1008|Bethel.]] [[H7121|So named]] ⟨Jacob⟩ ⟨it⟩ [[H8034|]] [[H439|Allon-bachuth.]] ^3508

[[H935|After had returned]] ⟨Jacob⟩ [[H6307|from  Paddan-aram,]] [[H430|God]] [[H7200|appeared]] [[H413|to]] ⟨him⟩ [[H3290|]] [[H5750|again]] [[H1288|and blessed]] [[H853|him.]] ^3509

[[H430|And God]] [[H559|said]] [[H8034|to him,  “Your name]] [[H3290|is Jacob;]] [[H3808|you will no]] [[H5750|longer]] [[H7121|be called]] [[H3290|Jacob,]] [[H3588|but]] [[H8034|your name]] [[H1961|will be]] [[H3478|Israel.”]] [[H7121|So named]] ⟨God⟩ [[H3478|him Israel.]] ^3510

[[H776|The land]] [[H834|that]] [[H5414|I gave]] [[H85|to Abraham]] [[H3327|and Isaac]] [[H5414|I will give]] [[H5414|to you,  and I will give]] [[H776|this land]] [[H2233|to your descendants]] [[H310|after you.”]] ^3512

[[H430|Then God]] [[H5927|went up]] [[H5921|from him]] [[H4725|at the place]] [[H834|where]] [[H1696|He had spoken]] [[H854|with him.]] ^3513

[[H559|Then told him,]] ⟨Israel⟩ [[H1980|“Go]] [[H4994|now]] [[H7200|and see]] [[H251|how your brothers]] [[H6629|and the flocks]] [[H7965|are faring,]] [[H1697|and bring word]] [[H7725|back to me.”]] [[H7971|So he sent him off]] [[H6010|from the Valley]] [[H2275|of Hebron.]] [[H935|And when arrived]] ⟨Joseph⟩ [[H7927|in Shechem,]] ^3714

[[H582|a man]] [[H4672|found him]] [[H8582|wandering]] [[H7704|in the field]] [[H7592|and asked,]] [[H4100|“What]] [[H1245|are you looking for?”]] ^3715

[[H595|“I am]] [[H1245|looking for]] [[H251|my brothers,”]] [[H559|Joseph replied.]] [[H5046|“Can you please tell me]] [[H375|where]] [[H1992|they]] [[H7462|are pasturing their flocks?”]] ^3716

[[H5265|“They have moved on]] [[H2088|from here,”]] [[H376|the man]] [[H559|answered.]] [[H8085|“I heard]] [[H559|them say,]] [[H1980|‘Let us go]] [[H1886|to Dothan.’”]] [[H3130|So Joseph]] [[H1980|set out]] [[H310|after]] [[H251|his brothers]] [[H4672|and found them]] [[H1886|at Dothan.]] ^3717

[[H7200|Now saw]] ⟨Joseph’s brothers⟩ [[H853|him]] [[H7350|in the distance,]] [[H2962|and before]] [[H7126|he arrived,]] [[H5230|they plotted]] [[H4191|to kill him.]] ^3718

[[H2009|“Here]] [[H935|comes]] [[H1976|that]] [[H1167|dreamer!”]] [[H559|they said]] [[H413|to]] [[H376|one]] [[H251|another.]] ^3719

[[H1980|“Come]] [[H6258|now,]] [[H2026|let us kill]] [[H7993|him and throw]] [[H259|him into one]] [[H953|of the pits.]] [[H559|We can say]] [[H7451|that a vicious]] [[H2416|animal]] [[H398|has devoured him.]] [[H7200|Then we shall see]] [[H4100|what]] [[H1961|becomes]] [[H2472|of his dreams!”]] ^3720

[[H7205|When Reuben]] [[H8085|heard]] ⟨this⟩, [[H5337|he tried to rescue]] ⟨Joseph⟩ [[H3027|from their hands.]] [[H3808|“Let us not]] [[H5221|take]] [[H5315|his life,”]] [[H559|he said.]] ^3721

[[H8210|“Do not shed]] ⟨his⟩ [[H1818|blood.]] [[H7993|Throw]] [[H413|him into]] [[H2088|this]] [[H953|pit]] [[H4057|in the wilderness,]] [[H408|but do not]] [[H7971|lay]] [[H3027|a hand]] [[H7205|on him.”  Reuben]] [[H559|said this]] [[H4616|so that]] [[H5337|he could rescue]] ⟨Joseph⟩ [[H853|]] [[H3027|from their hands]] [[H7725|and return]] [[H413|him to]] [[H1|his father.]] ^3722

[[H1961|So]] [[H834|when]] [[H3130|Joseph]] [[H935|came]] [[H413|to]] [[H251|his brothers,]] [[H6584|they stripped]] ⟨him⟩ [[H3130|]] [[H3801|of his robe—]] [[H3801|the robe]] [[H6446|of many colors]] [[H5921|he was wearing—]] ^3723

[[H3947|and they took]] [[H7993|him and threw]] [[H953|him into the pit.]] [[H953|Now the pit]] [[H7386|was empty,]] [[H369|with no]] [[H4325|water]] ^3724

[[H3427|And as they sat down]] [[H398|to eat]] [[H3899|a meal,]] [[H5375|they looked up]] [[H2009|and saw]] [[H736|a caravan]] [[H3459|of Ishmaelites]] [[H935|coming]] [[H1568|from Gilead.]] [[H1581|Their camels]] [[H5375|were carrying]] [[H5219|spices,]] [[H6875|balm,]] [[H3910|and myrrh]] [[H1980|on their way]] [[H3381|down]] [[H4714|to Egypt.]] ^3725

[[H3063|Then Judah]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H251|his brothers,]] [[H4100|“What]] [[H1215|profit will we gain]] [[H3588|if]] [[H2026|we kill]] [[H251|our brother]] [[H3680|and cover up]] [[H1818|his blood?]] ^3726

[[H1980|Come,]] [[H4376|let us sell]] [[H3459|him to the Ishmaelites]] [[H408|and not]] [[H1961|lay]] [[H3027|a hand on him;]] [[H3588|for]] [[H1931|he]] [[H251|is our brother,]] [[H1320|our own flesh.”]] [[H251|And they]] [[H8085|agreed.]] ^3727

[[H4084|So when the Midianite]] [[H5503|traders]] [[H5674|passed by,]] [[H4900|his brothers pulled]] [[H3130|Joseph]] [[H4480|out of]] [[H953|the pit]] [[H4376|and sold]] [[H3130|him]] [[H6242|for twenty]] ⟨shekels⟩ [[H3701|of silver]] [[H3459|to the Ishmaelites,]] [[H935|who took]] ⟨him⟩ [[H3130|]] [[H4714|to Egypt.]] ^3728

[[H7205|When Reuben]] [[H7725|returned]] [[H413|to]] [[H953|the pit]] [[H2009|and saw]] [[H3130|that Joseph]] [[H369|was not there,]] [[H7167|he tore]] [[H899|his clothes,]] ^3729

[[H7725|returned]] [[H413|to]] [[H251|his brothers,]] [[H559|and said,]] [[H3206|“The boy]] [[H369|is gone!]] [[H589|What am I going to do?”]] ^3730

[[H3947|Then they took]] [[H3130|Joseph’s]] [[H3801|robe,]] [[H7819|slaughtered]] [[H8163|a young goat,]] [[H2881|and dipped]] [[H3801|the robe]] [[H1818|in its blood.]] ^3731

[[H7971|They sent]] [[H3801|the robe]] [[H6446|of many colors]] [[H413|to]] [[H1|their father]] [[H559|and said,]] [[H4672|“We found]] [[H2063|this.]] [[H5234|Examine it]] [[H4994|to see whether]] [[H1931|it]] ⟨is⟩ [[H1121|your son’s]] [[H3801|robe]] [[H518|or]] [[H3808|not.”]] ^3732

[[H5234|His father recognized it]] [[H559|and said,]] [[H1121|“It is my son’s]] [[H3801|robe!]] [[H7451|A vicious]] [[H2416|animal]] [[H398|has devoured him.]] [[H3130|Joseph]] [[H2963|has surely been torn to pieces!”]] ^3733

[[H3290|Then Jacob]] [[H7167|tore]] [[H8071|his clothes,]] [[H7760|put]] [[H8242|sackcloth]] [[H4975|around his waist,]] [[H56|and mourned]] [[H5921|for]] [[H1121|his son]] [[H7227|many]] [[H3117|days.]] ^3734

[[H3605|All]] [[H1121|his sons]] [[H1323|and daughters]] [[H5162|tried to comfort him,]] [[H3985|but he refused]] [[H5162|to be comforted.]] [[H559|“No,” he said.]] [[H3381|“I will go down]] [[H7585|to Sheol]] [[H57|mourning]] [[H413|for]] [[H1121|my son.”]] [[H1|So his father]] [[H1058|wept]] [[H853|for him.]] ^3735

[[H4084|Meanwhile, the Midianites]] [[H4376|sold]] ⟨Joseph⟩ [[H853|]] [[H413|in]] [[H4714|Egypt]] [[H6318|to Potiphar,]] [[H5631|an officer]] [[H6547|of Pharaoh]] ⟨and⟩ [[H8269|captain]] [[H2876|of the guard.]] ^3736

[[H1961|About]] [[H1931|that]] [[H6256|time,]] [[H3063|Judah]] [[H3381|left]] [[H251|his brothers]] [[H5186|and settled]] [[H5704|near]] [[H376|a man]] [[H8034|named]] [[H2437|Hirah,]] [[H5726|an Adullamite.]] ^3801

[[H8033|There]] [[H3063|Judah]] [[H7200|saw]] [[H1323|the daughter]] [[H3669|of a Canaanite]] [[H376|man]] [[H8034|named]] [[H7770|Shua,]] [[H3947|and he took her as a wife]] [[H935|and slept with]] [[H413|her.]] ^3802

[[H2029|So she conceived]] [[H3205|and gave birth to]] [[H1121|a son,]] [[H7121|and named]] ⟨Judah⟩ [[H6147|him Er.]] ^3803

[[H5750|Again]] [[H2029|she conceived]] [[H3205|and gave birth to]] [[H1121|a son,]] [[H7121|and she named]] [[H8034|him]] [[H209|Onan.]] ^3804

[[H3205|Then she gave birth to]] [[H3254|another]] [[H1121|son]] [[H7121|and named]] [[H7956|him Shelah;]] [[H1961|it was]] [[H3580|at Chezib]] [[H3205|that she gave birth to him.]] ^3805

[[H3063|Now Judah]] [[H3947|acquired]] [[H802|a wife]] [[H6147|for Er,]] [[H1060|his firstborn,]] [[H8034|and her name]] [[H8559|was Tamar.]] ^3806

[[H1961|But]] [[H6147|Er,]] [[H3063|Judah’s]] [[H1060|firstborn,]] [[H7451|was wicked]] [[H3068|in the LORD’s]] [[H5869|sight;]] [[H3068|so the LORD]] [[H4191|put him to death.]] ^3807

[[H3063|Then Judah]] [[H559|said]] [[H209|to Onan,]] [[H935|“Sleep with]] [[H251|your brother’s]] [[H802|wife.]] [[H2992|Perform your duty as her brother-in-law]] [[H6965|and raise up]] [[H2233|offspring]] [[H251|for your brother.”]] ^3808

[[H209|But Onan]] [[H3045|knew]] [[H3588|that]] [[H2233|the offspring]] [[H3808|would not]] [[H1961|belong]] [[H518|to him;  so whenever]] [[H935|he would sleep with]] [[H251|his brother’s]] [[H802|wife,]] [[H7843|he would spill his seed]] [[H776|on the ground]] [[H1115|so that he would not]] [[H5414|produce]] [[H2233|offspring]] [[H251|for his brother.]] ^3809

[[H834|What]] [[H6213|he did]] [[H7489|was evil]] [[H3068|in the LORD’s]] [[H5869|sight,]] [[H4191|so He put to death]] ⟨Onan⟩ [[H1571|as well.]] ^3810

[[H3063|Then Judah]] [[H559|said]] [[H3618|to his daughter-in-law]] [[H8559|Tamar,]] [[H3427|“Live]] [[H490|as a widow]] [[H1|in your father’s]] [[H1004|house]] [[H5704|until]] [[H1121|my son]] [[H7956|Shelah]] [[H1431|grows up.”]] [[H3588|For]] [[H559|he thought,]] [[H1931|“He]] [[H6435|may]] [[H4191|die]] [[H1571|too,]] [[H251|like his brothers.”]] [[H8559|So Tamar]] [[H1980|went]] [[H3427|to live]] [[H1|in her father’s]] [[H1004|house.]] ^3811

[[H7235|After a long]] [[H3117|time]] [[H3063|Judah’s]] [[H802|wife,]] [[H1323|the daughter]] [[H7770|of Shua,]] [[H4191|died.]] [[H3063|When Judah]] [[H5162|had finished mourning,]] [[H1931|he]] [[H7453|and his friend]] [[H2437|Hirah]] [[H5726|the Adullamite]] [[H5927|went up]] [[H5921|to]] [[H1494|his sheepshearers]] [[H8553|at Timnah.]] ^3812

[[H8559|When Tamar]] [[H5046|was told,]] [[H2524|“Your father-in-law]] [[H5927|is going up]] [[H8553|to Timnah]] [[H1494|to shear]] [[H6629|his sheep,”]] ^3813

[[H5493|she removed]] [[H491|her widow’s]] [[H899|garments,]] [[H5968|covered her face]] [[H6809|with a veil]] [[H3680|to disguise herself,]] [[H3427|and sat]] [[H6607|at the entrance]] [[H5869|to Enaim,]] [[H834|which]] [[H5921|is on]] [[H1870|the way]] [[H8553|to Timnah.]] [[H3588|For]] [[H7200|she saw]] [[H3588|that]] [[H7956|although Shelah]] [[H1431|had grown up,]] [[H1931|she]] [[H3808|had not]] [[H5414|been given]] [[H802|to him  as a wife.]] ^3814

[[H3063|When Judah]] [[H7200|saw her,]] [[H2803|he thought]] [[H2181|she was a prostitute]] [[H3588|because]] [[H3680|she had covered]] [[H6440|her face.]] ^3815

[[H3808|Not]] [[H3045|realizing]] [[H3588|that]] [[H1931|she]] [[H3618|was his daughter-in-law,]] [[H5186|he went over]] [[H413|to]] [[H559|her and said,]] [[H3051|“Come]] [[H4994|now,]] [[H935|let me sleep with]] [[H413|you.”]] [[H4100|“What]] [[H5414|will you give]] [[H3588|me for]] [[H935|sleeping with]] [[H413|you?”]] [[H559|she asked.]] ^3816

[[H595|“I]] [[H7971|will send you]] [[H1423|a young goat]] [[H4480|from]] [[H6629|my flock,”]] ⟨Judah⟩ [[H559|answered.]] [[H559|But she replied,]] [[H518|“Only if]] [[H5414|you leave me]] [[H6162|something as a pledge]] [[H5704|until]] [[H7971|you send it.”]] ^3817

[[H4100|“What]] [[H6162|pledge]] [[H5414|should I give you?”]] [[H559|he asked.]] [[H559|She answered,]] [[H2368|“Your seal]] [[H6616|and your cord,]] [[H4294|and the staff]] [[H3027|in your hand.”]] [[H5414|So he gave]] [[H935|them to her  and slept with]] [[H413|her,]] [[H2029|and she became pregnant]] ^3818

[[H6965|After she got up]] [[H1980|and left,]] [[H5493|she removed]] [[H6809|her veil]] [[H491|and put on her widow’s]] [[H899|garments]] [[H3847|again.]] ^3819

[[H3063|Now when Judah]] [[H7971|sent]] [[H7453|his friend]] ⟨Hirah⟩ [[H5726|the Adullamite]] [[H3027|with]] [[H1423|the young goat]] [[H3947|to collect]] [[H6162|the items he had left with]] [[H802|the woman,]] [[H3808|he could not]] [[H4672|find her.]] ^3820

[[H7592|He asked]] [[H582|the men]] [[H4725|of that place,]] [[H346|“Where]] [[H6948|is the temple prostitute]] [[H1931|who]] [[H5921|was beside]] [[H1870|the road]] [[H5879|at Enaim?”]] [[H3808|“No]] [[H6948|temple prostitute]] [[H1961|has been]] [[H2088|here,”]] [[H559|they answered.]] ^3821

[[H7725|So returned]] ⟨Hirah⟩ [[H413|to]] [[H3063|Judah]] [[H559|and said,]] [[H3808|“I could not]] [[H4672|find her,]] [[H1571|and furthermore,]] [[H376|the men]] [[H4725|of that place]] [[H559|said,]] [[H3808|‘No]] [[H6948|temple prostitute]] [[H1961|has been]] [[H2088|here.’”]] ^3822

[[H3947|“Let her  keep the items,”]] [[H3063|Judah]] [[H559|replied.]] [[H6435|“Otherwise]] [[H1961|we will become]] [[H937|a laughingstock.]] [[H2009|After all,]] [[H7971|I did send her]] [[H2088|this]] [[H1423|young goat,]] [[H859|but you]] [[H3808|could not]] [[H4672|find her.”]] ^3823

[[H1961|About]] [[H7969|three]] [[H2320|months later,]] [[H3063|Judah]] [[H5046|was told,]] [[H3618|“Your daughter-in-law]] [[H8559|Tamar]] [[H2181|has prostituted herself,]] [[H1571|and]] [[H2009|now]] [[H2030|she is pregnant.”]] [[H3318|“Bring her out!”]] [[H3063|Judah]] [[H559|replied.]] [[H8313|“Let her be burned to death!”]] ^3824

[[H1931|As she]] [[H3318|was being brought out,]] [[H1931|she]] [[H7971|sent]] [[H559|a message]] [[H413|to her]] [[H2524|father-in-law:]] [[H595|“I am]] [[H2030|pregnant]] [[H834|by the man to whom]] [[H428|these items]] [[H559|belong.”  And she added,]] [[H4994|“Please]] [[H5234|examine them.]] [[H4310|Whose]] [[H2858|seal]] [[H6616|and cord]] [[H4294|and staff]] [[H428|are these?”]] ^3825

[[H3063|Judah]] [[H5234|recognized]] ⟨the items⟩ [[H559|and said,]] [[H6663|“She is more righteous]] [[H4480|than I,]] [[H3588|since]] [[H3808|I did not]] [[H5414|give]] [[H1121|her to my son]] [[H7956|Shelah.”]] [[H3808|And he did not]] [[H3045|have relations with her]] [[H3254|again.]] ^3826

[[H6256|When the time]] [[H1961|came]] [[H3205|for to give birth,]] ⟨Tamar⟩ [[H2009|there]] [[H8380|were twins]] [[H990|in her womb.]] ^3827

[[H1961|And]] [[H3205|as she was giving birth,]] [[H5414|one of them put out]] [[H3027|his hand;]] [[H3205|so the midwife]] [[H3947|took]] [[H8144|a scarlet thread]] [[H7194|and tied]] ⟨it⟩ [[H5921|around]] [[H3027|his wrist.]] [[H2088|“This]] [[H3318|one came out]] [[H7223|first,”]] [[H559|she announced.]] ^3828

[[H3027|But when he pulled his hand]] [[H7725|back]] [[H251|and his brother]] [[H3318|came out,]] [[H559|she said,]] [[H6555|“You have broken out first!”]] [[H7121|So he was named]] [[H6557|Perez.]] ^3829

[[H310|Then]] [[H251|his brother]] [[H3318|came out]] [[H834|with]] [[H8144|the scarlet thread]] [[H5921|around]] [[H3027|his wrist,]] [[H7121|and he was named]] [[H2226|Zerah.]] ^3830

[[H3130|Meanwhile, Joseph]] [[H3381|had been taken down]] [[H4714|to Egypt,]] [[H4713|where an Egyptian]] [[H6318|named Potiphar,]] [[H5631|an officer]] [[H6547|of Pharaoh]] [[H8269|and captain]] [[H2876|of the guard,]] [[H7069|bought]] [[H3027|him from]] [[H3459|the Ishmaelites]] [[H834|who]] [[H3381|had taken]] [[H8033|him there.]] ^3901

[[H3068|And the LORD]] [[H1961|was]] [[H854|with]] [[H3130|Joseph,]] [[H1961|and he became]] [[H6743|a successful]] [[H582|man,]] [[H1961|serving]] [[H1004|in the household]] [[H4713|of his Egyptian]] [[H113|master.]] ^3902

[[H113|When his master]] [[H7200|saw]] [[H3588|that]] [[H3068|the LORD]] ⟨was⟩ [[H854|with him]] ⟨and⟩ [[H3068|]] [[H6743|made him prosper]] [[H3605|in all]] [[H1931|he]] [[H6213|did,]] ^3903

[[H3130|Joseph]] [[H4672|found]] [[H2580|favor]] [[H5869|in his sight]] [[H8334|and became his personal attendant.]] [[H6485|Potiphar put]] [[H5921|him in charge of]] [[H1004|his household]] [[H5414|and entrusted]] [[H3027|him]] [[H3605|with everything]] [[H3426|he owned.]] ^3904

[[H227|From the time]] [[H6485|that he put in charge]] ⟨Joseph⟩ [[H1004|of his household]] [[H5921|and]] [[H3605|all]] [[H3426|he owned,]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H1288|blessed]] [[H4713|the Egyptian’s]] [[H1004|household]] [[H1558|on account of]] ⟨him⟩ [[H3130|.]] [[H3068|The LORD’s]] [[H1293|blessing]] [[H1961|was]] [[H3605|on everything]] [[H3426|he owned,]] [[H1004|both in his house]] [[H7704|and in his field.]] ^3905

[[H5800|So left]] ⟨Potiphar⟩ [[H3605|all]] [[H834|that]] [[H3130|he owned  in Joseph’s]] [[H3027|care;]] [[H3808|he did not]] [[H3045|concern]] [[H3972|himself with anything]] [[H3588|except]] [[H3899|the food]] [[H1931|he]] [[H398|ate.]] [[H3130|Now Joseph]] [[H1961|was]] [[H3303|well-built]] [[H3303|and handsome,]] ^3906

[[H1961|and]] [[H310|after some time]] [[H113|his master’s]] [[H802|wife]] [[H5375|cast]] [[H5869|her eyes]] [[H413|on]] [[H3130|Joseph]] [[H559|and said,]] [[H7901|“Sleep]] [[H5973|with me.”]] ^3907

[[H3985|But he refused.]] [[H2005|“Look,”]] [[H559|he said]] [[H413|to]] [[H113|his master’s]] [[H802|wife,]] [[H854|“with me here,]] [[H113|my master]] [[H3808|does not]] [[H3045|concern himself]] [[H4100|with anything]] [[H1004|in his house,]] [[H5414|and he has entrusted]] [[H3605|everything]] [[H3426|he owns]] [[H3027|to  my care.]] ^3908

[[H369|No]] [[H2088|one in this]] [[H1004|house]] [[H1419|is greater]] [[H4480|than I am.]] [[H2820|He has withheld]] [[H3808|nothing]] [[H4480|from]] [[H3588|me except]] [[H518|you,]] [[H834|because]] [[H859|you]] [[H802|are his wife.]] [[H349|So how]] [[H6213|could I do]] [[H2063|such]] [[H1419|a great]] [[H7451|evil]] [[H2398|and sin]] [[H430|against God?”]] ^3909

[[H1961|Although]] ⟨Potiphar’s wife⟩ [[H1696|spoke]] [[H413|to]] [[H3130|Joseph]] [[H3117|day]] [[H3117|after day,]] [[H3808|he refused]] [[H7901|to go to bed]] [[H681|with her]] ⟨or⟩ [[H1961|be]] [[H5973|with her.]] ^3910

[[H3117|One day,]] [[H1961|however,]] ⟨Joseph⟩ [[H935|went]] [[H1004|into the house]] [[H6213|to attend to]] [[H4399|his work,]] [[H369|and not]] [[H376|a single]] [[H1004|household]] [[H376|servant]] ⟨was⟩ [[H8033|]] [[H1004|inside.]] ^3911

[[H8610|She grabbed]] ⟨Joseph⟩ [[H899|by his cloak]] [[H559|and said,]] [[H7901|“Sleep]] [[H5973|with me!”]] [[H5800|But leaving]] [[H899|his garment]] [[H3027|in her hand,]] [[H5127|he escaped]] [[H3318|and ran]] [[H2351|outside.]] ^3912

[[H7200|When she saw]] [[H3588|that]] [[H5800|he had left]] [[H899|his cloak]] [[H3027|in her hand]] [[H5127|and had run]] [[H2351|out]] ⟨of the house⟩, ^3913

[[H7121|she called]] [[H1004|her household]] [[H376|servants.]] [[H7200|“Look,”]] [[H559|she said,]] [[H5680|“this Hebrew]] [[H935|has been brought]] [[H6711|to us  to make sport]] [[H935|of us.

[[H8085|When he heard]] [[H7311|me scream for help,]] [[H5800|he left]] [[H899|his cloak]] [[H681|beside me]] [[H5127|and ran]] [[H2351|out.”]] ⟨of the house⟩ ^3915

[[H3240|So kept]] ⟨Potiphar’s wife⟩ [[H899|Joseph’s garment]] [[H681|beside her]] [[H5704|until]] [[H113|his master]] [[H935|came]] [[H1004|home.]] ^3916

[[H1696|Then she told]] [[H428|him the same]] [[H1697|story:]] [[H5680|“The Hebrew]] [[H5650|slave]] [[H935|you brought]] [[H413|us]] [[H935|came]] [[H6711|to me  to make sport]] ^3917

[[H1961|When]] [[H113|his master]] [[H8085|heard]] [[H1697|the story]] [[H802|his wife]] [[H1696|told]] [[H413|him,]] [[H559|saying,]] [[H428|“This]] [[H1697|is what]] [[H5650|your slave]] [[H6213|did]] [[H2734|to me,”  he burned]] [[H639|with anger.]] ^3919

[[H3130|So Joseph’s]] [[H113|master]] [[H3947|took]] [[H853|him]] [[H5414|and had him thrown]] [[H413|into]] [[H1004|the prison]] [[H4725|where]] [[H4428|the king’s]] [[H631|prisoners]] [[H631|were confined.]] [[H1961|While was]] ⟨Joseph⟩ [[H8033|there]] [[H1004|in the prison,]] ^3920

[[H3068|the LORD]] [[H1961|was]] [[H854|with]] ⟨him⟩ [[H3130|]] [[H5186|and extended]] [[H2617|kindness]] [[H413|to him.]] [[H5414|He granted]] [[H2580|him favor]] [[H5869|in the eyes]] [[H1004|of the prison]] [[H8269|warden,]] ^3921

⟨who⟩ [[H8269|]] [[H5414|put]] [[H3605|all]] [[H615|those held]] [[H1004|in the prison]] [[H3130|under Joseph’s]] [[H3027|authority,]] [[H1931|so that he]] [[H1961|was]] [[H6213|responsible]] [[H3605|for all]] [[H834|that]] [[H6213|was done]] [[H8033|there.]] ^3922

[[H8269|The warden]] [[H369|did not]] [[H7200|concern himself]] [[H3605|with anything]] [[H3027|under Joseph’s authority,]] [[H834|because]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H854|was with him]] [[H6743|and gave him success]] [[H834|in whatever]] [[H1931|he]] [[H6213|did.]] ^3923

[[H310|Some time later,]] [[H4428|the king’s]] [[H4945|cupbearer]] [[H644|and baker]] [[H2398|offended]] [[H113|their master,]] [[H4428|the king]] [[H4714|of Egypt.]] ^4001

[[H6547|Pharaoh]] [[H7107|was angry]] [[H5921|with]] [[H8147|his two]] [[H5631|officers,]] [[H8269|the chief]] [[H4945|cupbearer]] [[H8269|and the chief]] [[H644|baker,]] ^4002

[[H5414|and imprisoned them]] [[H1004|in the house]] [[H8269|of the captain]] [[H2876|of the guard,]] [[H1004|the same prison]] [[H834|where]] [[H3130|Joseph]] [[H631|was confined.]] ^4003

[[H8269|The captain]] [[H2876|of the guard]] [[H6485|assigned]] [[H854|them]] [[H3130|to Joseph,]] [[H8334|and he became their personal attendant.]] [[H1961|After they had been]] [[H4929|in custody]] [[H3117|for some time,]] ^4004

[[H8147|both]] [[H582|of these men—]] [[H4714|the Egyptian]] [[H4428|king’s]] [[H4945|cupbearer]] [[H644|and baker,]] [[H834|who]] [[H631|were being held]] [[H1004|in the prison—]] [[H2492|had a dream]] [[H259|on the same]] [[H3915|night,]] [[H2472|and each dream]] [[H6623|had its own meaning.]] ^4005

[[H3130|When Joseph]] [[H935|came]] [[H413|to]] [[H1242|them in the morning,]] [[H7200|he saw]] [[H2196|that they looked distraught.]] ^4006

[[H7592|So he asked]] [[H6547|Pharaoh’s]] [[H5631|officials]] [[H834|who]] [[H4929|were in custody]] [[H854|with him]] [[H113|in his master’s]] [[H1004|house,]] [[H4069|“Why]] [[H6440|are your faces]] [[H7451|so downcast]] [[H3117|today?”]] ^4007

[[H2472|“We both had dreams,”]] [[H559|they replied,]] [[H369|“but there is no one]] [[H6622|to interpret them.”]] [[H3130|Then Joseph]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to them,]] [[H3808|“Don’t]] [[H6623|interpretations]] [[H430|belong to God?]] [[H5608|Tell me your dreams.”]] ^4008

[[H8269|So the chief]] [[H4945|cupbearer]] [[H5608|told]] [[H3130|Joseph]] [[H2472|his dream:]] [[H2472|“In my dream]] [[H2009|there]] [[H1612|was a vine]] [[H6440|before me,]] ^4009

[[H1612|and on the vine]] [[H7969|were three]] [[H8299|branches.]] [[H1931|As it]] [[H6524|budded,]] [[H5322|its blossoms]] [[H5927|opened]] [[H811|and its clusters]] [[H1310|ripened]] [[H6025|into grapes.]] ^4010

[[H6547|Pharaoh’s]] [[H3563|cup]] [[H3027|was in my hand,]] [[H3947|and I took]] [[H6025|the grapes,]] [[H7818|squeezed]] [[H413|them into]] ⟨his⟩ [[H6547|]] [[H3563|cup,]] [[H5414|and placed]] [[H3563|the cup]] [[H5921|into]] ⟨his⟩ [[H6547|]] [[H3709|hand.”]] ^4011

[[H3130|Joseph]] [[H559|replied,]] [[H2088|“This]] ⟨is⟩ [[H6623|the interpretation:]] [[H7969|The three]] [[H8299|branches]] [[H7969|are three]] [[H3117|days.]] ^4012

[[H5750|Within]] [[H7969|three]] [[H3117|days]] [[H6547|Pharaoh]] [[H5375|will lift up]] [[H7218|your head]] [[H7725|and restore]] [[H5921|your]] [[H3653|position.]] [[H5414|You will put]] [[H6547|Pharaoh’s]] [[H3563|cup]] [[H3027|into his hand,]] [[H4941|just as]] [[H7223|you did]] [[H834|when]] [[H1961|you were]] [[H4945|his cupbearer.]] ^4013

[[H3588|But]] [[H834|when]] [[H3190|it goes well]] [[H4994|for you,  please]] [[H2142|remember]] [[H854|me]] [[H6213|and show]] [[H5978|me]] [[H2617|kindness]] [[H2142|by mentioning]] [[H413|me to]] [[H6547|Pharaoh,]] [[H3318|that he might bring me out]] [[H4480|of]] [[H2088|this]] [[H1004|prison.]] ^4014

[[H3588|For]] [[H1589|I was kidnapped]] [[H776|from the land]] [[H5680|of the Hebrews,]] [[H1571|and even]] [[H6311|here]] [[H6213|I have done]] [[H3808|nothing]] [[H3588|for which]] [[H7760|they should have put]] [[H853|me]] [[H953|in this dungeon.”]] ^4015

[[H8269|When the chief]] [[H644|baker]] [[H7200|saw]] [[H3588|that]] [[H6622|the interpretation]] [[H2896|was favorable,]] [[H559|he said]] [[H413|to]] [[H3130|Joseph,]] [[H589|“I]] [[H637|too]] [[H2472|had a dream:]] [[H2009|There were]] [[H7969|three]] [[H5536|baskets]] [[H2751|of white bread]] [[H5921|on]] [[H7218|my head.]] ^4016

[[H5945|In the top]] [[H5536|basket]] [[H3605|were all sorts of]] [[H644|baked]] [[H3978|goods]] [[H6547|for Pharaoh,]] [[H5775|but the birds]] [[H398|were eating]] [[H4480|them out of]] [[H5536|the basket]] [[H5921|on]] [[H7218|my head.”]] ^4017

[[H3130|Joseph]] [[H6030|replied,]] [[H2088|“This]] [[H6623|is the interpretation:]] [[H7969|The three]] [[H5536|baskets]] [[H7969|are three]] [[H3117|days.]] ^4018

[[H5750|Within]] [[H7969|three]] [[H3117|days]] [[H6547|Pharaoh]] [[H5375|will lift]] [[H7218|your head]] [[H5921|off of you]] [[H8518|and hang]] [[H853|you]] [[H5921|on]] [[H6086|a tree.]] [[H5775|Then the birds]] [[H398|will eat]] [[H1320|the flesh]] [[H5921|of your body.”]] ^4019

[[H7992|On the third]] [[H3117|day,]] [[H6547|which was Pharaoh’s]] [[H3117|birthday,]] [[H6213|he held]] [[H4960|a feast]] [[H3605|for all]] [[H5650|his officials,]] [[H8432|and in]] ⟨their presence⟩ [[H5650|]] [[H5375|he lifted up]] [[H7218|the heads]] [[H8269|of the chief]] [[H4945|cupbearer]] [[H8269|and the chief]] [[H644|baker.]] ^4020

[[H7725|Pharaoh restored]] [[H8269|the chief]] [[H4945|cupbearer]] [[H5921|to]] [[H4945|his position,]] [[H5414|so that he once again placed]] [[H3563|the cup]] [[H5921|in]] [[H6547|Pharaoh’s]] [[H3709|hand.]] ^4021

[[H853|But]] [[H8518|Pharaoh hanged]] [[H8269|the chief]] [[H644|baker,]] [[H834|just as]] [[H3130|Joseph]] [[H6622|had interpreted]] ⟨the dream⟩ ^4022

[[H8269|The chief]] [[H4945|cupbearer,]] [[H3808|however, did not]] [[H2142|remember]] [[H3130|Joseph;]] [[H7911|he forgot all about him.]] ^4023

[[H1961|After]] [[H8141|two full years]] [[H7093|had passed,]] [[H6547|Pharaoh]] [[H2492|had a dream:]] [[H5975|He was standing]] [[H5921|beside]] [[H2975|the Nile,]] ^4101

[[H7651|when seven]] [[H6510|cows,]] [[H3303|sleek]] [[H1277|and well-fed,]] [[H5927|came up]] [[H4480|from]] [[H2975|the river]] [[H7462|and began to graze]] [[H260|among the reeds.]] ^4102

[[H310|After them,]] [[H7651|seven]] [[H312|other]] [[H6510|cows,]] [[H7451|sickly]] [[H1851|and thin,]] [[H5927|came up]] [[H4480|from]] [[H2975|the Nile]] [[H5975|and stood]] [[H681|beside]] [[H6510|the cows]] ⟨other⟩ [[H5921|on]] [[H8193|the bank]] [[H2975|of the river.]] ^4103

[[H6510|And the cows]] ⟨that were⟩ [[H7451|sickly]] [[H1851|and thin]] [[H398|ate up]] [[H7651|the seven]] [[H3303|sleek,]] [[H1277|well-fed]] [[H6510|cows.]] [[H6547|Then Pharaoh]] [[H3364|woke up,]] ^4104

[[H3462|but he fell back asleep]] [[H2492|and dreamed]] [[H8145|a second time:]] [[H7651|Seven]] [[H7641|heads of grain,]] [[H1277|plump]] [[H2896|and ripe,]] [[H5927|came up]] [[H259|on one]] [[H7070|stalk.]] ^4105

[[H310|After them,]] [[H7651|seven other]] [[H7641|heads of grain]] [[H6779|sprouted,]] [[H1851|thin]] [[H7710|and scorched]] [[H6921|by the east wind.]] ^4106

[[H1851|And the thin]] [[H7641|heads of grain]] [[H1104|swallowed up]] [[H7651|the seven]] [[H1277|plump,]] [[H4392|ripe]] [[H7641|ones.]] [[H6547|Then Pharaoh]] [[H3364|awoke]] [[H2009|and realized]] [[H2472|it was a dream.]] ^4107

[[H1242|In the morning]] [[H7307|his spirit]] [[H6470|was troubled,]] [[H7971|so he summoned]] [[H3605|all]] [[H2748|the magicians]] [[H3605|and]] [[H2450|wise men]] [[H4714|of Egypt.]] [[H6547|Pharaoh]] [[H5608|told]] [[H2472|them his dreams,]] [[H369|but no one]] [[H6622|could interpret]] [[H853|them]] [[H6547|for him.]] ^4108

[[H8269|Then the chief]] [[H4945|cupbearer]] [[H1696|said]] [[H854|to]] [[H6547|Pharaoh,]] [[H3117|“Today]] [[H589|I]] [[H2142|recall]] [[H2399|my failures.]] ^4109

[[H6547|Pharaoh]] [[H7107|was once angry]] [[H5921|with]] [[H5650|his servants,]] [[H5414|and he put]] [[H853|me]] [[H853|and]] [[H8269|the chief]] [[H644|baker]] [[H4929|in the custody]] [[H8269|of the captain]] [[H2876|of the guard.]] ^4110

[[H259|One]] [[H3915|night]] [[H1931|both]] ⟨the chief baker⟩ [[H589|and I]] [[H2492|had dreams,]] ⟨and⟩ [[H376|each]] [[H2472|dream]] [[H6623|had its own meaning.]] ^4111

[[H5288|Now a young]] [[H5680|Hebrew]] [[H8033|was there]] [[H854|with us,]] [[H5650|a servant]] [[H8269|of the captain]] [[H2876|of the guard.]] [[H5608|We told]] [[H6622|him and he interpreted]] ⟨our dreams⟩ ⟨them⟩ [[H2472|]] [[H853|for  us]] [[H582|individually.]] ^4112

[[H1961|And it happened]] [[H834|to us  just as]] [[H6622|he had interpreted:]] [[H7725|I was restored]] [[H5921|to]] [[H3653|my position,]] [[H8518|and the other man was hanged.”]] ^4113

[[H6547|So Pharaoh]] [[H7971|sent for]] [[H3130|Joseph,]] [[H7323|who was quickly brought]] [[H4480|out of]] [[H953|the dungeon.]] [[H1548|After he had shaved]] [[H2498|and changed]] [[H8071|his clothes,]] [[H935|he went in]] [[H413|before]] [[H6547|Pharaoh.]] ^4114

[[H6547|Pharaoh]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H3130|Joseph,]] [[H2472|“I had a dream,]] [[H369|and no]] [[H6622|one can interpret it.]] [[H589|But I]] [[H8085|have received word]] [[H5921|about you]] [[H8085|that when you hear]] [[H2472|a dream]] [[H6622|you can interpret it.”]] ^4115

[[H1107|“I myself cannot do it,”]] [[H3130|Joseph]] [[H6030|replied,]] [[H430|“but God]] [[H6547|will give Pharaoh]] [[H7965|a favorable]] [[H6030|answer.”]] ^4116

[[H6547|Then Pharaoh]] [[H1696|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H3130|Joseph:]] [[H2472|“In my dream]] [[H5975|I was standing]] [[H5921|on]] [[H8193|the bank]] [[H2975|of the Nile,]] ^4117

[[H7651|when seven]] [[H6510|cows,]] [[H1277|well-fed]] [[H3303|and sleek,]] [[H5927|came up]] [[H4480|from]] [[H2975|the river]] [[H7462|and began to graze]] [[H260|among the reeds.]] ^4118

[[H310|After them,]] [[H7651|seven]] [[H312|other]] [[H6510|cows,]] [[H7451|sickly,]] [[H8389|ugly,]] [[H7534|and thin,]] [[H5927|came up.]] [[H3808|I have never]] [[H7200|seen]] [[H7455|such ugly]] ⟨cows⟩ [[H2007|]] [[H3605|in all]] [[H776|the land]] [[H4714|of Egypt!]] ^4119

[[H7534|Then the thin,]] [[H7451|ugly]] [[H6510|cows]] [[H398|devoured]] [[H7651|the seven]] [[H1277|well-fed]] [[H6510|cows]] [[H7223|that were there first.]] ^4120

[[H935|When they had devoured]] [[H7130|them, however,]] [[H3808|no one could]] [[H3045|tell]] [[H3588|that]] [[H935|they had]] ⟨done so⟩; [[H4758|their appearance]] [[H7451|was as ugly]] [[H834|as]] [[H8462|it had been before.]] [[H3364|Then I awoke.]] ^4121

[[H2472|In my dream]] [[H7200|I also saw]] [[H7651|seven]] [[H7641|heads of grain,]] [[H4392|plump]] [[H2896|and ripe,]] [[H5927|growing on]] [[H259|a single]] [[H7070|stalk.]] ^4122

[[H310|After them,]] [[H7651|seven other]] [[H7641|heads of grain]] [[H6779|sprouted—]] [[H6798|withered,]] [[H1851|thin,]] [[H7710|and scorched]] [[H6921|by the east wind.]] ^4123

[[H1851|And the thin]] [[H7641|heads of grain]] [[H1104|swallowed]] [[H7651|the seven]] [[H2896|plump]] [[H7641|ones.]] [[H559|I told]] [[H413|this to]] ⟨dream⟩ [[H2748|the magicians,]] [[H369|but no]] [[H5046|one could explain it]] ^4124

[[H3130|Then Joseph]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H6547|Pharaoh,]] [[H2472|“The dreams]] [[H6547|of Pharaoh]] [[H259|are one and the same.]] [[H430|God]] [[H5046|has revealed]] [[H6547|to Pharaoh]] [[H834|what]] [[H6213|He is about to do.]] ^4125

[[H7651|The seven]] [[H2896|good]] [[H6510|cows]] [[H7651|are seven]] [[H8141|years,]] [[H7651|and the seven]] [[H2896|ripe]] [[H7641|heads of grain]] [[H7651|are seven]] [[H8141|years.]] [[H2472|The dreams]] [[H259|have the same meaning.]] ^4126

[[H7651|Moreover, the seven]] [[H7534|thin,]] [[H7451|ugly]] [[H6510|cows]] [[H5927|that came up]] [[H310|after them]] [[H7651|are seven]] [[H8141|years,]] [[H2007|and so are]] [[H7651|the seven]] [[H7386|worthless]] [[H7641|heads of grain]] [[H7710|scorched]] [[H6921|by the east wind—]] [[H1961|they are]] [[H7651|seven]] [[H8141|years]] [[H7458|of famine.]] ^4127

[[H1931|It]] [[H834|is just as]] [[H1696|I said]] [[H413|to]] [[H6547|Pharaoh:]] [[H430|God]] [[H7200|has shown]] [[H6547|Pharaoh]] [[H834|what]] [[H6213|He is about to do.]] ^4128

[[H2009|Behold,]] [[H7651|seven]] [[H8141|years]] [[H1419|of great]] [[H7647|abundance]] [[H935|are coming]] [[H3605|throughout]] [[H776|the land]] [[H4714|of Egypt,]] ^4129

[[H7651|but seven]] [[H8141|years]] [[H7458|of famine]] [[H6965|will follow]] [[H310|them.]] [[H3605|Then all]] [[H7647|the abundance]] [[H776|in the land]] [[H4714|of Egypt]] [[H7911|will be forgotten]] [[H7458|and the famine]] [[H3615|will devastate]] [[H776|the land.]] ^4130

[[H7647|The abundance]] [[H776|in the land]] [[H3808|will not]] [[H3045|be remembered,]] [[H6440|since]] [[H1931|the]] [[H7458|famine]] [[H310|that follows]] [[H3651|it]] ⟨will be⟩ [[H3966|so]] [[H3515|severe.]] ^4131

[[H5921|Moreover, on]] [[H3588|the basis of]] [[H2472|the dream]] [[H6471|being given]] [[H413|to]] [[H6547|Pharaoh]] [[H8138|in two versions,]] [[H1697|the matter]] [[H3559|has been decreed]] [[H5973|by]] [[H430|God,]] [[H430|and He]] [[H6213|will carry it out]] [[H4116|shortly.]] ^4132

[[H6258|Now therefore,]] [[H6547|Pharaoh]] [[H7200|should look for]] [[H995|a discerning]] [[H2450|and wise]] [[H376|man]] [[H7896|and set]] [[H5921|him over]] [[H776|the land]] [[H4714|of Egypt.]] ^4133

[[H6547|Let Pharaoh]] [[H6213|take action]] [[H6485|and appoint]] [[H6496|commissioners]] [[H5921|over]] [[H776|the land]] [[H2567|to take a fifth]] [[H776|of harvest]] ⟨its⟩ [[H7651|during the seven]] [[H8141|years]] [[H7647|of abundance.]] ^4134

[[H8478|Under]] [[H3027|the authority]] [[H6547|of Pharaoh,]] [[H6908|let them collect]] [[H3605|all]] [[H400|the excess food]] [[H428|from these]] [[H2896|good]] [[H8141|years,]] [[H935|that they may come]] [[H6651|and lay up]] [[H1250|the grain]] [[H8104|to be preserved]] [[H400|as food]] [[H5892|in the cities.]] ^4135

[[H400|This food]] [[H1961|will be]] [[H6487|a reserve]] [[H776|for the land]] [[H7651|during the seven]] [[H8141|years]] [[H7458|of famine]] [[H1961|to come]] [[H776|upon the land]] [[H4714|of Egypt.]] [[H776|Then the country]] [[H3808|will not]] [[H3772|perish]] [[H7458|in the famine.”]] ^4136

[[H1697|This proposal]] [[H3190|pleased]] [[H6547|Pharaoh]] [[H3605|and all]] [[H5650|his officials.]] ^4137

[[H6547|So Pharaoh]] [[H559|asked]] ⟨them⟩ [[H5650|,]] [[H4672|“Can we find]] [[H2088|anyone like this]] [[H376|man,]] [[H834|in  whom]] [[H7307|the Spirit]] [[H430|of God?”]] ⟨abides⟩ ^4138

[[H6547|Then Pharaoh]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H3130|Joseph,]] [[H310|“Since]] [[H430|God]] [[H3605|has made all]] [[H2063|this]] [[H3045|known to you,]] [[H369|there is no one]] [[H995|as discerning]] [[H2450|and wise]] [[H3644|as you.]] ^4139

[[H859|You]] [[H1961|shall be]] [[H5921|in charge of]] [[H1004|my house,]] [[H3605|and all]] [[H5971|my people]] [[H5401|are to obey]] [[H6310|your commands.]] [[H7535|Only]] [[H3678|with regard to the throne]] [[H1431|will I be greater]] [[H4480|than you.”]] ^4140

[[H6547|Pharaoh]] [[H559|also told]] [[H3130|Joseph,]] [[H5414|“I hereby place]] [[H5921|you over]] [[H3605|all]] [[H776|the land]] [[H4714|of Egypt.”]] ^4141

[[H6547|Then Pharaoh]] [[H5493|removed]] [[H2885|the signet ring]] [[H5921|from]] [[H3027|his finger,]] [[H5414|put]] [[H5921|it on]] [[H3130|Joseph’s]] [[H3027|finger,]] [[H3847|clothed]] [[H853|him]] [[H899|in garments]] [[H8336|of fine linen,]] [[H7760|and placed]] [[H2091|a gold]] [[H7242|chain]] [[H5921|around]] [[H6677|his neck.]] ^4142

[[H7392|He had Joseph ride]] [[H4932|in his second]] [[H4818|chariot,]] [[H7121|with men calling out]] [[H6440|before him,]] [[H86|“Bow the knee!”]] [[H5414|So he placed]] [[H5921|him over]] [[H3605|all]] [[H776|the land]] [[H4714|of Egypt.]] ^4143

[[H6547|And Pharaoh]] [[H559|declared]] [[H413|to]] [[H3130|Joseph,]] [[H589|“I]] [[H6547|am Pharaoh,]] [[H1107|but without your permission,]] [[H3808|no]] [[H376|one]] [[H3605|in all]] [[H776|the land]] [[H4714|of Egypt]] [[H7311|shall lift]] [[H3027|his hand]] [[H853|or]] [[H7272|foot.”]] ^4144

[[H6547|Pharaoh]] [[H7121|gave]] [[H3130|Joseph]] [[H8034|the name]] [[H6847|Zaphenath-Paneah,]] [[H5414|and he gave]] [[H621|him  Asenath]] [[H1323|daughter]] [[H6319|of Potiphera,]] [[H3548|priest]] [[H204|of On,]] [[H802|to be his wife.]] [[H3130|And Joseph]] [[H3318|took charge]] [[H5921|over]] ⟨all⟩ [[H776|the land]] [[H4714|of Egypt.]] ^4145

[[H3130|Now Joseph]] [[H7970|was thirty]] [[H1121|years old]] [[H5975|when he entered the service]] [[H6547|of Pharaoh]] [[H4428|king]] [[H4714|of Egypt.]] [[H3130|And Joseph]] [[H3318|left]] [[H6547|Pharaoh’s]] [[H6440|presence]] [[H5674|and traveled]] [[H3605|throughout]] [[H776|the land]] [[H4714|of Egypt.]] ^4146

[[H7651|During the seven]] [[H8141|years]] [[H7647|of abundance,]] [[H776|the land]] [[H6213|brought forth]] [[H7062|bountifully.]] ^4147

[[H7651|During those seven]] [[H8141|years,]] [[H6908|Joseph collected]] [[H3605|all]] [[H400|the excess food]] [[H776|in the land]] [[H4714|of Egypt]] [[H5414|and stored]] [[H400|it]] [[H5892|in the cities.]] [[H8432|In]] [[H5892|every city]] [[H5414|he laid up]] [[H400|the food]] [[H7704|from the fields]] [[H5439|around it.]] ^4148

[[H3130|So Joseph]] [[H6651|stored up]] [[H1250|grain]] [[H7235|in such abundance,]] [[H2344|like the sand]] [[H3220|of the sea,]] [[H3588|that]] [[H2308|he stopped]] [[H5608|keeping track of it;]] [[H3588|for]] [[H369|it was beyond]] [[H4557|measure.]] ^4149

[[H2962|Before]] [[H8141|the years]] [[H7458|of famine]] [[H935|arrived,]] [[H8147|two]] [[H1121|sons]] [[H3205|were born]] [[H3130|to Joseph]] [[H621|by Asenath]] [[H1323|daughter]] [[H6319|of Potiphera,]] [[H3548|priest]] [[H204|of On.]] ^4150

[[H3130|Joseph]] [[H7121|named]] [[H1060|the firstborn]] [[H4519|Manasseh,]] [[H3588|saying,]] [[H430|“God]] [[H5382|has made me forget]] [[H3605|all]] [[H5999|my hardship]] [[H3605|and all]] [[H1|my father’s]] [[H1004|household.”]] ^4151

[[H8145|And the second]] ⟨son⟩ [[H8034|he named]] [[H669|Ephraim,]] [[H3588|saying,]] [[H430|“God]] [[H6509|has made me fruitful]] [[H776|in the land]] [[H6040|of my affliction.”]] ^4152

[[H7651|When the seven]] [[H8141|years]] [[H7647|of abundance]] [[H4714|in Egypt]] [[H3615|came to an end,]] ^4153

[[H7651|the seven]] [[H8141|years]] [[H7458|of famine]] [[H2490|began,]] [[H834|just as]] [[H3130|Joseph]] [[H559|had said.]] [[H1961|And although there was]] [[H7458|famine]] [[H3605|in every]] [[H776|country,]] [[H1961|there was]] [[H3899|food]] [[H3605|throughout]] [[H776|the land]] [[H4714|of Egypt.]] ^4154

[[H7456|When extreme hunger]] [[H3605|came to all]] [[H776|the land]] [[H4714|of Egypt]] [[H5971|and the people]] [[H6817|cried out]] [[H413|to]] [[H6547|Pharaoh]] [[H3899|for food,]] ⟨he⟩ [[H6547|]] [[H559|told]] [[H3605|all]] [[H4713|the Egyptians,]] [[H1980|“Go]] [[H413|to]] [[H3130|Joseph]] [[H6213|and do]] [[H834|whatever]] [[H559|he tells]] ^4155

[[H7458|When the famine]] [[H1961|had spread]] [[H5921|over]] [[H3605|all]] [[H6440|the]] [[H776|land,]] [[H3130|Joseph]] [[H6605|opened up]] [[H3605|all]] [[H7666|the storehouses and sold grain]] [[H4713|to the Egyptians;]] [[H7458|for the famine]] [[H2388|was severe]] [[H776|in the land]] [[H4714|of Egypt.]] ^4156

[[H3605|And every]] [[H776|nation]] [[H935|came]] [[H413|to]] [[H3130|Joseph]] [[H4714|in Egypt]] [[H7666|to buy grain,]] [[H3588|because]] [[H7458|the famine]] [[H2388|was severe]] [[H3605|over all]] [[H776|the earth.]] ^4157

[[H3290|When Jacob]] [[H7200|learned]] [[H3588|that]] [[H3426|there was]] [[H7668|grain]] [[H4714|in Egypt,]] [[H3290|he]] [[H559|said]] [[H1121|to his sons,]] [[H4100|“Why]] [[H7200|are you staring at one another?”]] ^4201

[[H2009|“Look,”]] [[H559|he added,]] [[H8085|“I have heard]] [[H3588|that]] [[H3426|there is]] [[H7668|grain]] [[H4714|in Egypt.]] [[H3381|Go down]] [[H8033|there]] [[H7666|and buy]] [[H2421|some for us,  so that we may live]] [[H3808|and not]] [[H4191|die.”]] ^4202

[[H6235|So ten]] [[H3130|of Joseph’s]] [[H251|brothers]] [[H3381|went down]] [[H7666|to buy]] [[H1250|grain]] [[H4714|from Egypt.]] ^4203

[[H3290|But Jacob]] [[H3808|did not]] [[H7971|send]] [[H3130|Joseph’s]] [[H251|brother]] [[H1144|Benjamin]] [[H854|with]] [[H251|his brothers,]] [[H3588|for]] [[H559|he said,]] [[H6435|“I am afraid that]] [[H611|harm]] [[H7122|might befall him.”]] ^4204

[[H1121|So the sons]] [[H3478|of Israel]] [[H8432|were among]] [[H935|those who]] [[H935|came]] [[H7666|to buy grain,]] [[H3588|since]] [[H7458|the famine]] [[H1961|had spread]] ⟨also⟩ [[H776|to the land]] [[H3667|of Canaan.]] ^4205

[[H3130|Now Joseph]] [[H7989|was the ruler]] [[H5921|of]] [[H776|the land,]] [[H1931|who]] [[H7666|sold grain]] [[H3605|to all]] [[H776|its]] [[H5971|people.]] [[H3130|So when]] ⟨his⟩ [[H251|brothers]] [[H935|arrived,]] [[H7812|they bowed down]] [[H639|before him  with their faces]] [[H776|to the ground.]] ^4206

[[H3130|When Joseph]] [[H7200|saw]] [[H251|his brothers,]] [[H5234|he recognized them,]] [[H5234|but he treated them as strangers]] [[H1696|and spoke]] [[H7186|harshly]] [[H854|to them.]] [[H370|“Where]] [[H935|have you come from?”]] [[H559|he asked.]] [[H776|“From the land]] [[H3667|of Canaan,”]] [[H559|they replied.]] [[H7666|“ to buy]] ⟨We are here⟩ [[H400|food.”]] ^4207

[[H3130|Although Joseph]] [[H5234|recognized]] [[H251|his brothers,]] [[H1992|they]] [[H3808|did not]] [[H5234|recognize him.]] ^4208

[[H3130|Joseph]] [[H2142|remembered]] [[H2472|his dreams]] [[H559|about them  and said,]] [[H859|“You]] [[H7270|are spies!]] [[H935|You have come]] [[H7200|to see]] [[H776|if our land]] ⟨is⟩ [[H6172|vulnerable.”]] ^4209

[[H3808|“Not so,]] [[H113|my lord,”]] [[H559|they replied.]] [[H5650|“Your servants]] [[H935|have come]] [[H7666|to buy]] [[H400|food.]] ^4210

[[H5168|We]] [[H3605|are all]] [[H1121|sons]] [[H259|of one]] [[H376|man.]] [[H5650|Your servants]] [[H1961|are]] [[H3651|honest]] ⟨men⟩, [[H3808|not]] [[H7270|spies.”]] ^4211

[[H3808|“No,”]] [[H559|he told]] [[H413|them.]] [[H935|“You have come]] [[H7200|to see]] [[H776|if our land]] ⟨is⟩ [[H6172|vulnerable.”]] ^4212

[[H559|But they answered,]] [[H5650|“Your servants]] [[H8147|are twelve]] [[H251|brothers,]] [[H1121|the sons]] [[H259|of one]] [[H376|man]] [[H776|in the land]] [[H3667|of Canaan.]] [[H6996|The youngest]] [[H3117|is now]] [[H854|with]] [[H1|our father,]] [[H259|and one]] [[H369|is no more.”]] ^4213

[[H3130|Then Joseph]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to them,]] [[H1696|“Just as I said,]] [[H859|you]] [[H7270|are spies!]] ^4214

[[H2063|And this is how]] [[H974|you will be tested:]] [[H6547|As surely as Pharaoh]] [[H2416|lives,]] [[H518|you shall not]] [[H3318|leave]] [[H2088|this]] [[H3588|place unless]] [[H6996|your youngest]] [[H251|brother]] [[H935|comes]] [[H2008|here.]] ^4215

[[H7971|Send]] [[H259|one]] [[H4480|of your number]] [[H3947|to get]] [[H251|your brother;]] [[H859|the rest of you]] [[H631|will be confined]] [[H571|so that the truth]] [[H1697|of your words]] [[H974|may be tested.]] [[H518|If]] [[H3808|they are untrue,]] [[H6547|then as surely as Pharaoh]] [[H2416|lives,]] [[H859|you]] [[H7270|are spies!”]] ^4216

[[H622|So Joseph imprisoned them]] [[H7969|for three]] [[H3117|days,]] ^4217

[[H7992|and on the third]] [[H3117|day]] ⟨he⟩ [[H3130|]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to them,]] [[H6213|“Do]] [[H2063|this]] [[H2421|and you will live,]] ⟨for⟩ [[H589|I]] [[H3372|fear]] [[H430|God.]] ^4218

[[H518|If]] [[H859|you]] [[H3651|are honest,]] [[H259|leave one]] [[H631|of your brothers in custody]] [[H859|while the rest of you]] [[H1980|go]] [[H935|and take back]] [[H7668|grain]] [[H7459|to relieve the hunger]] [[H1004|of your households.]] ^4219

[[H853|Then]] [[H935|bring]] [[H6996|your youngest]] [[H251|brother]] [[H413|to me]] [[H1697|so that your words]] [[H539|can be verified,]] [[H3808|that you may not]] [[H4191|die.”]] [[H3651|And to this]] [[H6213|they consented.]] ^4220

[[H559|Then they said]] [[H413|to]] [[H376|one]] [[H251|another,]] [[H61|“Surely]] [[H587|we]] [[H818|are being punished]] [[H5921|because of]] [[H251|our brother.]] [[H7200|We saw]] [[H5315|his]] [[H6869|anguish]] [[H2603|when he pleaded]] [[H413|with us,]] [[H3808|but we would not]] [[H8085|listen.]] [[H5921|That is why]] [[H2063|this]] [[H6869|distress]] [[H935|has come]] [[H413|upon us.]] ^4221

[[H7205|But Reuben]] [[H6030|replied:]] [[H3808|“Didn’t]] [[H559|I tell]] [[H408|you not]] [[H2398|to sin against]] [[H3206|the boy?]] [[H3808|But you would not]] [[H8085|listen.]] [[H2009|Now]] [[H1875|we must account for]] [[H1818|his blood!”]] ^4222

[[H1992|They]] [[H3808|did not]] [[H3045|realize]] [[H3588|that]] [[H3130|Joseph]] [[H8085|understood them,]] [[H3588|since]] [[H3887|there was an interpreter]] [[H996|between them.]] ^4223

[[H5437|And he turned away]] [[H5921|from]] [[H1058|them and wept.]] [[H7725|When he turned back]] [[H1696|and spoke]] [[H413|to them,]] [[H3947|he took]] [[H8095|Simeon]] [[H853|from them]] [[H631|and had him bound]] [[H5869|before their eyes.]] ^4224

[[H3130|Then Joseph]] [[H6680|gave orders]] [[H3627|to fill their bags]] [[H4390|with]] [[H1250|grain,]] [[H7725|return]] [[H376|each]] [[H3701|man’s silver]] [[H413|to]] [[H8242|his sack,]] [[H5414|and give]] [[H6720|them provisions]] [[H1870|for their journey.]] [[H3651|This]] [[H6213|order was carried out,]] ^4225

[[H5375|and they loaded]] [[H7668|the grain]] [[H5921|on]] [[H2543|their donkeys]] [[H1980|and departed.]] ^4226

[[H4411|At the place where they lodged for the night,]] [[H259|one]] [[H6605|of them opened]] [[H8242|his sack]] [[H5414|to get]] [[H4554|feed]] [[H2543|for his donkey,]] [[H7200|and he saw]] [[H3701|his silver]] [[H6310|in the mouth]] [[H572|of the sack.]] ^4227

[[H3701|“My money]] [[H7725|has been returned!”]] [[H559|he said]] [[H413|to]] [[H251|his brothers.]] [[H2009|“It is here]] [[H572|in my sack.”]] [[H3820|Their hearts]] [[H3318|sank,]] [[H2729|and trembling,]] [[H413|they turned to]] [[H376|one]] [[H251|another]] [[H559|and said,]] [[H4100|“What]] [[H2063|is this]] [[H430|that God]] [[H6213|has done]] ^4228

[[H935|When they reached]] [[H1|their father]] [[H3290|Jacob]] [[H776|in the land]] [[H3667|of Canaan,]] [[H5046|they described]] [[H3605|to  him all]] [[H7136|that had happened to them:]] ^4229

[[H582|“The man]] [[H113|who is the lord]] [[H776|of the land]] [[H1696|spoke]] [[H7186|harshly]] [[H854|to us]] [[H7270|and accused us of spying]] [[H776|on the country.]] ^4230

[[H559|But we told]] [[H413|him,]] [[H587|‘We]] [[H1961|are]] [[H3651|honest men,]] [[H3808|not]] [[H7270|spies.]] ^4231

[[H376|Then the man]] [[H113|who is the lord]] [[H776|of the land]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to us,]] [[H2063|‘This is how]] [[H3045|I will know]] [[H3588|whether]] [[H859|you]] [[H3651|are honest:]] [[H3240|Leave]] [[H259|one]] [[H251|brother]] [[H854|with me,]] [[H3947|take]] [[H7459|food to relieve the hunger]] [[H1004|of your households,]] [[H1980|and go.]] ^4233

[[H935|But bring]] [[H6996|your youngest]] [[H251|brother]] [[H413|back to me]] [[H3045|so I will know]] [[H3588|that]] [[H859|you]] [[H3808|are not]] [[H7270|spies]] [[H3588|but]] [[H3651|honest men.]] [[H251|Then I will give your brother]] [[H5414|back to you,]] [[H5503|and you can trade]] [[H776|in the land.’”]] ^4234

[[H1992|As they]] [[H7324|began emptying]] [[H8242|their sacks,]] [[H2009|there]] [[H376|in each man’s]] [[H8242|sack]] [[H6872|was his bag]] [[H3701|of silver!]] [[H1992|And when they]] [[H1|and their father]] [[H7200|saw]] [[H6872|the bags]] [[H3701|of money,]] [[H3372|they were dismayed.]] ^4235

[[H1|Their father]] [[H3290|Jacob]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to them,]] [[H7921|“You have deprived me of my sons.]] [[H3130|Joseph]] [[H369|is gone]] [[H8095|and Simeon]] [[H369|is no more.]] [[H3947|Now you want to take]] [[H1144|Benjamin.]] [[H3605|Everything]] [[H1961|is happening]] [[H5921|against me!”]] ^4236

[[H7205|Then Reuben]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H1|his father,]] [[H4191|“You may kill]] [[H8147|my two]] [[H1121|sons]] [[H518|if]] [[H3808|I fail]] [[H935|to bring him back]] [[H413|to you.]] [[H5414|Put]] [[H5921|him in]] [[H3027|my care,]] [[H589|and I]] [[H7725|will return him.”]] ^4237

[[H559|But Jacob replied,]] [[H1121|“My son]] [[H3808|will not]] [[H3381|go down there]] [[H5973|with you,]] [[H3588|for]] [[H251|his brother]] [[H4191|is dead,]] [[H1931|and he]] [[H905|alone]] [[H7604|is left.]] [[H7122|If any harm comes]] [[H834|to him on your]] [[H1870|journey,]] [[H7872|you will bring my gray hairs]] [[H3381|down]] [[H7585|to Sheol]] [[H3015|in sorrow.”]] ^4238

[[H7458|Now the famine]] [[H3515|was still severe]] [[H776|in the land.]] ^4301

[[H834|So when]] ⟨Jacob’s sons⟩ [[H3615|had eaten all]] [[H7668|the grain]] [[H935|they had brought]] [[H4714|from Egypt,]] [[H1|their father]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to them,]] [[H7725|“Go back]] [[H7666|and buy]] [[H4592|a little more]] [[H400|food]] ^4302

[[H3063|But Judah]] [[H559|replied,]] [[H376|“The man]] [[H5749|solemnly warned]] [[H3808|us,  ‘You will not]] [[H7200|see]] [[H6440|my face]] [[H1115|again unless]] [[H251|your brother]] [[H854|is with you.’]] ^4303

[[H518|If]] [[H7971|you will send]] [[H251|our brother]] [[H854|with us,]] [[H3381|we will go down]] [[H7666|and buy]] [[H400|food]] ^4304

[[H518|But if]] [[H369|you will not]] [[H7971|send him,]] [[H3808|we will not]] [[H3381|go;]] [[H3588|for]] [[H376|the man]] [[H559|told]] [[H413|us,]] [[H3808|‘You will not]] [[H7200|see]] [[H6440|my face]] [[H1115|again unless]] [[H251|your brother]] [[H854|is with you.’”]] ^4305

[[H4100|“Why]] [[H7489|did you bring this trouble]] [[H3478|upon me?”  Israel]] [[H559|asked.]] [[H5046|“Why did you tell]] [[H376|the man]] [[H5750|you had another]] [[H251|brother?”]] ^4306

[[H559|They replied,]] [[H376|“The man]] [[H7592|questioned]] [[H7592|us  in detail]] [[H4138|about ourselves and our family:]] [[H1|‘Is your father]] [[H5750|still]] [[H2416|alive?]] [[H3426|Do you have]] [[H251|another brother?’]] [[H5046|And we answered]] [[H5921|him  accordingly.]] [[H3045|How could we possibly know]] [[H3588|that]] [[H559|he would say,]] [[H3381|‘Bring]] [[H251|your brother here’?”]] ^4307

[[H3063|And Judah]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H1|his father]] [[H3478|Israel,]] [[H7971|“Send]] [[H5288|the boy]] [[H854|with me,]] [[H1980|and we will go at once,]] [[H2421|so that we may live]] [[H3808|and not]] [[H4191|die—]] [[H587|neither we,]] [[H859|nor you,]] [[H2945|nor our children.]] ^4308

[[H595|I]] [[H6148|will guarantee his safety.]] [[H1245|You may hold me]] [[H3027|personally responsible!]] [[H518|If]] [[H3808|I do not]] [[H935|bring him back]] [[H3322|and set]] [[H6440|him before you,]] [[H2398|then let me  bear the guilt before you]] [[H3605|all my life.]] ^4309

[[H3588|If we had not]] [[H4102|delayed,]] [[H7725|we could have come and gone]] [[H6471|twice]] [[H6258|by now.”]] ^4310

[[H1|Then their father]] [[H3478|Israel]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to them,]] [[H518|“If]] [[H3651|it must be so,]] [[H645|then]] [[H6213|do]] [[H2063|this:]] [[H3947|Put]] [[H2173|some of the best products]] [[H776|of the land]] [[H3627|in your packs]] [[H3381|and carry them down]] [[H4503|as a gift]] [[H582|for the man—]] [[H4592|a little]] [[H6875|balm]] [[H4592|and a little]] [[H1706|honey,]] [[H5219|spices]] [[H3910|and myrrh,]] [[H992|pistachios]] [[H8247|and almonds.]] ^4311

[[H3947|Take]] [[H4932|double]] [[H3701|the money]] [[H3027|with you]] [[H853|so that]] [[H7725|you may return]] [[H3701|the money]] [[H7725|that was put back into]] [[H6310|in the mouths]] [[H572|of your sacks.]] [[H194|Perhaps]] [[H1931|it]] [[H4870|was a mistake.]] ^4312

[[H3947|Take]] [[H251|your brother also,]] [[H7725|and return]] [[H413|to]] [[H376|the man]] [[H6965|at once.]] ^4313

[[H410|May God]] [[H7706|Almighty]] [[H5414|grant]] [[H7356|you  mercy]] [[H6440|before]] [[H376|the man]] [[H7971|so that he will release]] [[H312|your other]] [[H251|brother]] [[H1144|along with Benjamin.]] [[H589|As for me,]] [[H834|if]] [[H7921|I am bereaved,]] [[H7921|I am bereaved.”]] ^4314

[[H376|So the men]] [[H3947|took]] [[H2063|these]] [[H4503|gifts,]] [[H4932|along with double]] [[H3701|the amount of money,]] [[H853|and]] [[H1144|Benjamin as well.]] [[H3381|They made their way down]] [[H4714|to Egypt]] [[H5975|and stood]] [[H6440|before]] [[H3130|Joseph.]] ^4315

[[H3130|When Joseph]] [[H7200|saw]] [[H1144|Benjamin]] [[H854|with]] ⟨his brothers⟩, [[H559|he said]] [[H834|to the steward]] [[H5921|of]] [[H1004|his house,]] [[H935|“Take]] [[H582|these men]] [[H1004|to my house.]] [[H2873|Slaughter]] [[H2874|an animal]] [[H3559|and prepare it,]] [[H3588|for]] [[H398|they shall dine]] [[H854|with]] [[H6672|me at noon.”]] ^4316

[[H376|The man]] [[H6213|did]] [[H834|as]] [[H3130|Joseph]] [[H559|had commanded]] [[H935|and took]] ⟨the brothers⟩ [[H376|]] [[H3130|to Joseph’s]] [[H1004|house.]] ^4317

[[H376|But the men]] [[H3372|were frightened]] [[H3588|that]] [[H935|they had been taken]] [[H3130|to Joseph’s]] [[H1004|house.]] [[H587|“We]] [[H935|have been brought]] [[H5921|here because of]] [[H3701|the money]] [[H7725|that was returned]] [[H572|in our bags]] [[H8462|the first time,”]] [[H559|they said.]] [[H1556|“They intend]] [[H5307|to overpower]] [[H5921|us]] [[H3947|and take]] [[H853|us]] [[H5650|as slaves,]] [[H853|along with]] [[H2543|our donkeys.”]] ^4318

[[H5066|So they approached]] [[H3130|Joseph’s]] [[H376|steward]] [[H1696|and spoke]] [[H413|to him]] [[H6607|at the entrance]] [[H1004|to the house.]] ^4319

[[H994|“Please,]] [[H113|sir,”]] [[H559|they said,]] [[H3381|“we really did come down]] [[H8462|here the first time]] [[H7666|to buy]] [[H400|food.]] ^4320

[[H1961|But]] [[H3588|when]] [[H935|we came]] [[H413|to]] [[H4411|the place we stopped for the night,]] [[H6605|we opened]] [[H572|our sacks]] [[H2009|and, behold,]] [[H376|each of us]] ⟨found⟩ [[H3701|his silver]] [[H6310|in the mouth]] [[H572|of his sack!]] [[H4948|It was the full amount]] [[H3701|of our money,]] [[H7725|and we have brought it back]] [[H3027|with us.]] ^4321

[[H3381|We have brought]] [[H312|additional]] [[H3701|money]] [[H3027|with]] [[H7666|us to buy]] [[H400|food.]] [[H3808|We do not]] [[H3045|know]] [[H4310|who]] [[H7760|put]] [[H3701|our money]] [[H572|in our sacks.”]] ^4322

[[H7965|“It is fine,”]] [[H559|said the steward.]] [[H408|“Do not]] [[H3372|be afraid.]] [[H430|Your God,]] [[H430|the God]] [[H1|of your father,]] [[H5414|gave]] [[H4301|you  the treasure]] ⟨that was⟩ [[H572|in your sacks.]] [[H935|I received]] [[H3701|your money.”]] [[H8095|Then he brought Simeon]] [[H3318|out]] [[H413|to them.]] ^4323

[[H376|And the]] ⟨steward⟩ [[H935|took]] [[H376|the men]] [[H3130|into Joseph’s]] [[H1004|house,]] [[H5414|gave]] [[H4325|them water]] [[H7364|to wash]] [[H7272|their feet,]] [[H5414|and provided]] [[H4554|food]] [[H2543|for their donkeys.]] ^4324

[[H3588|Since]] ⟨the brothers⟩ [[H8085|had been told]] [[H3588|that]] [[H398|they were going to eat]] [[H3899|a meal]] [[H8033|there,]] [[H3559|they prepared]] [[H4503|their gift]] [[H5704|for]] [[H3130|Joseph’s]] [[H935|arrival]] [[H6672|at noon.]] ^4325

[[H3130|When Joseph]] [[H935|came]] [[H1004|home,]] [[H935|they presented]] [[H853|him]] [[H4503|with the gifts]] [[H3027|they had brought,]] [[H7812|and they bowed]] [[H776|to the ground before him.]] ^4326

[[H7592|He asked]] [[H7965|if they were well,]] [[H559|and then he asked,]] [[H2205|“How is your elderly]] [[H1|father]] [[H834|that]] [[H559|you told]] ⟨me about⟩? [[H5750|Is he still]] [[H2416|alive?”]] ^4327

[[H5650|“Your servant]] [[H1|our father]] [[H7965|is well,”]] [[H559|they answered.]] [[H5750|“He is still]] [[H2416|alive.”]] [[H6915|And they bowed down]] [[H7812|to honor him.]] ^4328

[[H5375|When looked up]] ⟨Joseph⟩ [[H7200|and saw]] [[H251|his brother]] [[H1144|Benjamin,]] [[H517|his own mother’s]] [[H1121|son,]] [[H559|he asked,]] [[H2088|“Is this]] [[H6996|your youngest]] [[H251|brother,]] [[H834|the one]] [[H559|you told me about?”]] [[H559|Then he declared,]] [[H430|“May God]] [[H2603|be gracious to you,]] [[H1121|my son.”]] ^4329

[[H3130|Joseph]] [[H4116|hurried]] [[H3588|out because]] [[H3648|he was moved]] [[H1245|to tears]] [[H413|for]] [[H251|his brother,]] [[H935|and he went]] [[H2315|to a private room]] [[H1058|to weep.]] ^4330

[[H7364|Then he washed]] [[H6440|his face]] [[H3318|and came back out.]] [[H662|Regaining his composure,]] [[H559|he said,]] [[H7760|“Serve]] [[H3899|the meal.”]] ^4331

[[H7760|They served]] ⟨Joseph’s⟩ [[H905|brothers]] [[H905|separately from]] [[H905|him]] [[H4713|and the Egyptians]] [[H398|who ate]] [[H854|with him,]] [[H3588|because]] [[H4713|Egyptians]] [[H3201|would]] [[H3808|not]] [[H398|eat]] [[H5680|with Hebrews,]] [[H3588|since]] [[H1931|that]] [[H8441|was detestable]] [[H4713|to them.]] ^4332

[[H3427|They were seated]] [[H6440|before him]] [[H1062|in order by age,]] [[H1060|from the firstborn]] [[H6810|to the youngest,]] [[H376|and the men]] [[H413|looked at]] [[H376|each]] [[H7453|other]] [[H8539|in astonishment.]] ^4333

[[H4864|When the portions]] [[H5375|were served]] [[H413|to them]] [[H6440|from Joseph’s table,]] [[H1144|Benjamin’s]] [[H4864|portion]] [[H2568|was five]] [[H3027|times]] [[H7235|larger than]] [[H3605|anyone else’s.]] [[H8354|So they feasted]] [[H7937|and drank freely]] [[H5973|with]] ⟨Joseph⟩. ^4334

[[H6680|Then Joseph instructed]] [[H834|his steward:]] [[H376|“Fill the men’s]] [[H572|sacks]] [[H4390|with]] [[H400|as much food]] [[H834|as]] [[H3201|they can]] [[H5375|carry,]] [[H7760|and put]] [[H376|each one’s]] [[H3701|silver]] [[H6310|in the mouth]] [[H572|of his bag.]] ^4401

[[H7760|Put]] [[H1375|my cup,]] [[H3701|the silver]] [[H1375|one,]] [[H6310|in the mouth]] [[H6996|of the youngest one’s]] [[H572|sack,]] [[H3701|along with the silver]] [[H7668|for his grain.”]] [[H6213|So did]] ⟨the steward⟩ [[H3130|as Joseph]] [[H1696|told him.]] ^4402

[[H1242|At daybreak,]] [[H582|the men]] [[H7971|were sent on their way]] [[H2543|with their donkeys.]] ^4403

[[H1992|They]] [[H3808|had not]] [[H3318|gone]] [[H7368|far]] [[H5892|from the city]] [[H3130|when Joseph]] [[H559|told]] [[H834|his steward,]] [[H7291|“Pursue]] [[H376|the men]] [[H6965|at once,]] [[H5381|and when you overtake them,]] [[H559|ask,]] [[H4100|‘Why]] [[H7999|have you repaid]] [[H2896|good]] [[H7451|with evil?]] ^4404

[[H3808|Is this not]] [[H834|the cup that]] [[H113|my master]] [[H8354|drinks from]] [[H5172|and uses for divination?]] [[H834|What]] [[H6213|you have done]] [[H7489|is wicked!’”]] ^4405

[[H5381|When overtook them,]] ⟨the steward⟩ [[H1696|he repeated]] [[H428|these]] [[H1697|words]] [[H413|to them.]] ^4406

[[H4100|“Why]] [[H113|does my lord]] [[H1696|say]] [[H428|these]] [[H1697|things?”]] [[H559|they asked.]] [[H5650|“Your servants]] [[H2486|could not possibly]] [[H6213|do]] [[H2088|such]] [[H1697|a thing.]] ^4407

[[H7725|We even brought back]] [[H413|to you]] [[H776|from the land]] [[H3667|of Canaan]] [[H3701|the money]] [[H4672|we found]] [[H6310|in the mouths]] [[H572|of our sacks.]] [[H349|Why]] [[H1589|would we steal]] [[H2091|gold]] [[H176|and]] [[H3701|silver]] [[H113|from your master’s]] [[H1004|house?]] ^4408

[[H834|If any]] [[H5650|of your servants]] [[H4672|is found]] [[H854|to have it,]] [[H4191|he must die,]] [[H587|and the rest]] [[H1961|will become]] [[H5650|slaves]] [[H113|of my lord.”]] ^4409

[[H1697|“As you say,”]] [[H559|replied the steward.]] [[H1931|“But only the one]] [[H834|who]] [[H4672|is found]] [[H854|with]] ⟨the cup⟩ [[H1961|will be]] [[H5650|my  slave,]] [[H859|and the rest of you]] [[H1961|shall be]] [[H5355|free of blame.”]] ^4410

[[H376|So each]] [[H4116|one quickly]] [[H3381|lowered]] [[H572|his sack]] [[H776|to the ground]] [[H6605|and opened]] [[H572|it.]] ^4411

[[H2664|The steward searched,]] [[H2490|beginning]] [[H1419|with the oldest]] [[H3615|and ending]] [[H6996|with the youngest—]] [[H1375|and the cup]] [[H4672|was found]] [[H1144|in Benjamin’s]] [[H572|sack.]] ^4412

[[H7167|Then they all tore]] [[H8071|their clothes,]] [[H6006|loaded]] [[H2543|their donkeys,]] [[H7725|and returned]] [[H5892|to the city.]] ^4413

[[H3063|When Judah]] [[H251|and his brothers]] [[H935|arrived at]] [[H3130|Joseph’s]] [[H1004|house,]] [[H1931|he]] [[H5750|was still]] [[H8033|there,]] [[H5307|and they fell]] [[H776|to the ground]] [[H6440|before him.]] ^4414

[[H4100|“What]] [[H2088|is this]] [[H4639|deed]] [[H6213|you have done?”]] [[H3130|Joseph]] [[H559|declared.]] [[H3808|“Did you not]] [[H3045|know]] [[H3588|that]] [[H376|a man]] [[H3644|like me]] [[H5172|can surely divine the truth?”]] ^4415

[[H4100|“What]] [[H559|can we say]] [[H113|to my lord?”]] [[H3063|Judah]] [[H559|replied.]] [[H4100|“How]] [[H1696|can we plead?]] [[H4100|How]] [[H6663|can we justify ourselves?]] [[H430|God]] [[H4672|has exposed]] [[H5771|the iniquity]] [[H5650|of your servants.]] [[H2005|We are now]] [[H113|my lord’s]] [[H5650|slaves—]] [[H1571|both]] [[H587|we]] [[H1571|and]] [[H834|the one]] [[H4672|who was found]] [[H3027|with]] [[H1375|the cup.”]] ^4416

[[H559|But Joseph replied,]] [[H2486|“Far be it from me]] [[H6213|to do]] [[H2063|this.]] [[H376|The man]] [[H834|who]] [[H4672|was found]] [[H3027|with]] [[H1375|the cup]] [[H1961|will be]] [[H5650|my slave.]] [[H859|The rest of you]] [[H5927|may return]] [[H413|to]] [[H1|your father]] [[H7965|in peace.”]] ^4417

[[H3063|Then Judah]] [[H5066|approached]] ⟨Joseph⟩ [[H413|]] [[H559|and said,]] [[H994|“Sir,]] [[H4994|please]] [[H5650|let your servant]] [[H1696|speak]] [[H113|personally to my lord.]] [[H408|Do not]] [[H2734|be angry]] [[H5650|with your servant,]] [[H3588|for]] [[H3644|you are an equal to]] [[H6547|Pharaoh.]] ^4418

[[H113|My lord]] [[H7592|asked]] [[H5650|his servants,]] [[H3426|‘Do you have]] [[H1|a father]] [[H176|or]] [[H251|a brother?’]] ^4419

[[H559|And we answered,]] [[H3426|‘We have]] [[H2205|an elderly]] [[H1|father]] [[H6996|and a younger brother,]] [[H3206|the child]] [[H2208|of his old age.]] [[H251|The boy’s brother]] [[H4191|is dead.]] [[H1931|He]] [[H905|is the only]] [[H517|one of his mother’s]] [[H3498|sons left,]] [[H1|and his father]] [[H157|loves him.’]] ^4420

[[H559|Then you told]] [[H5650|your servants,]] [[H3381|‘Bring him down]] [[H413|to me]] [[H7760|so that I can see]] [[H5921|him]] [[H5869|for myself.’]] ^4421

[[H559|So we said]] [[H413|to]] [[H113|my lord,]] [[H5288|‘The boy]] [[H3808|cannot]] [[H5800|leave]] [[H1|his father.]] [[H5800|If he were to leave,]] [[H1|his father]] [[H4191|would die.’]] ^4422

[[H559|But you said]] [[H413|to]] [[H5650|your servants,]] [[H3808|‘Unless]] [[H6996|your younger]] [[H251|brother]] [[H3381|comes down]] [[H854|with you,]] [[H3808|you will not]] [[H7200|see]] [[H6440|my face]] [[H3254|again.’]] ^4423

[[H1961|Now when]] [[H5927|we returned]] [[H413|to]] [[H5650|your servant]] [[H1|my father,]] [[H5046|we relayed]] [[H1697|your words]] [[H853|to him.]] ^4424

[[H1|Then our father]] [[H559|said,]] [[H7725|‘Go back]] [[H7666|and buy]] [[H4592|us  some]] [[H400|food.’]] ^4425

[[H559|But we answered,]] [[H3808|‘We cannot]] [[H3381|go down there]] [[H518|unless]] [[H6996|our younger]] [[H251|brother]] [[H3381|goes]] [[H854|with us.]] [[H6996|So if our younger]] [[H251|brother]] [[H369|is not]] [[H854|with us,]] [[H3808|we cannot]] [[H7200|see]] [[H376|the man.’]] ^4426

[[H5650|And your servant]] [[H1|my father]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to us,]] [[H859|‘You]] [[H3045|know]] [[H3588|that]] [[H802|my wife]] [[H3205|bore]] [[H8147|me  two sons.]] ^4427

[[H259|When one of them]] [[H3318|left]] [[H853|me,]] [[H559|I said,]] [[H389|“Surely]] [[H2963|he has been torn to pieces.”]] [[H3808|And I have not]] [[H7200|seen him]] [[H2008|since.]] ^4428

[[H3947|So if you take]] [[H2088|this one]] [[H5973|from]] [[H6440|me]] [[H1571|as well]] [[H611|and harm]] [[H7136|comes to him,]] [[H7872|you will bring my gray hair]] [[H3381|down]] [[H7585|to Sheol]] [[H7451|in sorrow.’]] ^4429

[[H6258|So]] [[H5288|if the boy]] [[H369|is not]] [[H854|with us]] [[H935|when I return]] [[H413|to]] [[H5650|your servant,]] [[H1|my father—]] [[H5315|his life]] [[H7194|is wrapped up]] [[H5315|in the boy’s life—]] ^4430

[[H7200|when he sees]] [[H3588|that]] [[H5288|the boy]] ⟨is⟩ [[H369|not]] ⟨with us⟩, [[H4191|he will die.]] [[H5650|Then your servants]] [[H7872|will have brought the gray hair]] [[H5650|of your servant]] [[H1|our father]] [[H3381|down]] [[H7585|to Sheol]] [[H3015|in sorrow.]] ^4431

[[H3588|Indeed,]] [[H5650|your servant]] [[H6148|guaranteed]] [[H5288|the boy’s safety]] [[H5973|to]] [[H1|my father,]] [[H559|saying,]] [[H518|‘If]] [[H3808|I do not]] [[H935|return]] [[H413|him to you,]] [[H3605|I will]] [[H2398|bear the guilt]] [[H1|before you, my father,]] [[H3117|all my life.’]] ^4432

[[H6258|Now]] [[H4994|please]] [[H5650|let your servant]] [[H3427|stay here]] [[H113|as my lord’s]] [[H5650|slave,]] [[H8478|in place of]] [[H5288|the boy.]] [[H5927|Let him return]] [[H5973|with]] [[H251|his brothers.]] ^4433

[[H3588|For]] [[H349|how]] [[H5927|can I go back]] [[H413|to]] [[H1|my father]] [[H369|without]] [[H5288|the boy?]] [[H6435|I could not bear]] [[H7200|to see]] [[H7451|the misery]] [[H834|that]] [[H4672|would overwhelm]] ⟨him⟩ [[H1|.”]] ^4434

[[H3130|Joseph]] [[H3201|could]] [[H3808|no longer]] [[H662|control himself]] [[H3605|before all]] [[H5324|his attendants,]] [[H7121|and he cried out,]] [[H3605|“Send everyone]] [[H3318|away]] [[H5921|from me!”]] [[H3808|So none]] ⟨of them⟩ [[H5975|were with]] ⟨Joseph⟩ [[H854|]] [[H3130|when he]] [[H3045|made himself known]] [[H413|to]] [[H251|his brothers.]] ^4501

[[H1065|But he wept]] [[H5414|so loudly]] [[H4713|that the Egyptians]] [[H6547|and Pharaoh’s]] [[H1004|household]] [[H8085|heard him.]] ^4502

[[H3130|Joseph]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H251|his brothers,]] [[H589|“I]] [[H3130|am Joseph!]] [[H1|Is my father]] [[H5750|still]] [[H2416|alive?”]] [[H251|But they]] [[H3808|were unable]] [[H6030|to answer]] [[H853|him,]] [[H3588|because]] [[H926|they were terrified]] [[H6440|in his presence.]] ^4503

[[H3130|Then Joseph]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H251|his brothers,]] [[H4994|“Please]] [[H5066|come near me.”]] [[H5066|And they]] ⟨did so⟩. [[H589|“I]] [[H3130|am Joseph,]] [[H251|your brother,”]] [[H559|he said,]] [[H834|“the one]] [[H4376|you sold]] [[H4714|into Egypt!]] ^4504

[[H6258|And now,]] [[H408|do not]] [[H6087|be distressed]] [[H2734|or angry]] [[H5869|with yourselves]] [[H3588|that]] [[H4376|you sold]] [[H853|me]] [[H2008|into this place,]] [[H3588|because]] [[H4241|it was to save lives]] [[H430|that God]] [[H7971|sent me]] [[H6440|before you.]] ^4505

[[H3588|For]] [[H7458|the famine]] [[H7130|has covered]] [[H776|the land]] [[H2088|these]] [[H8141|two years,]] [[H2568|and there will be five]] [[H5750|more]] [[H8141|years]] [[H369|without]] [[H2758|plowing]] [[H7105|or harvesting.]] ^4506

[[H430|God]] [[H7971|sent]] [[H6440|me before you]] [[H7760|to preserve]] [[H7611|you  as a remnant]] [[H776|on the earth]] [[H2421|and to save your lives]] [[H1419|by a great]] [[H6413|deliverance.]] ^4507

[[H6258|Therefore]] [[H3808|it was not]] [[H859|you]] [[H7971|who sent]] [[H2008|me here,]] [[H3588|but]] [[H430|God,]] [[H7760|who has made me]] [[H6547|Pharaoh's]] [[H1|adviser—]] [[H113|lord]] [[H3605|of all]] [[H1004|his household]] [[H4910|and ruler]] [[H3605|over all]] [[H776|the land]] [[H4714|of Egypt.]] ^4508

[[H5927|Now return]] [[H4116|quickly]] [[H413|to]] [[H1|my father]] [[H559|and tell]] [[H413|him,]] [[H3541|‘This is what]] [[H1121|your son]] [[H3130|Joseph]] [[H559|says:]] [[H430|God]] [[H7760|has made]] [[H113|me lord]] [[H3605|of all]] [[H4714|Egypt.]] [[H3381|Come down]] [[H413|to]] [[H408|me without]] [[H5975|delay.]] ^4509

[[H3427|You shall settle]] [[H776|in the land]] [[H1657|of Goshen]] [[H1961|and be]] [[H7138|near me—]] [[H859|you]] [[H1121|and your children]] [[H1121|and grandchildren,]] [[H6629|your flocks]] [[H1241|and herds,]] [[H3605|and everything you own.]] ^4510

[[H8033|And there]] [[H3557|I will provide]] [[H853|for you,]] [[H3588|because]] [[H2568|there will be five]] [[H5750|more]] [[H8141|years]] [[H7458|of famine.]] [[H6435|Otherwise,]] [[H859|you]] [[H1004|and your household]] [[H3605|and everything]] [[H3423|you own  will come to destitution.’]] ^4511

[[H2009|Behold!]] [[H5869|You]] [[H251|and my brother]] [[H1144|Benjamin]] [[H7200|can see]] [[H3588|that]] ⟨it is⟩ [[H6310|I,]] ⟨Joseph⟩, [[H1696|who am speaking]] [[H413|with you.]] ^4512

[[H5046|Tell]] [[H1|my father]] [[H3605|about all]] [[H3519|my splendor]] [[H4714|in Egypt]] [[H3605|and everything]] [[H7200|you have seen.]] [[H3381|And bring]] [[H1|my father]] [[H2008|down here]] [[H4116|quickly.”]] ^4513

[[H5307|Then Joseph threw his arms around]] [[H251|his brother]] [[H1144|Benjamin]] [[H1058|and wept,]] [[H1144|and Benjamin]] [[H1058|wept]] [[H5921|as]] [[H6677|they embraced.]] ^4514

[[H5401|Joseph kissed]] [[H3605|each]] [[H251|of his brothers]] [[H1058|as he wept]] [[H5921|over them.]] [[H310|And afterward]] [[H251|his brothers]] [[H1696|talked]] [[H854|with him.]] ^4515

[[H6963|When the news]] [[H8085|reached]] [[H6547|Pharaoh’s]] [[H1004|house]] [[H3130|that Joseph’s]] [[H251|brothers]] [[H935|had come,]] [[H6547|Pharaoh]] [[H5650|and his servants]] [[H3190|were pleased.]] ^4516

[[H6547|Pharaoh]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H3130|Joseph,]] [[H559|“Tell]] [[H251|your brothers,]] [[H6213|‘Do]] [[H2063|as follows:]] [[H2943|Load]] [[H1165|your animals]] [[H1980|and return]] [[H776|to the land]] [[H3667|of Canaan.]] ^4517

[[H3947|Then bring]] [[H1|your father]] [[H1004|and your families]] [[H935|and return]] [[H413|to me.]] [[H5414|I will give]] [[H853|you]] [[H2898|the best]] [[H776|of the land]] [[H4714|of Egypt,]] [[H398|and you shall eat]] [[H2459|from the fat]] [[H776|of the land.’]] ^4518

[[H859|You]] [[H6680|are also directed to tell them:]] [[H3947|‘Take]] [[H5699|wagons]] [[H776|from the land]] [[H4714|of Egypt]] [[H2945|for your young children]] [[H802|and your wives,]] [[H5375|and bring]] [[H1|your father]] [[H935|and come back.]] ^4519

[[H5869|But pay no regard]] [[H5921|to]] [[H3627|your belongings,]] [[H3588|for]] [[H2898|the best]] [[H3605|of all]] [[H776|the land]] [[H4714|of Egypt]] ⟨will be⟩ [[H1931|yours.’”]] ^4520

[[H1121|So the sons]] [[H3478|of Israel]] [[H6213|did]] ⟨as they were told⟩ [[H3651|.]] [[H3130|Joseph]] [[H5414|gave]] [[H5699|them wagons]] [[H5921|as]] [[H6547|Pharaoh]] [[H6310|had instructed,]] [[H5414|and he also gave]] [[H6720|them  provisions]] [[H1870|for their journey.]] ^4521

[[H5414|He gave]] [[H2487|new]] [[H8071|garments]] [[H582|to each of them,]] [[H1144|but to Benjamin]] [[H5414|he gave]] [[H7969|three]] [[H3967|hundred]] ⟨shekels⟩ [[H3701|of silver]] [[H2568|and five]] [[H2487|sets]] [[H8071|of clothes.]] ^4522

[[H7971|And he sent]] [[H1|to his father]] [[H2063|the following:]] [[H6235|ten]] [[H2543|donkeys]] [[H5375|loaded]] [[H2898|with the best]] [[H4714|of Egypt,]] [[H6235|and ten]] [[H860|female donkeys]] [[H5375|loaded]] [[H1250|with grain]] [[H3899|and bread]] [[H4202|and provisions]] [[H1|for his father’s]] [[H1870|journey.]] ^4523

[[H251|Then Joseph sent his brothers]] [[H7971|on their way,]] [[H1980|and as they were leaving,]] [[H559|he said]] [[H413|to them,]] [[H408|“Do not]] [[H7264|quarrel]] [[H1870|on the way!”]] ^4524

[[H5927|So went up]] ⟨the brothers⟩ [[H4714|out of Egypt]] [[H935|and came]] [[H413|to]] [[H1|their father]] [[H3290|Jacob]] [[H776|in the land]] [[H3667|of Canaan.]] ^4525

[[H3130|“Joseph]] [[H5750|is still]] [[H2416|alive,”]] [[H5046|they said,]] [[H3588|“and]] [[H1931|he]] [[H4910|is ruler]] [[H3605|over all]] [[H776|the land]] [[H4714|of Egypt!”]] [[H6313|But Jacob was stunned,]] [[H3588|for]] [[H3808|he did not]] [[H539|believe them.]] ^4526

[[H1696|However, when they relayed]] [[H3605|all]] [[H834|that]] [[H3130|Joseph]] [[H1696|had told]] [[H413|them,]] [[H7200|and when he saw]] [[H5699|the wagons]] [[H834|that]] [[H3130|Joseph]] [[H7971|had sent]] [[H5375|to carry]] [[H853|him back,]] [[H7307|the spirit]] [[H1|of their father]] [[H3290|Jacob]] [[H2421|was revived.]] ^4527

[[H3478|Then Israel]] [[H559|declared,]] [[H7227|“I am convinced!]] [[H1121|My son]] [[H3130|Joseph]] [[H5750|is still]] [[H2416|alive!]] [[H1980|I will go]] [[H7200|to see]] [[H2962|him before]] [[H4191|I die.”]] ^4528

[[H3478|So Israel]] [[H5265|set out]] [[H3605|with all]] [[H834|that]] [[H935|he had,  and when he came]] [[H884|to  Beersheba,]] [[H2076|he offered]] [[H2077|sacrifices]] [[H430|to the God]] [[H1|of his father]] [[H3327|Isaac.]] ^4601

[[H3915|And that night]] [[H430|God]] [[H559|spoke]] [[H3478|to Israel]] [[H4759|in a vision:]] [[H3290|“Jacob,]] [[H3290|Jacob!”]] [[H559|He said.]] [[H2009|“Here I am,”]] [[H559|replied Jacob.]] ^4602

[[H595|“I]] [[H410|am God,”]] [[H559|He said,]] [[H430|“the God]] [[H1|of your father.]] [[H408|Do not]] [[H3372|be afraid]] [[H3381|to go down]] [[H4714|to Egypt,]] [[H3588|for]] [[H7760|I will make]] [[H1419|you into a great]] [[H1471|nation]] [[H8033|there.]] ^4603

[[H595|I]] [[H3381|will go down]] [[H5973|with]] [[H4714|you to Egypt,]] [[H595|and I]] [[H1571|will surely]] [[H5927|bring you back.]] [[H3130|And Joseph’s]] [[H3027|own hands]] [[H7896|will close]] [[H5869|your eyes.”]] ^4604

[[H3290|Then Jacob]] [[H6965|departed]] [[H884|from  Beersheba,]] [[H1121|and the sons]] [[H3478|of Israel]] [[H5375|took]] [[H1|their father]] [[H3290|Jacob]] [[H5699|in the wagons]] [[H6547|Pharaoh]] [[H7971|had sent]] [[H5375|to carry him,]] [[H2945|along with their children]] [[H802|and wives.]] ^4605

[[H3947|They also took]] [[H4735|their livestock]] [[H7399|and the possessions]] [[H7408|they had acquired]] [[H776|in the land]] [[H3667|of Canaan,]] [[H3290|and Jacob]] [[H3605|and all]] [[H2233|his offspring]] [[H935|went]] [[H4714|to Egypt.]] ^4606

[[H935|He took]] [[H854|with him]] [[H4714|to Egypt]] [[H1121|his sons]] [[H1121|and grandsons,]] ⟨and⟩ [[H1323|his daughters]] [[H1323|and granddaughters—]] [[H3605|all]] [[H2233|his offspring.]] ^4607

[[H428|These]] [[H1121|are the sons]] [[H3290|of Jacob]] [[H3205|born]] [[H1090|to Bilhah,]] [[H834|whom]] [[H3837|Laban]] [[H5414|gave]] [[H1323|to his daughter]] [[H7354|Rachel—]] [[H7651|seven]] [[H5315|in all.]] ^4625

[[H3605|All those]] [[H3290|belonging to Jacob]] [[H935|who came]] [[H4714|to Egypt—]] [[H3318|his direct descendants,]] [[H905|besides]] [[H802|the wives]] [[H3290|of Jacob’s]] [[H1121|sons—]] ⟨numbered⟩ [[H8346|sixty-six]] [[H5315|persons.]] ^4626

[[H3130|And along with Joseph’s]] [[H8147|two]] [[H1121|sons]] [[H834|who]] [[H3205|were born]] [[H4714|to him  in Egypt,]] [[H3605|in all]] [[H935|there were]] [[H7657|seventy]] [[H5315|members]] [[H3290|of Jacob’s]] [[H1004|household]] [[H4714|in Egypt.]] ^4627

[[H7971|Now Jacob had sent]] [[H3063|Judah]] [[H6440|ahead of]] [[H413|him to]] [[H3130|Joseph]] [[H3384|to get directions]] [[H1657|to Goshen.]] [[H935|When arrived]] ⟨Jacob’s family⟩ [[H776|in the land]] [[H1657|of Goshen,]] ^4628

[[H3130|Joseph]] [[H631|prepared]] [[H4818|his chariot]] [[H5927|and went]] ⟨there⟩ [[H1657|]] [[H7125|to meet]] [[H1|his father]] [[H3478|Israel.]] [[H7200|Joseph presented]] [[H413|himself to him,]] [[H5307|embraced]] [[H6677|him,]] [[H1058|and wept]] [[H5750|profusely.]] ^4629

[[H3478|Then Israel]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H3130|Joseph,]] [[H4191|“Finally I can die,]] [[H6471|now]] [[H7200|that I have seen]] [[H6440|your face]] ⟨and know⟩ [[H3588|that]] [[H5750|you are still]] [[H2416|alive!”]] ^4630

[[H3130|Joseph]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H251|his brothers]] [[H413|and to]] [[H1|his father’s]] [[H1004|household,]] [[H5927|“I will go up]] [[H5046|and inform]] [[H6547|Pharaoh:]] [[H251|‘My brothers]] [[H1|and my father’s]] [[H1004|household]] [[H776|from the land]] [[H3667|of Canaan]] [[H935|have come]] [[H413|to me.]] ^4631

[[H582|The men]] [[H7462|are shepherds;]] [[H4735|they raise livestock,]] [[H935|and they have brought]] [[H6629|their flocks]] [[H1241|and herds]] [[H3605|and all]] [[H834|that]] ^4632

[[H3588|When]] [[H6547|Pharaoh]] [[H7121|summons]] [[H559|you  and asks,]] [[H4100|‘What]] [[H4639|is your occupation?’]] ^4633

[[H559|you are to say,]] [[H5650|‘Your servants]] [[H4735|have raised livestock]] [[H5271|ever since our youth—]] [[H1571|both]] [[H587|we]] [[H1571|and]] [[H1|our fathers.’]] [[H5668|Then]] [[H3427|you will be allowed to settle]] [[H776|in the land]] [[H1657|of Goshen,]] [[H3588|since]] [[H3605|all]] [[H7462|shepherds]] [[H8441|are detestable]] [[H4713|to the Egyptians.”]] ^4634

[[H3130|So Joseph]] [[H935|went]] [[H5046|and told]] [[H6547|Pharaoh:]] [[H1|“My father]] [[H251|and my brothers,]] [[H6629|with their flocks]] [[H1241|and herds]] [[H3605|and all]] [[H834|they own,]] [[H935|have come]] [[H776|from the land]] [[H3667|of Canaan]] [[H2005|and are now]] [[H1657|in Goshen.”]] ^4701

[[H3947|And he chose]] [[H2568|five]] [[H582|of]] [[H251|his brothers]] [[H3322|and presented]] [[H6440|them before]] [[H6547|Pharaoh.]] ^4702

[[H4100|“What]] [[H4639|is your occupation?”]] [[H6547|Pharaoh]] [[H559|asked]] ⟨Joseph’s⟩ [[H251|brothers.]] [[H5650|“Your servants]] [[H7462|are shepherds,”]] [[H559|they replied,]] [[H1571|“both]] [[H587|we]] [[H1571|and]] [[H1|our fathers.”]] ^4703

[[H559|Then they said]] [[H413|to]] [[H6547|Pharaoh,]] [[H935|“We have come]] [[H776|to live in the land]] [[H1481|for a time,]] [[H3588|because]] [[H369|there is no]] [[H4829|pasture]] [[H6629|for the flock]] [[H5650|of your servants,]] [[H3588|since]] [[H7458|the famine]] [[H776|in the land]] [[H3667|of Canaan]] [[H3515|has been severe.]] [[H6258|So now,]] [[H4994|please]] [[H5650|allow your servants]] [[H3427|to settle]] [[H776|in the land]] [[H1657|of Goshen.]] ^4704

[[H6547|Pharaoh]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H3130|Joseph,]] [[H1|“Now that your father]] [[H251|and brothers]] [[H935|have come]] [[H413|to you,]] ^4705

[[H3130|Then Joseph]] [[H935|brought in]] [[H1|his father]] [[H3290|Jacob]] [[H5975|and presented]] [[H6440|him before]] [[H6547|Pharaoh,]] [[H3290|and Jacob]] [[H1288|blessed]] [[H6547|Pharaoh.]] ^4707

[[H4100|“How many]] [[H3117|years]] [[H2416|have you lived?”]] [[H6547|Pharaoh]] [[H559|asked.]] ^4708

[[H3130|So Joseph]] [[H3427|settled]] [[H1|his father]] [[H251|and brothers]] [[H776|in the land]] [[H4714|of Egypt]] [[H272|and gave them  property]] [[H4315|in the best]] [[H776|part of the land,]] [[H776|the district]] [[H7486|of Rameses,]] [[H834|as]] [[H6547|Pharaoh]] [[H6680|had commanded.]] ^4711

[[H3130|Joseph also]] [[H3557|provided]] [[H1|his father]] [[H853|and]] [[H251|brothers]] [[H3605|and all]] [[H1|his father’s]] [[H1004|household]] [[H3899|with food]] [[H6310|for]] ⟨their⟩ [[H2945|families.]] ^4712

[[H369|Yet there was no]] [[H3899|food]] [[H3605|throughout]] [[H776|that region,]] [[H3588|because]] [[H7458|the famine]] [[H3966|was so]] [[H3515|severe;]] [[H776|the lands]] [[H4714|of Egypt]] [[H776|and]] [[H3667|Canaan]] [[H3856|had been exhausted]] [[H6440|by]] [[H7458|the famine.]] ^4713

[[H3130|Joseph]] [[H3950|collected]] [[H3605|all]] [[H3701|the money]] [[H4672|to be found]] [[H776|in the land]] [[H4714|of Egypt]] [[H776|and the land]] [[H3667|of Canaan]] [[H7668|in exchange for the grain]] [[H1992|they]] [[H7666|were buying,]] [[H3130|and he]] [[H935|brought]] ⟨it⟩ [[H3701|]] [[H6547|into Pharaoh’s]] [[H1004|palace.]] ^4714

[[H3701|When the money]] [[H776|from the lands]] [[H4714|of Egypt]] [[H776|and]] [[H3667|Canaan]] [[H8552|was gone,]] [[H3605|all]] [[H4713|the Egyptians]] [[H935|came]] [[H413|to]] [[H3130|Joseph]] [[H559|and said,]] [[H3051|“Give]] [[H3899|us  food.]] [[H4100|Why]] [[H4191|should we die]] [[H5048|before your eyes?]] [[H3588|For]] [[H3701|our funds]] [[H656|have run out!]] ^4715

[[H3051|“Then bring me]] [[H4735|your livestock,”]] [[H559|said]] [[H3130|Joseph.]] [[H518|“Since]] [[H3701|the money]] [[H656|is gone,]] [[H5414|I will sell]] [[H4735|you food  in exchange for your livestock.”]] ^4716

[[H935|So they brought]] [[H4735|their livestock]] [[H413|to]] [[H3130|Joseph,]] [[H3130|and he]] [[H5414|gave]] [[H3899|them  food]] [[H5483|in exchange for their horses,]] [[H4735|the animals]] [[H6629|of their flocks]] [[H1241|and herds,]] [[H2543|and their donkeys.]] [[H1931|Throughout that]] [[H8141|year]] [[H5095|he provided]] [[H3899|them with food]] [[H3605|in exchange for all]] [[H4735|their livestock.]] ^4717

[[H1931|When that]] [[H8141|year]] [[H8552|was over,]] [[H935|they came]] [[H8145|to him  the next]] [[H8141|year]] [[H559|and said,]] [[H3808|“We cannot]] [[H3582|hide]] [[H113|from our lord]] [[H3588|that]] [[H3701|our money]] [[H8552|is gone]] [[H4735|and all our livestock]] [[H413|belongs to]] ⟨you⟩ [[H113|.]] [[H3808|There is nothing]] [[H7604|left]] [[H6440|for]] [[H113|our lord]] [[H1115|except]] [[H1472|our bodies]] [[H127|and our land.]] ^4718

[[H4100|Why]] [[H4191|should we perish]] [[H5869|before your eyes—]] [[H587|we]] [[H1571|and]] [[H127|our land]] [[H1571|as well?]] [[H7069|Purchase]] [[H853|us]] [[H853|and]] [[H127|our land]] [[H3899|in exchange for food.]] [[H587|Then we,]] [[H127|along with our land,]] [[H1961|will be]] [[H5650|slaves]] [[H6547|to Pharaoh.]] [[H5414|Give]] [[H2233|us seed]] [[H2421|that we may live]] [[H3808|and not]] [[H4191|die,]] [[H127|and that the land]] [[H3808|may not]] [[H3456|become desolate.]] ^4719

[[H3130|So Joseph]] [[H7069|acquired]] [[H6547|for Pharaoh]] [[H3605|all]] [[H127|the land]] [[H4714|in Egypt;]] [[H4713|the Egyptians,]] [[H582|one and all,]] [[H4376|sold]] [[H7704|their fields]] [[H3588|because]] [[H7458|the famine]] [[H2388|was so severe]] [[H5921|upon them.]] [[H776|The land]] [[H1961|became Pharaoh’s,]] ^4720

[[H5674|and Joseph reduced]] [[H5971|the people]] [[H5892|to servitude]] [[H7097|from one end]] [[H4714|of Egypt]] [[H5704|to]] [[H7097|the other.]] ^4721

[[H7535|However,]] [[H3808|he did not]] [[H7069|acquire]] [[H3548|the priests’ portion]] [[H127|of the land,]] [[H3588|for]] [[H6547|it had been given to them by Pharaoh.]] [[H398|They lived off]] [[H2706|the rations that]] [[H6547|Pharaoh]] [[H5414|supplied;]] [[H5921|so]] [[H3808|they did not]] [[H4376|sell]] [[H127|their land.]] ^4722

[[H3130|Then Joseph]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H5971|the people,]] [[H2005|“Now that]] [[H7069|I have acquired]] [[H127|you and your land]] [[H6547|for Pharaoh]] [[H3117|this day,]] [[H1887|here]] [[H2233|is seed]] [[H2232|for you  to sow]] [[H127|in the land.]] ^4723

[[H8393|At harvest time,]] [[H5414|you are to give]] [[H2549|a fifth]] [[H6547|of it to Pharaoh,]] [[H702|and four-fifths]] [[H1961|will be]] [[H2233|yours  as seed]] [[H7704|for the field]] [[H400|and food for yourselves]] [[H1004|and your households]] [[H2945|and children.”]] ^4724

[[H2421|“You have saved our lives,”]] [[H559|they said.]] [[H4672|“We have found]] [[H2580|favor]] [[H113|in our lord’s]] [[H5869|eyes,]] [[H1961|and will be]] [[H6547|Pharaoh’s]] [[H5650|servants.”]] ^4725

[[H3130|So Joseph]] [[H7760|established]] [[H2706|a law]] [[H2569|that a fifth]] [[H6547|of the produce belongs to Pharaoh,]] [[H5704|and it is in effect]] [[H5921|in]] [[H127|the land]] [[H4714|of Egypt]] [[H2088|to this]] [[H3117|day.]] [[H7535|Only]] [[H3548|the priests’]] [[H127|land]] [[H3808|does not]] [[H1961|belong to]] [[H6547|Pharaoh.]] ^4726

[[H3478|Thus the Israelites]] [[H3427|settled]] [[H776|in the land]] [[H4714|of Egypt,]] [[H776|in the region]] [[H1657|of Goshen.]] [[H270|They acquired property]] [[H6509|there  and became fruitful]] [[H3966|and increased greatly]] [[H7235|in number.]] ^4727

[[H3290|And Jacob]] [[H2421|lived]] [[H776|in the land]] [[H4714|of Egypt]] [[H6240|seventeen]] [[H8141|years,]] [[H8141|and the length of his life]] [[H1961|was]] [[H3967|147]] [[H8141|years.]] ^4728

[[H3117|When the time]] [[H7126|drew near]] [[H3478|for Israel]] [[H4191|to die,]] [[H7121|he called]] [[H1121|his son]] [[H3130|Joseph]] [[H559|and said,]] [[H518|“If]] [[H4672|I have found]] [[H2580|favor]] [[H5869|in your eyes,]] [[H7760|put]] [[H3027|your hand]] [[H8478|under]] [[H3409|my thigh]] [[H6213|and promise me that you will show]] [[H5978|me]] [[H2617|kindness]] [[H571|and faithfulness.]] [[H408|Do not]] [[H6912|bury me]] [[H4714|in Egypt,]] ^4729

[[H7901|but when I lie down]] [[H5973|with]] [[H1|my fathers,]] [[H5375|carry me]] [[H4714|out of Egypt]] [[H6912|and bury me]] [[H6900|with them.”]] [[H559|Joseph answered,]] [[H595|“I]] [[H6213|will do]] [[H1697|as you have requested.”]] ^4730

[[H7650|“Swear]] [[H559|to me,”  Jacob said.]] [[H7650|So Joseph swore]] [[H3478|to him,  and Israel]] [[H7812|bowed]] [[H5921|in worship at]] [[H7218|the head]] [[H4296|of his bed.]] ^4731

[[H310|Some time later,]] [[H3130|Joseph]] [[H559|was told,]] [[H1|“Your father]] [[H2470|is ill.”]] [[H3947|So he set out]] [[H5973|with]] [[H8147|his two]] [[H1121|sons,]] [[H4519|Manasseh]] [[H669|and Ephraim.]] ^4801

[[H3290|When Jacob]] [[H5046|was told,]] [[H1121|“Your son]] [[H3130|Joseph]] [[H935|has come]] [[H413|to you,”]] [[H3478|Israel]] [[H2388|rallied his strength]] [[H3427|and sat up]] [[H5921|in]] [[H4296|bed.]] ^4802

[[H3290|Jacob]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H3130|Joseph,]] [[H410|“God]] [[H7706|Almighty]] [[H7200|appeared]] [[H413|to]] [[H3870|me at Luz]] [[H776|in the land]] [[H3667|of Canaan,]] [[H1288|and there He blessed]] [[H853|me]] ^4803

[[H589|Now as for me,]] [[H935|when I was returning]] [[H6307|from Paddan,]] [[H5921|to my sorrow]] [[H7354|Rachel]] [[H4191|died]] [[H1870|along the way]] [[H776|in the land]] [[H3667|of Canaan,]] [[H3530|some distance]] [[H672|from Ephrath.]] [[H6912|So I buried]] [[H8033|her there]] [[H1870|beside the road]] [[H672|to Ephrath”]] [[H1931|(that]] ⟨is⟩ [[H1035|,  Bethlehem).]] ^4807

[[H3478|When Israel]] [[H7200|saw]] [[H1121|the sons]] [[H3130|of Joseph,]] [[H559|he asked,]] [[H4310|“Who]] [[H428|are these?”]] ^4808

[[H3130|Joseph]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H1|his father,]] [[H1992|“They]] [[H1121|are the sons]] [[H430|God]] [[H5414|has given]] [[H2088|me  in this.”]] ⟨place⟩ [[H559|So Jacob said,]] [[H4994|“Please]] [[H3947|bring them]] [[H413|to me,]] [[H1288|that I may bless.”]] ⟨them⟩ ^4809

[[H3478|Now Israel’s]] [[H5869|eyesight]] [[H3513|was poor]] [[H2207|because of old age;]] [[H3201|he could]] [[H3808|hardly]] [[H7200|see.]] [[H5066|Joseph brought]] ⟨his sons⟩ [[H413|to him,]] [[H5401|and kissed]] ⟨his father⟩ [[H2263|them  and embraced]] ^4810

[[H3808|“I never]] [[H6419|expected]] [[H7200|to see]] [[H6440|your face again,”]] [[H3478|Israel]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H3130|Joseph,]] [[H2009|“but now]] [[H430|God]] [[H7200|has let me see]] [[H2233|your children]] [[H1571|as well.”]] ^4811

[[H3130|Then Joseph]] [[H3318|took]] [[H5973|them from]] [[H1290|his father’s knees]] [[H7812|and bowed down]] [[H639|with his face]] [[H776|to the ground.]] ^4812
