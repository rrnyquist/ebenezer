[[H3117|In the days]] [[H8199|when the judges]] [[H8199|ruled,]] [[H1961|there was]] [[H7458|a famine]] [[H776|in the land.]] [[H376|And a certain man]] [[H1035|from  Bethlehem]] [[H3063|in Judah,]] [[H802|with his wife]] [[H8147|and two]] [[H1121|sons,]] [[H1980|went]] [[H1481|to reside]] [[H7704|in the land]] [[H4124|of Moab.]] ^0101

[[H376|The man’s]] [[H8034|name]] [[H458|was Elimelech,]] [[H802|his wife’s]] [[H8034|name]] [[H5281|was Naomi,]] [[H8034|and the names]] [[H8147|of his two]] [[H1121|sons]] [[H4248|were Mahlon]] [[H3630|and Chilion.]] [[H673|They were Ephrathites]] [[H1035|from  Bethlehem]] [[H3063|in Judah,]] [[H935|and they entered]] [[H7704|the land]] [[H4124|of Moab]] [[H1961|and settled]] [[H8033|there.]] ^0102

[[H5281|Then Naomi’s]] [[H376|husband]] [[H458|Elimelech]] [[H4191|died,]] [[H1931|and she]] [[H7604|was left]] [[H8147|with her two]] [[H1121|sons,]] ^0103

[[H5375|who took]] [[H4125|Moabite]] [[H802|women as their wives,]] [[H259|one]] [[H8034|named]] [[H6204|Orpah]] [[H8145|and the other]] [[H8034|named]] [[H7327|Ruth.]] [[H3427|And after they had lived]] [[H8033|in Moab]] [[H6235|about ten]] [[H8141|years,]] ^0104

[[H8147|both]] [[H4248|Mahlon]] [[H3630|and Chilion]] [[H1571|also]] [[H4191|died,]] [[H802|and Naomi]] [[H7604|was left]] [[H8147|without her two]] [[H3206|sons]] [[H376|and without her husband.]] ^0105

[[H3588|When]] ⟨Naomi⟩ [[H8085|heard]] [[H4124|in Moab]] [[H3588|that]] [[H3069|the LORD]] [[H6485|had attended to]] [[H5971|His people]] [[H5414|by providing]] [[H3899|them  with food,]] [[H1931|she]] [[H3618|and her daughters-in-law]] [[H6965|prepared]] [[H7725|to leave]] [[H7704|the land]] [[H4124|of Moab.]] ^0106

[[H3318|So she left]] [[H4725|the place]] [[H834|where]] [[H1961|she was,]] [[H5973|accompanied]] [[H8147|by her two]] [[H3618|daughters-in-law,]] [[H1980|and set out]] [[H1870|on the road]] [[H7725|leading back]] [[H413|to]] [[H776|the land]] [[H3063|of Judah.]] ^0107

[[H5281|Then Naomi]] [[H559|said]] [[H8147|to her two]] [[H3618|daughters-in-law,]] [[H1980|“Go]] [[H7725|back,]] [[H802|each of you]] [[H517|to your mother’s]] [[H1004|home.]] [[H3068|May the LORD]] [[H6213|show]] [[H5973|you]] [[H2617|loving devotion,]] [[H834|as]] [[H6213|you have shown]] [[H5973|to]] [[H4191|your dead]] [[H5973|and to me.]] ^0108

[[H3068|May the LORD]] [[H5414|enable]] [[H802|each of you]] [[H4672|to find]] [[H4496|security]] [[H1004|in the home]] [[H376|of your new husband.”]] [[H5401|And she kissed]] [[H1058|them  as they wept]] [[H5375|aloud]] ^0109

[[H559|and said,]] [[H3588|“Surely]] [[H7725|we will return]] [[H854|with you]] [[H5971|to your people.”]] ^0110

[[H5281|But Naomi]] [[H559|replied,]] [[H7725|“Return home,]] [[H1323|my daughters.]] [[H4100|Why]] [[H1980|would you go]] [[H5973|with me?]] ⟨Are⟩ [[H5750|there still]] [[H1121|sons]] [[H4578|in my womb]] [[H1961|to become]] [[H376|your husbands?]] ^0111

[[H7663|would you wait]] [[H3860|for them]] [[H5704|to]] [[H1431|grow up?]] [[H5702|Would you refrain]] [[H1115|from]] [[H1961|having]] [[H376|husbands?]] [[H408|No,]] [[H1323|my daughters,]] [[H4843|it grieves]] [[H3966|me  very much]] [[H4480|for]] [[H3588|your sakes that]] [[H3027|the hand]] [[H3068|of the LORD]] [[H3318|has gone out]] ^0113

[[H5750|Again]] [[H1058|they wept]] [[H5375|aloud,]] [[H6204|and Orpah]] [[H5401|kissed]] [[H2545|her mother-in-law]] ⟨goodbye⟩, [[H7327|but Ruth]] [[H1692|clung]] ^0114

[[H2009|“Look,”]] [[H559|said Naomi,]] [[H2994|“your sister-in-law]] [[H7725|has gone back]] [[H413|to]] [[H5971|her people]] [[H413|and]] [[H430|her gods;]] [[H7725|follow]] ⟨her⟩ [[H310|back home.”]] ^0115

[[H7327|But Ruth]] [[H559|replied:]] [[H408|“Do not]] [[H6293|urge]] [[H5800|me  to leave you]] ⟨or⟩ [[H7725|to turn]] [[H310|from following you.]] [[H3588|For]] [[H413|wherever]] [[H1980|you go,]] [[H1980|I will go,]] [[H834|and wherever]] [[H3885|you live,]] [[H3885|I will live;]] [[H5971|your people]] [[H5971|will be my people,]] [[H430|and your God]] [[H430|will be my God.]] ^0116

[[H834|Where]] [[H4191|you die,]] [[H4191|I will die,]] [[H8033|and there]] [[H6912|I will be buried.]] [[H3068|May the LORD]] [[H3541|punish]] [[H6213|me,]] [[H3541|and ever so]] [[H3254|severely,]] [[H3588|if]] [[H4194|anything but death]] [[H6504|separates]] [[H996|you]] [[H996|and me.”]] ^0117

[[H7200|When Naomi saw]] [[H3588|that]] [[H1931|Ruth]] [[H553|was determined]] [[H1980|to go]] [[H854|with her,]] [[H2308|she stopped]] [[H1696|trying to persuade her.]] ^0118

[[H8147|So]] ⟨Naomi and Ruth⟩ [[H1980|traveled]] [[H5704|until]] [[H935|they came]] [[H1035|to  Bethlehem.]] [[H1961|When they]] [[H935|entered]] [[H1035|Bethlehem,]] [[H3605|the whole]] [[H5892|city]] [[H1949|was stirred]] [[H5921|because of them,]] [[H559|and the women exclaimed,]] ⟨of the city⟩ [[H2063|“Can this]] [[H5281|be Naomi?”]] ^0119

[[H408|“Do not]] [[H7121|call]] [[H5281|me Naomi,”]] [[H559|she replied.]] [[H7121|“Call]] [[H4755|me Mara,]] [[H3588|because]] [[H7706|the Almighty]] [[H4843|has dealt quite bitterly]] ^0120

[[H589|I]] [[H1980|went away]] [[H4390|full,]] [[H3068|but the LORD]] [[H7725|has brought me back]] [[H7387|empty.]] [[H4100|Why]] [[H7121|call]] [[H5281|me Naomi,]] [[H3068|since the LORD]] [[H6030|has testified]] [[H7706|against me,  and the Almighty]] [[H7489|has afflicted]] ^0121

[[H5281|So Naomi]] [[H7725|returned]] [[H7704|from the land]] [[H4124|of Moab]] [[H5973|with]] [[H3618|her daughter-in-law]] [[H7327|Ruth]] [[H4125|the Moabitess.]] [[H1992|And they]] [[H935|arrived]] [[H1035|in Bethlehem]] [[H8462|at the beginning]] [[H8184|of the barley]] [[H7105|harvest.]] ^0122

[[H5281|Now Naomi]] [[H3045|had a relative]] [[H376|on her husband’s side,]] [[H1368|a prominent]] [[H376|man]] [[H2428|of noble character]] [[H4940|from the clan]] [[H458|of Elimelech,]] [[H8034|whose name]] ⟨was⟩ [[H1162|Boaz.]] ^0201

[[H7327|And Ruth]] [[H4125|the Moabitess]] [[H559|said]] [[H5281|to Naomi,]] [[H4994|“Please]] [[H1980|let me go]] [[H7704|into the fields]] [[H3950|and glean]] [[H7641|heads of grain]] [[H310|behind]] ⟨someone⟩ [[H834|in whose]] [[H5869|sight]] [[H4672|I may find]] [[H2580|favor.”]] [[H1980|“Go ahead,]] [[H1323|my daughter,”]] [[H559|Naomi replied.]] ^0202

[[H1980|So Ruth departed]] [[H935|and went out]] [[H7704|into the field]] [[H3950|and gleaned]] [[H310|after]] [[H7114|the harvesters.]] [[H7136|And she happened]] [[H4745|to come]] [[H2513|to the part]] [[H7704|of the field]] ⟨belonging⟩ [[H1162|to Boaz,]] [[H834|who]] ⟨was⟩ [[H4940|from the clan]] [[H458|of Elimelech.]] ^0203

[[H2009|Just then]] [[H1162|Boaz]] [[H935|arrived]] [[H1035|from  Bethlehem]] [[H559|and said]] [[H7114|to the harvesters,]] [[H3068|“The LORD]] [[H5973|be with you.”]] [[H3068|“The LORD]] [[H1288|bless you,”]] [[H559|they replied.]] ^0204

[[H1162|And Boaz]] [[H559|asked]] [[H5288|the foreman]] [[H5921|of]] [[H7114|his harvesters,]] [[H4310|“Whose]] [[H5291|young woman]] [[H2063|is this?”]] ^0205

[[H5288|The foreman]] [[H6030|answered,]] [[H1931|“She]] ⟨is⟩ [[H4125|the Moabitess]] [[H7725|who returned]] [[H5973|with]] [[H5281|Naomi]] [[H7704|from the land]] [[H4124|of Moab.]] ^0206

[[H559|She has said,]] [[H4994|‘Please]] [[H3950|let me glean]] [[H622|and gather]] [[H6016|among the sheaves]] [[H310|behind]] [[H7114|the harvesters.’]] [[H935|So she came out]] [[H5975|and has continued]] [[H227|from]] [[H1242|morning]] [[H5704|until]] [[H6258|now,]] [[H2088|except]] [[H3427|that she rested]] [[H4592|a short time]] [[H1004|in the shelter.”]] ^0207

[[H1162|Then Boaz]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H7327|Ruth,]] [[H8085|“Listen,]] [[H1323|my daughter.]] [[H408|Do not]] [[H1980|go]] [[H3950|and glean]] [[H312|in another]] [[H7704|field,]] [[H1571|and]] [[H3808|do not]] [[H5674|go away]] [[H2088|from this]] ⟨place⟩, [[H3541|but stay here]] [[H1692|close]] [[H5973|to]] [[H5291|my servant girls.]] ^0208

⟨Let⟩ [[H5869|your eyes]] ⟨be on⟩ ⟨the⟩ [[H834|]] [[H7704|field]] [[H7114|they are harvesting,]] [[H1980|and follow along]] [[H310|after]] ⟨these girls⟩. [[H3808|Indeed,]] [[H6680|I have ordered]] [[H5288|the young men]] [[H1115|not]] [[H5060|to touch you.]] [[H6770|And when you are thirsty,]] [[H1980|go]] [[H8354|and drink]] [[H834|from]] [[H3627|the jars]] [[H5288|the young men]] [[H7579|have filled.”]] ^0209

[[H5307|At this, she fell]] [[H5921|on]] [[H6440|her face,]] [[H7812|bowing low]] [[H776|to the ground,]] [[H559|and said]] [[H413|to him,]] [[H4069|“Why]] [[H4672|have I found]] [[H2580|such favor]] [[H5869|in your eyes]] [[H5234|that you should take notice of me,]] [[H595|even though I]] ⟨am⟩ [[H5237|a foreigner?”]] ^0210

[[H1162|Boaz]] [[H6030|replied,]] [[H5046|“I have been made fully aware]] [[H3605|of all]] [[H6213|you have done]] [[H854|for]] [[H2545|your mother-in-law]] [[H310|since]] [[H4194|the death]] [[H376|of your husband,]] [[H5800|how you left]] [[H1|your father]] [[H517|and mother]] [[H776|and the land]] [[H4138|of your birth,]] [[H1980|and how you came]] [[H413|to]] [[H5971|a people]] [[H3808|you did not]] [[H3045|know]] [[H8543|before.]] ^0211

[[H3068|May the LORD]] [[H7999|repay]] [[H6467|your work,]] [[H1961|and may you receive]] [[H8003|a rich]] [[H4909|reward]] [[H5973|from]] [[H3068|the LORD,]] [[H430|the God]] [[H3478|of Israel,]] [[H8478|under]] [[H834|whose]] [[H3671|wings]] [[H935|you have taken]] [[H2620|refuge.”]] ^0212

[[H113|“My lord,”]] [[H559|she said,]] [[H4672|“may I continue to find]] [[H2580|favor]] [[H5869|in your eyes,]] [[H3588|for]] [[H5162|you have comforted]] [[H1696|and spoken]] [[H3820|kindly]] [[H5921|to]] [[H8198|your maidservant,]] [[H595|though I]] [[H1961|am]] [[H3808|not]] [[H259|like one]] [[H8198|of your servant girls.”]] ^0213

[[H6256|At mealtime]] [[H1162|Boaz]] [[H559|said]] [[H5066|to her,  “Come over]] [[H1988|here;]] [[H398|have]] [[H4480|some]] [[H3899|bread]] [[H2881|and dip]] [[H6595|it]] [[H2558|into the vinegar sauce.”]] [[H3427|So she sat down]] [[H6654|beside]] [[H7114|the harvesters,]] [[H6642|and he offered]] [[H7039|her  roasted grain,]] [[H398|and she ate]] [[H7646|and was satisfied]] [[H3498|and had some left over.]] ^0214

[[H6965|When got up]] ⟨Ruth⟩ [[H3950|to glean,]] [[H1162|Boaz]] [[H6680|ordered]] [[H5288|his young men,]] [[H1571|“Even if]] [[H3950|she gathers]] [[H996|among]] [[H6016|the sheaves,]] [[H3808|do not]] [[H3637|insult her.]] ^0215

[[H1571|Rather,]] [[H7997|pull out]] [[H4480|for her from]] ⟨some stalks⟩ [[H6653|the bundles]] [[H5800|and leave]] [[H3950|them for her to gather.]] [[H3808|Do not]] [[H1605|rebuke]] ^0216

[[H3950|So Ruth gathered grain]] [[H7704|in the field]] [[H5704|until]] [[H6153|evening.]] [[H2251|And when she beat out]] [[H834|what]] [[H3950|she had gleaned,]] [[H1961|it was]] [[H374|about an ephah]] [[H8184|of barley.]] ^0217

[[H5375|She picked up the grain]] [[H935|and went into]] [[H5892|the town,]] [[H2545|where her mother-in-law]] [[H7200|saw]] [[H834|what]] [[H3950|she had gleaned.]] [[H3318|And she brought out]] [[H834|what]] [[H3498|she had saved]] [[H7648|from her meal]] [[H5414|and gave it]] ^0218

[[H2545|Then her mother-in-law]] [[H559|asked]] [[H375|her,  “Where]] [[H3950|did you glean]] [[H3117|today,]] [[H575|and where]] [[H6213|did you work?]] [[H1288|Blessed]] [[H1961|be]] ⟨the man⟩ [[H5234|who noticed you.”]] [[H5046|So she told]] [[H2545|her mother-in-law]] [[H834|where]] [[H6213|she had worked.]] [[H8034|“The name]] [[H376|of the man]] [[H6213|I worked]] [[H5973|with]] [[H3117|today]] [[H1162|is Boaz,”]] [[H559|she said.]] ^0219

[[H5281|Then Naomi]] [[H559|said]] [[H3618|to her daughter-in-law,]] [[H1931|“May he]] [[H1288|be blessed]] [[H3068|by the LORD,]] [[H834|who]] [[H3808|has not]] [[H5800|withdrawn]] [[H2617|his kindness]] [[H854|from]] [[H2416|the living]] [[H4191|or the dead.”]] [[H5281|Naomi]] [[H559|continued,]] [[H376|“The man]] [[H7138|is a close relative.]] [[H1931|He]] ⟨is⟩ [[H1350|one of our  kinsman-redeemers.”]] ^0220

[[H7327|Then Ruth]] [[H4125|the Moabitess]] [[H559|said,]] [[H1571|“He also]] [[H559|told me,]] [[H1692|‘Stay]] [[H5973|with]] [[H5288|my young men]] [[H5704|until]] [[H3615|they have finished gathering]] [[H3605|all]] [[H7105|my  harvest.’”]] ^0221

[[H5281|And Naomi]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H3618|her daughter-in-law]] [[H7327|Ruth,]] [[H1323|“My daughter,]] [[H2896|it is good]] [[H3318|for you to work]] [[H5973|with]] [[H5291|his young women,]] [[H3808|so that nothing]] [[H6293|will happen]] [[H312|to you  in another]] [[H7704|field.”]] ^0222

[[H1692|So Ruth stayed close]] [[H5291|to the servant girls]] [[H1162|of Boaz]] [[H3950|to glean]] [[H5704|grain until]] [[H8184|the barley]] [[H2406|and wheat]] [[H7105|harvests]] [[H3615|were finished.]] [[H3427|And she lived]] [[H854|with]] [[H2545|her mother-in-law.]] ^0223

[[H2545|One day Ruth’s mother-in-law]] [[H5281|Naomi]] [[H559|said to her,]] [[H1323|“My daughter,]] [[H3808|should I not]] [[H1245|seek]] [[H4494|a place]] [[H834|for you,  that]] [[H3190|it may be well]] ^0301

[[H6258|Now]] [[H3808|is not]] [[H1162|Boaz,]] [[H834|with whose]] [[H5291|servant girls]] [[H1961|you have been]] ⟨working⟩, [[H4130|a relative of ours?]] [[H2009|In fact,]] [[H3915|tonight]] [[H1931|he]] [[H2219|is winnowing]] [[H8184|barley]] [[H1637|on the threshing floor.]] ^0302

[[H7364|Therefore wash yourself,]] [[H5480|put on perfume,]] [[H7760|and wear]] [[H8071|your best clothes.]] [[H3381|Go down]] [[H1637|to the threshing floor,]] [[H408|but do not]] [[H376|let the man]] [[H3045|know]] [[H5704|you are there until]] [[H3615|he has finished]] [[H398|eating]] [[H8354|and drinking.]] ^0303

[[H7901|When he lies down,]] [[H3045|note]] [[H4725|the place]] [[H834|where]] [[H7901|he lies.]] [[H935|Then go in]] [[H1540|and uncover]] [[H4772|his feet,]] [[H7901|and lie down,]] [[H1931|and he]] [[H5046|will explain]] [[H834|to you what]] [[H6213|you should do.”]] ^0304

[[H6213|“I will do]] [[H3605|everything]] [[H559|you say,”]] [[H559|Ruth answered.]] ^0305

[[H3381|So she went down]] [[H1637|to the threshing floor]] [[H6213|and did]] [[H3605|everything]] [[H2545|her mother-in-law]] [[H6680|had instructed her.]] ^0306

[[H1162|After Boaz]] [[H398|had finished eating]] [[H8354|and drinking]] [[H3190|and was in good spirits,]] [[H935|he went]] [[H7901|to lie down]] [[H7097|at the end]] [[H6194|of the heap of grain.]] [[H935|Then went in secretly,]] ⟨Ruth⟩ [[H1540|uncovered]] [[H4772|his feet,]] [[H7901|and lay down.]] ^0307

[[H2677|At midnight,]] [[H376|Boaz]] [[H2729|was startled,]] [[H3943|turned over,]] [[H2009|and there]] [[H7901|lying]] [[H4772|at his feet]] [[H802|was a woman!]] ^0308

[[H4310|“Who]] [[H859|are you?”]] [[H559|he asked.]] [[H595|“I]] ⟨am⟩ [[H519|your servant]] [[H7327|Ruth,”]] [[H559|she replied.]] [[H6566|“Spread]] [[H3671|the corner of your garment]] [[H5921|over]] [[H519|me,]] [[H3588|for]] [[H859|you]] [[H1350|are a kinsman-redeemer.”]] ^0309

[[H559|Then said,]] ⟨Boaz⟩ [[H3069|“May the LORD]] [[H1288|bless]] [[H859|you,]] [[H1323|my daughter.]] [[H3190|You have shown]] [[H2617|more kindness]] [[H314|now]] [[H4480|than]] [[H7223|before,]] [[H1115|because you have not]] [[H1980|run]] [[H310|after]] [[H970|the younger men,]] [[H518|whether]] [[H6223|rich]] [[H518|or]] [[H1800|poor.]] ^0310

[[H6258|And now]] [[H408|do not]] [[H3372|be afraid,]] [[H1323|my daughter.]] [[H6213|I will do]] [[H3605|for you  whatever]] [[H559|you request,]] [[H3588|since]] [[H3605|all]] [[H5971|my fellow townspeople]] [[H3045|know]] [[H3588|that]] [[H859|you]] [[H802|are a woman]] [[H2428|of noble character.]] ^0311

[[H3588|Yes,]] [[H551|it is true]] [[H3588|that]] [[H595|I]] ⟨am⟩ [[H1350|a kinsman-redeemer,]] [[H1571|but]] [[H3426|there is]] [[H1350|a redeemer]] [[H7138|nearer]] [[H4480|than I.]] ^0312

[[H3885|Stay here tonight,]] [[H1242|and in the morning,]] [[H518|if]] [[H1350|he wants to redeem you,]] [[H2896|good.]] [[H1350|Let him redeem you.]] [[H518|But if]] [[H3808|he does not]] [[H2654|want]] [[H1350|to redeem you,]] [[H3068|as surely as the LORD]] [[H2416|lives,]] [[H595|I]] [[H1350|will.]] [[H7901|Now lie here]] [[H5704|until]] [[H1242|morning.”]] ^0313

[[H7901|So she lay down]] [[H4772|at his feet]] [[H5704|until]] [[H1242|morning,]] [[H6965|but she got up]] [[H2958|before]] [[H376|anyone]] [[H7453|else]] [[H5234|could recognize her.]] [[H559|Then Boaz said,]] [[H408|“Do not]] [[H3045|let it be known]] [[H3588|that]] [[H802|a woman]] [[H935|came]] [[H1637|to the threshing floor.”]] ^0314

[[H559|And he told her,]] [[H3051|“Bring]] [[H4304|the shawl]] [[H5921|you are wearing]] [[H270|and hold it out.”]] [[H270|When she]] ⟨did so⟩, [[H4058|he shoveled]] [[H8337|six measures]] [[H8184|of barley]] [[H5921|into her shawl.]] [[H935|Then he went]] [[H5892|into the city.]] ^0315

[[H935|When Ruth returned]] [[H413|to]] [[H2545|her mother-in-law,]] [[H559|Naomi asked her,]] [[H4310|“How did it go,]] [[H1323|my daughter?”]] [[H5046|Then Ruth told]] [[H3605|her  all]] [[H834|that]] ⟨Boaz⟩ [[H376|]] [[H6213|had done]] ^0316

[[H559|And she said,]] [[H5414|“He gave]] [[H428|me these]] [[H8337|six]] [[H8184|measures of barley,]] [[H3588|for]] [[H559|he said,]] [[H408|‘Do not]] [[H935|go back]] [[H413|to]] [[H2545|your mother-in-law]] [[H7387|empty-handed.’”]] ^0317

[[H3427|“Wait,]] [[H1323|my daughter,”]] [[H559|said Naomi,]] [[H5704|“until]] [[H3045|you find out]] [[H349|how]] [[H1697|things]] [[H5307|go,]] [[H3588|for]] [[H376|he]] [[H3808|will not]] [[H8252|rest]] [[H3588|unless]] [[H3615|he has resolved]] [[H1697|the matter]] [[H3117|today.”]] ^0318

[[H1162|Meanwhile Boaz]] [[H5927|went]] [[H8179|to the gate]] [[H3427|and sat down]] [[H8033|there.]] [[H2009|Soon]] [[H1350|the kinsman-redeemer]] [[H1162|of whom]] ⟨he⟩ [[H1696|had spoken]] [[H5674|came along,]] [[H559|and Boaz said,]] [[H5493|“Come over]] [[H6311|here,]] [[H6423|my friend,]] [[H3427|and sit down.”]] [[H5493|So he went over]] [[H3427|and sat down.]] ^0401

[[H3947|Then Boaz took]] [[H6235|ten]] [[H2205|of the elders]] [[H5892|of the city]] [[H559|and said,]] [[H3427|“Sit]] [[H6311|here,”]] [[H3427|and they did so.]] ^0402

[[H559|And he said]] [[H1350|to the kinsman-redeemer,]] [[H5281|“Naomi,]] [[H7725|who has returned]] [[H7704|from the land]] [[H4124|of Moab,]] [[H4376|is selling]] [[H2513|a piece]] [[H7704|of land]] [[H834|that]] [[H251|belonged to our brother]] [[H458|Elimelech.]] ^0403

[[H589|I]] [[H559|thought]] [[H1540|I should inform]] [[H241|you]] [[H7069|that you may buy it back]] [[H5048|in the presence of]] [[H3427|those seated here]] [[H5048|and in the presence of]] [[H2205|the elders]] [[H5971|of my people.]] [[H518|If]] [[H1350|you want to redeem it,]] [[H1350|do so.]] [[H518|But if you]] [[H3808|will not]] [[H1350|redeem]] ⟨it⟩, [[H5046|tell]] [[H3045|me  so I may know,]] [[H3588|because]] ⟨there is⟩ [[H369|no one]] [[H2108|but you]] [[H1350|to redeem]] ⟨it⟩, [[H595|and I]] ⟨am⟩ [[H310|next after you.]] [[H595|I]] [[H1350|will redeem]] ⟨it⟩, [[H559|he replied.]] ^0404

[[H1162|Then Boaz]] [[H559|said,]] [[H3117|“On the day]] [[H7069|you buy]] [[H7704|the land]] [[H3027|from]] [[H5281|Naomi]] [[H854|and also from]] [[H7327|Ruth]] [[H4125|the Moabitess,]] [[H7069|you must also acquire]] [[H802|the widow]] [[H4191|of the deceased]] [[H6965|in order to raise]] [[H8034|up the name]] [[H4191|of the deceased]] [[H5921|on]] [[H5159|his inheritance.”]] ^0405

[[H1350|The kinsman-redeemer]] [[H559|replied,]] [[H3808|“I cannot]] [[H1350|redeem it myself,]] [[H6435|or]] [[H7843|I would jeopardize]] [[H5159|my own inheritance.]] [[H1353|Take my right of redemption,]] [[H3588|because]] [[H3808|I cannot]] [[H1350|redeem it.”]] ^0406

[[H2063|(Now]] [[H6440|in former times]] [[H3478|in Israel,]] [[H5921|concerning]] [[H1353|the redemption]] [[H8545|or exchange of property,]] [[H3605|to make any]] [[H1697|matter]] [[H6965|legally binding]] [[H376|a man]] [[H8025|would remove]] [[H5275|his sandal]] [[H5414|and give it]] [[H7453|to the other party,]] [[H2063|and this]] ⟨was⟩ [[H8584|a confirmation]] [[H3478|in Israel.)]] ^0407

[[H1350|So the kinsman-redeemer]] [[H8025|removed]] [[H5275|his sandal]] [[H559|and said]] [[H1162|to Boaz,]] [[H7069|“Buy]] ⟨it⟩ ^0408

[[H1162|At this, Boaz]] [[H559|said]] [[H2205|to the elders]] [[H3605|and all]] [[H5971|the people,]] [[H859|“You]] [[H5707|are witnesses]] [[H3117|today]] [[H3588|that]] [[H7069|I am buying]] [[H3027|from]] [[H5281|Naomi]] [[H3605|all]] [[H834|that]] [[H458|belonged to Elimelech,]] [[H3630|Chilion,]] [[H4248|and Mahlon.]] ^0409

[[H1571|Moreover,]] [[H7069|I have acquired]] [[H7327|Ruth]] [[H4125|the Moabitess,]] [[H4248|Mahlon’s]] [[H802|widow,]] [[H802|as my wife,]] [[H6965|to raise up]] [[H8034|the name]] [[H4191|of the deceased]] [[H5921|through]] [[H5159|his inheritance,]] [[H4191|so that his]] [[H8034|name]] [[H3808|will not]] [[H3772|disappear]] [[H5973|from among]] [[H251|his brothers]] [[H8179|or from the gate]] [[H4725|of his home.]] [[H859|You]] [[H5707|are witnesses today.]] ^0410

[[H5707|“We are witnesses,”]] [[H559|said]] [[H2205|the elders]] [[H3605|and all]] [[H5971|the people]] [[H8179|at the gate.]] [[H3068|“May the LORD]] [[H5414|make]] [[H802|the woman]] [[H935|entering]] [[H1004|your home]] [[H7354|like Rachel]] [[H3812|and Leah,]] [[H834|who]] [[H1129|together built up]] [[H1004|the house]] [[H3478|of Israel.]] [[H6213|May you be]] [[H2428|prosperous]] [[H672|in Ephrathah]] [[H7121|and famous]] [[H1035|in  Bethlehem.]] ^0411

[[H1004|And may your house]] [[H1961|become]] [[H1004|like the house]] [[H6557|of Perez,]] [[H834|whom]] [[H8559|Tamar]] [[H3205|bore]] [[H3063|to Judah,]] [[H4480|because of]] [[H2233|the offspring]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H5414|will give]] [[H4480|you  by]] [[H2063|this]] [[H5291|young woman.”]] ^0412

[[H1162|So Boaz]] [[H3947|took]] [[H7327|Ruth]] [[H1961|and she became]] [[H802|his wife.]] [[H935|And he had relations with]] [[H413|her,]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H5414|enabled]] [[H2032|her  to conceive,]] [[H3205|and she gave birth to]] [[H1121|a son.]] ^0413

[[H802|Then the women]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H5281|Naomi,]] [[H1288|“Blessed]] ⟨be⟩ [[H3068|the LORD,]] [[H834|who]] [[H3808|has not]] [[H7673|left]] [[H3117|you  this day]] [[H1350|without a kinsman-redeemer.]] [[H8034|May his name]] [[H7121|become famous]] [[H3478|in Israel.]] ^0414

[[H1961|He will renew]] [[H5315|your life]] [[H3557|and sustain you]] [[H7872|in your old age.]] [[H3588|For]] [[H3618|your daughter-in-law,]] [[H834|who]] [[H157|loves]] [[H2896|you and is better]] [[H7651|to you than  seven]] [[H1121|sons,]] [[H3205|has given him birth.”]] ^0415

[[H5281|And Naomi]] [[H3947|took]] [[H3206|the child,]] [[H7896|placed]] [[H2436|him on her lap,]] [[H1961|and became]] [[H539|a nurse]] ^0416

[[H7934|The neighbor]] [[H559|women said,]] [[H1121|“A son]] [[H3205|has been born]] [[H5281|to Naomi,”]] [[H7121|and they named]] [[H5744|him  Obed.]] [[H1931|He]] ⟨became⟩ [[H1|the father]] [[H3448|of Jesse,]] [[H1|the father]] [[H1732|of David.]] ^0417

[[H428|Now these]] ⟨are⟩ [[H8435|the generations]] [[H6557|of Perez:]] [[H6557|Perez]] [[H3205|was the father of]] [[H2696|Hezron,]] ^0418

[[H2696|Hezron]] [[H3205|was the father of]] [[H7410|Ram,]] [[H7410|Ram]] [[H3205|was the father of]] [[H5992|Amminadab,]] ^0419

[[H5992|Amminadab]] [[H3205|was the father of]] [[H5177|Nahshon,]] [[H5177|Nahshon]] [[H3205|was the father of]] [[H8009|Salmon,]] ^0420

[[H8012|Salmon]] [[H3205|was the father of]] [[H1162|Boaz,]] [[H1162|Boaz]] [[H3205|was the father of]] [[H5744|Obed,]] ^0421

[[H5744|Obed]] [[H3205|was the father of]] [[H3448|Jesse,]] [[H3448|and Jesse]] [[H3205|was the father of]] [[H1732|David.]] ^0422
