[[H6343|fear]] [[H7460|and trembling]] [[H7122|came over me]] [[H7230|and made all]] [[H6106|my bones]] [[H6342|shake.]] ^0414

[[H7307|Then a spirit]] [[H2498|glided]] [[H5921|past]] [[H6440|my face,]] ⟨and⟩ [[H8185|the hair]] [[H1320|on my body]] [[H5568|bristled.]] ^0415

[[H5975|It stood still,]] [[H3808|but I could not]] [[H5234|discern]] [[H4758|its appearance;]] [[H8544|a form]] [[H5048|loomed before]] [[H5869|my eyes,]] [[H8085|and I heard]] [[H1827|a whispering]] [[H6963|voice:]] ^0416

[[H376|‘Can a]] ⟨mortal⟩ [[H6663|be more righteous]] [[H433|than God,]] [[H518|or]] [[H1397|a man]] [[H2891|more pure]] [[H6213|than his Maker?]] ^0417

[[H6565|He thwarts]] [[H4284|the schemes]] [[H6175|of the crafty,]] [[H3027|so that their hands]] [[H6213|find]] [[H3808|no]] [[H8454|success.]] ^0512

[[H3920|He catches]] [[H2450|the wise]] [[H6193|in their craftiness,]] [[H4116|and sweeps away]] [[H6098|the plans]] [[H6617|of the cunning.]] ^0513

[[H834|His]] [[H3689|confidence]] [[H6990|is fragile;]] [[H4009|his security]] [[H5908|is in a spider’s]] [[H1004|web.]] ^0814

[[H8172|He leans]] [[H5921|on]] [[H1004|his web,]] [[H5975|but it gives way;]] [[H2388|he holds fast,]] [[H3808|but it does not]] [[H6965|endure.]] ^0815

[[H1931|He]] [[H7373|is a well-watered plant]] [[H6440|in]] [[H8121|the sunshine,]] [[H3318|spreading]] [[H3127|its shoots]] [[H5921|over]] [[H1593|the garden.]] ^0816

[[H8328|His roots]] [[H5440|wrap]] [[H5921|around]] [[H1530|the rock heap;]] [[H2372|he looks for]] [[H1004|a home among]] [[H68|the stones.]] ^0817

[[H518|If]] [[H1104|he is uprooted]] [[H4725|from his place,]] [[H3584|it will disown]] [[H3808|him,  saying, ‘I never]] [[H7200|saw you.’]] ^0818

[[H2005|Surely]] [[H1931|this]] [[H4885|is the joy]] [[H1870|of His way;]] [[H312|yet others]] [[H6779|will spring]] [[H6083|from the dust.]] ^0819

[[H2005|Behold,]] [[H410|God]] [[H3808|does not]] [[H3988|reject]] [[H8535|the blameless,]] [[H3808|nor will He]] [[H2388|strengthen]] [[H3027|the hand]] [[H7489|of evildoers.]] ^0820

[[H5704|He will yet]] [[H6310|fill your mouth]] [[H4390|with]] [[H7814|laughter,]] [[H8193|and your lips]] [[H8643|with a shout of joy.]] ^0821

[[H8130|Your enemies]] [[H3847|will be clothed]] [[H1322|in shame,]] [[H168|and the tent]] [[H7563|of the wicked]] [[H369|will be no more.”]] ^0822

[[H347|Then Job]] [[H6030|answered:]] ^0901

[[H551|“Yes,]] [[H3045|I know]] [[H3588|that]] ⟨it is⟩ [[H3651|so,]] [[H4100|but how]] [[H582|can a mortal]] [[H6663|be righteous]] [[H5973|before]] [[H410|God?]] ^0902

[[H518|If]] [[H2654|one wished]] [[H7378|to contend]] [[H5973|with]] ⟨God⟩, [[H3808|he could not]] [[H6030|answer Him]] [[H259|one]] ⟨time⟩ [[H4480|out]] [[H505|of a thousand.]] ^0903

⟨God is⟩ [[H2450|wise]] [[H3824|in heart]] [[H533|and mighty]] [[H3581|in strength.]] [[H4310|Who]] [[H7185|has hardened]] ⟨himself⟩ [[H413|against Him]] [[H7999|and prospered?]] ^0904

[[H6275|He moves]] [[H2022|mountains]] [[H3808|without]] [[H3045|their knowledge,]] [[H834|when]] [[H2015|He overturns them]] [[H639|in His anger.]] ^0905

[[H7264|He shakes]] [[H776|the earth]] [[H4725|from its place,]] [[H5982|so that its foundations]] [[H6426|tremble.]] ^0906

[[H559|He commands]] [[H2775|the sun]] [[H3808|not]] [[H2224|to shine,]] [[H1157|and seals off]] [[H3556|the stars.]] ^0907

[[H905|He alone]] [[H5186|stretches out]] [[H8064|the heavens,]] [[H1869|and treads]] [[H5921|on]] [[H1116|the waves]] [[H3220|of the sea.]] ^0908

[[H6213|He is the Maker]] [[H5906|of the Bear]] ⟨and⟩ [[H3685|Orion,]] [[H3598|of the Pleiades]] [[H2315|and the constellations]] [[H8486|of the south.]] ^0909

[[H6213|He does]] [[H1419|great]] [[H369|and unfathomable]] ⟨things⟩, [[H6381|wonders]] [[H369|without]] [[H4557|number.]] ^0910

[[H2005|Were He]] [[H5674|to pass]] [[H5921|by me,]] [[H3808|I would not]] [[H7200|see Him;]] [[H2498|were He to move,]] [[H3808|I would not]] [[H995|recognize Him.]] ^0911

[[H2005|If]] [[H2862|He snatches away,]] [[H4310|who]] [[H7725|can hinder Him?]] [[H4310|Who]] [[H559|can say]] [[H413|to Him,]] [[H4100|‘What]] [[H6213|are You doing?’]] ^0912

[[H433|God]] [[H3808|does not]] [[H7725|restrain]] [[H639|His anger;]] [[H5826|the helpers]] [[H7293|of Rahab]] [[H7817|cower]] [[H8478|beneath Him.]] ^0913

[[H637|How]] [[H3588|then]] [[H595|can I]] [[H6030|answer Him]] [[H977|or choose]] [[H1697|my arguments]] [[H5973|against Him?]] ^0914

[[H834|For]] [[H518|even if]] [[H6663|I were right,]] [[H3808|I could not]] [[H6030|answer.]] [[H8199|I could only beg my Judge]] [[H2603|for mercy.]] ^0915

[[H518|If]] [[H7121|I summoned Him]] [[H6030|and He answered me,]] [[H3808|I do not]] [[H539|believe]] [[H238|He would listen]] [[H6963|to my voice.]] ^0916

[[H834|For]] [[H7779|He would crush me]] [[H8183|with a tempest]] [[H7235|and multiply]] [[H6482|my wounds]] [[H2600|without cause.]] ^0917

[[H3808|He does not]] [[H5414|let]] [[H7725|me catch]] [[H7307|my breath,]] [[H3588|but]] [[H7646|overwhelms me]] [[H4472|with bitterness.]] ^0918

[[H518|If]] [[H3581|it is a matter of strength,]] [[H2009|He is indeed]] [[H533|mighty!]] [[H518|If]] [[H4941|it is a matter of justice,]] [[H4310|who]] [[H3259|can summon Him?]] ^0919

[[H518|Even if]] [[H6663|I were righteous,]] [[H6310|my mouth]] [[H7561|would condemn me;]] [[H589|if I]] [[H8535|were blameless,]] [[H6140|it would declare me guilty.]] ^0920

[[H589|Though I]] [[H8535|am blameless,]] [[H3808|I have no]] [[H3045|concern]] [[H5315|for myself;]] [[H3988|I despise]] [[H2416|my life.]] ^0921

[[H1931|It]] [[H259|is all the same;]] [[H5921|that is why]] [[H559|I say,]] [[H1931|‘He]] [[H3615|destroys]] [[H8535|both the blameless]] [[H7563|and the wicked.’]] ^0922

[[H518|When]] [[H7752|the scourge]] [[H6597|brings sudden]] [[H4191|death,]] [[H3932|He mocks]] [[H4531|the despair]] [[H5355|of the innocent.]] ^0923

[[H776|The earth]] [[H5414|is given]] [[H3027|into the hand]] [[H7563|of the wicked;]] [[H6440|He blindfolds]] [[H8199|its judges.]] [[H518|If]] [[H3808|it is not]] ⟨He⟩, [[H645|then]] [[H4310|who]] ⟨is⟩ [[H1931|it?]] ^0924

[[H3117|My days]] [[H7043|are swifter]] [[H4480|than]] [[H7323|a runner;]] [[H1272|they flee]] [[H3808|without]] [[H7200|seeing]] [[H2896|any good.]] ^0925

[[H2498|They sweep by]] [[H5973|like]] [[H591|boats]] [[H16|of papyrus,]] [[H5404|like an eagle]] [[H2907|swooping down]] [[H5921|on]] [[H400|its prey.]] ^0926

[[H518|If]] [[H559|I say,]] [[H7911|‘I will forget]] [[H7879|my complaint,]] [[H5800|I will change]] [[H6440|my expression,]] [[H1082|and smile,’]] ^0927

[[H3025|I would still dread]] [[H3605|all]] [[H6094|my sufferings;]] [[H3045|I know]] [[H3588|that]] [[H3808|You will not]] [[H5352|acquit me.]] ^0928

[[H595|Since I am]] [[H7561|already found guilty,]] [[H4100|why]] [[H3021|should I labor]] [[H1892|in vain?]] ^0929

[[H518|If]] [[H7364|I should wash myself]] [[H4325|with snow]] [[H2141|and cleanse]] [[H3709|my hands]] [[H1253|with lye,]] ^0930

[[H227|then]] [[H2881|You would plunge me]] [[H7845|into the pit,]] [[H8008|and even my own clothes]] [[H8581|would despise me!]] ^0931

[[H3588|For]] [[H3808|He is not]] [[H376|a man]] [[H3644|like me,]] [[H6030|that I can answer Him,]] [[H935|that we can take]] [[H3162|each other]] [[H4941|to court.]] ^0932

[[H3863|Nor]] [[H3426|is there]] [[H3198|a mediator]] [[H996|between us,]] [[H7896|to lay]] [[H3027|his hand]] [[H5921|upon]] [[H8147|us both.]] ^0933

[[H5493|Let Him remove]] [[H7626|His rod]] [[H5921|from me,]] [[H367|so that His terror]] [[H408|will no]] [[H1204|longer frighten me.]] ^0934

[[H1696|Then I would speak]] [[H3808|without]] [[H3372|fear of Him.]] [[H3588|But]] [[H3808|as it is,]] [[H595|I]] [[H5978|am on my own.]] ^0935

[[H5354|I loathe]] [[H5315|my own]] [[H2416|life;]] [[H5800|I will express]] [[H7879|my complaint]] [[H1696|and speak]] [[H4751|in the bitterness]] [[H5315|of my soul.]] ^1001

[[H559|I will say]] [[H413|to]] [[H433|God:]] [[H408|‘Do not]] [[H7561|condemn me!]] [[H3045|Let me know]] [[H5921|why]] [[H7378|You prosecute me.’]] ^1002

[[H2896|Does it please]] [[H6231|You  to oppress me,]] [[H3988|to reject]] [[H3018|the work]] [[H3709|of Your hands,]] [[H3313|and favor]] [[H6098|the schemes]] [[H7563|of the wicked?]] ^1003

[[H5869|Do You have eyes]] [[H1320|of flesh?]] [[H7200|Do You see]] [[H582|as man]] [[H7200|sees?]] ^1004

[[H3117|Are Your days]] [[H3117|like those]] [[H582|of a]] ⟨mortal⟩, [[H518|or]] [[H8141|Your years]] [[H3117|like those]] [[H1397|of a man,]] ^1005

[[H3588|that]] [[H1245|You should seek]] [[H5771|my iniquity]] [[H1875|and search out]] [[H2403|my sin—]] ^1006

[[H5921|though]] [[H1847|You know]] [[H3588|that]] [[H3808|I am not]] [[H7561|guilty,]] [[H369|and there is no]] [[H5337|deliverance]] [[H3027|from Your hand?]] ^1007

[[H3027|Your hands]] [[H6087|shaped me]] [[H3162|and altogether]] [[H6213|formed me.]] [[H5439|Will You now turn]] [[H1104|and destroy me?]] ^1008

[[H4994|Please]] [[H2142|remember]] [[H3588|that]] [[H6213|You molded]] [[H2563|me like clay.]] [[H7725|Will You now return]] [[H413|me to]] [[H6083|dust?]] ^1009

[[H3808|Did You not]] [[H5413|pour me out]] [[H2461|like milk,]] [[H7087|and curdle]] [[H1385|me like cheese?]] ^1010

[[H3847|You clothed]] [[H5785|me with skin]] [[H1320|and flesh,]] [[H5526|and knit me together]] [[H6106|with bones]] [[H1517|and sinews.]] ^1011

[[H6213|You have granted]] [[H5978|me]] [[H2416|life]] [[H2617|and loving devotion,]] [[H6486|and Your care]] [[H8104|has preserved]] [[H7307|my spirit.]] ^1012

[[H6845|Yet You concealed]] [[H428|these]] ⟨things⟩ [[H3824|in Your heart,]] [[H3045|and I know]] [[H3588|that]] [[H2063|this]] ⟨was⟩ [[H5973|in Your]] ⟨mind⟩: ^1013

[[H518|If]] [[H2398|I sinned,]] [[H8104|You would take note,]] [[H3808|and would not]] [[H5352|acquit me]] [[H5771|of my iniquity.]] ^1014

[[H518|If]] [[H7561|I am guilty,]] [[H480|woe]] [[H6663|to me!  And even if I am righteous,]] [[H3808|I cannot]] [[H5375|lift]] [[H7218|my head.]] ⟨I am⟩ [[H7646|full]] [[H7036|of shame]] [[H7200|and aware of]] [[H6040|my affliction.]] ^1015

[[H1342|Should I hold my head high,]] [[H6679|You would hunt me]] [[H7826|like a lion,]] [[H7725|and again]] [[H6381|display Your power]] ^1016

[[H2318|You produce new]] [[H5707|witnesses]] [[H5048|against me]] [[H7235|and multiply]] [[H3708|Your anger]] [[H5978|toward me.]] [[H6635|Hardships]] [[H5973|assault me]] [[H2487|in wave after wave.]] ^1017

[[H4100|Why then]] [[H3318|did You bring me]] [[H7358|from the womb?]] [[H1478|Oh, that I had died,]] [[H3808|and no]] [[H5869|eye]] [[H7200|had seen me!]] ^1018

[[H834|If only]] [[H3808|I had never]] [[H1961|come]] [[H1961|to be,]] [[H2986|but had been carried]] [[H990|from the womb]] [[H6913|to the grave.]] ^1019

[[H3117|Are my days]] [[H3808|not]] [[H4592|few?]] [[H2308|Withdraw]] [[H4480|from me,]] [[H1082|that I may have a little comfort,]] ^1020

[[H2962|before]] [[H1980|I go—]] [[H3808|never]] [[H7725|to return—]] [[H413|to]] [[H776|a land]] [[H2822|of darkness]] [[H6757|and gloom,]] ^1021

[[H776|to a land]] [[H5890|of utter darkness,]] [[H6757|of deep shadow]] [[H3808|and disorder,]] [[H3313|where even the light]] [[H3644|is like]] [[H652|darkness.”]] ^1022

[[H6691|Then Zophar]] [[H5284|the Naamathite]] [[H6030|replied:]] ^1101

[[H7230|“Should this stream]] [[H1697|of words]] [[H3808|go unanswered]] [[H518|and such]] [[H376|a speaker]] [[H6663|be vindicated?]] ^1102

[[H559|You have said,]] [[H3948|‘My doctrine]] ⟨is⟩ [[H2134|sound,]] [[H1961|and I am]] [[H1249|pure]] [[H5869|in Your sight.’]] ^1104

[[H199|But]] [[H4310|if only]] [[H433|God]] [[H1696|would speak]] [[H6605|and open]] [[H8193|His lips]] [[H5973|against you,]] ^1105

[[H5046|and disclose]] [[H8587|to you  the secrets]] [[H2451|of wisdom,]] [[H3588|for]] [[H8454|true wisdom]] [[H3718|has two sides.]] [[H3045|Know]] [[H3588|then that]] [[H433|God]] [[H5382|exacts]] [[H5771|from you than your iniquity]] ⟨less⟩ ⟨deserves⟩. ^1106

[[H4672|Can you fathom]] [[H2714|the deep things]] [[H433|of God]] [[H518|or]] [[H4672|discover]] [[H8503|the limits]] [[H7706|of the Almighty?]] ^1107

[[H1363|They are higher]] [[H8064|than the heavens—]] [[H4100|what]] [[H6466|can you do?]] [[H6013|They are deeper]] [[H7585|than Sheol—]] [[H4100|what]] [[H3045|can you know?]] ^1108

[[H4055|Their measure]] [[H752|is longer]] [[H4480|than]] [[H776|the earth]] [[H7342|and wider]] [[H3220|than the sea.]] ^1109

[[H518|If]] [[H2498|He comes along]] [[H5462|to imprison you,]] [[H6950|or convenes a court,]] [[H4310|who]] [[H7725|can hinder Him?]] ^1110

[[H3588|Surely]] [[H1931|He]] [[H3045|knows]] [[H7723|the deceit]] [[H4962|of men.]] [[H7200|If He sees]] [[H205|iniquity,]] [[H3808|does He not]] [[H995|take note?]] ^1111

[[H5014|But a witless]] [[H376|man]] [[H3823|can no more become wise]] [[H5895|than the colt]] [[H6501|of a wild donkey]] [[H3205|can be born]] [[H120|a man!]] ^1112

[[H859|As for you,]] [[H518|if]] [[H3559|you direct]] [[H3820|your heart]] [[H6566|and lift up]] [[H3709|your hands]] [[H413|to Him,]] ^1113

[[H518|if]] [[H7368|you put away]] [[H205|the iniquity]] [[H3027|in your hand,]] [[H408|and allow no]] [[H5766|injustice]] [[H7931|to dwell]] [[H168|in your tents,]] ^1114

[[H227|then]] [[H3588|indeed]] [[H5375|you will lift up]] [[H6440|your face]] [[H3971|without shame;]] [[H1961|you will]] [[H3332|stand firm]] [[H3808|and unafraid.]] ^1115

[[H3588|For]] [[H859|you]] [[H7911|will forget]] ⟨your⟩ [[H5999|misery,]] [[H2142|recalling]] [[H4325|it only as waters]] [[H5674|gone by.]] ^1116

[[H2465|Your life]] [[H6965|will be brighter]] [[H6672|than noonday;]] [[H5774|its darkness]] [[H1961|will be]] [[H1242|like the morning.]] ^1117

[[H982|You will be secure,]] [[H3588|because]] [[H3426|there is]] [[H8615|hope,]] [[H2658|and you will look around]] [[H7901|and lie down]] [[H983|in safety.]] ^1118

[[H518|Even if]] [[H1696|I speak,]] [[H3511|my pain]] [[H3808|is not]] [[H2820|relieved,]] [[H2308|and if I hold back,]] [[H4100|how]] [[H1980|will it go away?]] ^1606

[[H389|Surely]] [[H6258|He has now]] [[H3811|exhausted me;]] [[H8074|You have devastated]] [[H3605|all]] [[H5712|my family.]] ^1607

[[H7059|You have shriveled me up]] ⟨as⟩ [[H1961|]] [[H5707|a witness]] ⟨against me⟩; [[H3585|my frailty]] [[H6965|rises up]] [[H6030|and testifies]] [[H6440|against me.]] ^1608

[[H639|His anger]] [[H2963|has torn me]] [[H7852|and hated me;]] [[H2786|He gnashes]] [[H8127|His teeth]] [[H5921|at me.]] [[H6862|My adversary]] [[H3913|pierces]] [[H5869|me  with His eyes.]] ^1609

[[H6473|They open]] [[H6310|their mouths]] [[H5921|against me]] [[H5221|and strike]] [[H3895|my cheeks]] [[H2781|with contempt;]] [[H4390|they join]] [[H3162|together]] [[H5921|against me.]] ^1610

[[H410|God]] [[H5462|has delivered me]] [[H413|to]] [[H5760|unjust men;]] [[H3399|He has thrown me]] [[H5921|to]] [[H3027|the clutches]] [[H7563|of the wicked.]] ^1611

[[H1961|I was]] [[H7961|at ease,]] [[H6565|but He shattered me;]] [[H270|He seized me]] [[H6203|by the neck]] [[H6327|and crushed me.]] [[H6965|He has set me up]] [[H4307|as His  target;]] ^1612

[[H6555|He breaks me]] [[H6556|with wound]] [[H6556|upon wound;]] [[H7323|He rushes]] [[H5921|me]] [[H1368|like a warrior.]] ^1614

[[H8609|I have sewn]] [[H8242|sackcloth]] [[H5921|over]] [[H1539|my skin;]] [[H5953|I have buried]] [[H7161|my horn]] [[H6083|in the dust.]] ^1615

[[H776|O earth,]] [[H408|do not]] [[H3680|cover]] [[H1818|my blood;]] [[H2201|may my cry for help]] [[H408|never]] [[H1961|be]] [[H4725|laid to rest.]] ^1618

[[H3588|For when]] [[H4557|only a few]] [[H8141|years]] [[H857|are past]] [[H1980|I will go]] [[H734|the way]] [[H3808|of no]] [[H7725|return.]] ^1622

[[H7760|Give]] ⟨me⟩, [[H4994|I pray,]] [[H6148|the pledge]] [[H5973|You]] ⟨demand⟩. [[H4310|Who else]] [[H3027|will be my guarantor?]] ^1703

[[H5046|If a man denounces]] [[H7453|his friends]] [[H2506|for a price,]] [[H5869|the eyes]] [[H1121|of his children]] [[H3615|will fail.]] ^1705

[[H3322|He has made me]] [[H4914|a byword]] [[H5971|to the people;]] [[H1961|I am the one]] [[H6440|in whose face]] [[H8611|they spit.]] ^1706

[[H3477|The upright]] [[H8074|are appalled]] [[H5921|at]] [[H2063|this,]] [[H5355|and the innocent]] [[H5782|are stirred]] [[H5921|against]] [[H2611|the godless.]] ^1708

[[H6662|Yet the righteous]] [[H270|will hold]] [[H1870|to his way,]] [[H3027|and the one with clean hands]] [[H3254|will grow]] [[H555|stronger.]] ^1709

[[H4069|Why]] [[H2803|are we regarded]] [[H929|as cattle,]] [[H2933|as stupid]] [[H5869|in your sight?]] ^1803

[[H2963|You who tear]] [[H5315|yourself]] [[H639|in anger—]] [[H776|should the earth]] [[H5800|be forsaken]] [[H4616|on your account,]] [[H6697|or the rocks]] [[H6275|be moved]] [[H4725|from their place?]] ^1804

[[H1571|Indeed,]] [[H216|the lamp]] [[H7563|of the wicked]] [[H1846|is extinguished;]] [[H7632|the flame]] [[H784|of his fire]] [[H3808|does not]] [[H5050|glow.]] ^1805

[[H202|His vigorous]] [[H6806|stride]] [[H3334|is shortened,]] [[H6098|and his own schemes]] [[H7993|trip him up.]] ^1807

[[H3588|For]] [[H7272|his own feet]] [[H7971|lead]] [[H7568|him into a net,]] [[H1980|and he wanders]] [[H5921|into]] [[H7639|its mesh.]] ^1808

[[H6341|A trap]] [[H270|seizes]] [[H6119|his heel;]] [[H6782|a snare]] [[H2388|grips him.]] ^1809

[[H2256|A noose]] [[H2934|is hidden]] [[H776|in the ground,]] [[H4434|and a trap]] [[H5921|lies in]] [[H5410|his path.]] ^1810

[[H5423|He is torn]] [[H4009|from the shelter]] [[H168|of his tent]] [[H6805|and is marched off]] [[H4428|to the king]] [[H1091|of terrors.]] ^1814

[[H1097|Fire]] [[H7931|resides]] [[H168|in his tent;]] [[H1614|brimstone]] [[H2219|is scattered]] [[H5921|over]] [[H5116|his home.]] ^1815

[[H2143|The memory of him]] [[H6|perishes]] [[H4480|from]] [[H776|the earth,]] [[H3808|and he has  no]] [[H8034|name]] [[H6440|in]] [[H2351|the land.]] ^1817

[[H1920|He is driven]] [[H216|from light]] [[H413|into]] [[H2822|darkness]] [[H5074|and is chased]] [[H8398|from the inhabited world.]] ^1818

[[H3808|He has no]] [[H5209|offspring]] [[H5220|or posterity]] [[H5971|among his people,]] [[H369|no]] [[H8300|survivor]] [[H4033|where he once lived.]] ^1819

[[H645|then]] [[H3045|understand]] [[H3588|that]] [[H433|it is God]] [[H5791|who has wronged me]] [[H4686|and drawn His net]] [[H5362|around]] [[H5921|me.]] ^1906

[[H6584|He has stripped]] [[H3519|me of my honor]] [[H5493|and removed]] [[H5850|the crown]] [[H7218|from my head.]] ^1909

[[H5422|He tears me down]] [[H5439|on every side]] [[H1980|until I am gone;]] [[H5265|He uproots]] [[H8615|my hope]] [[H6086|like a tree.]] ^1910

[[H2822|In the dark]] [[H2864|they dig through]] [[H1004|houses;]] [[H3119|by day]] [[H2856|they shut themselves in,]] [[H3808|never]] [[H3045|to experience]] [[H216|the light.]] ^2416

[[H3588|For]] [[H6757|to them,  deep darkness]] [[H3162|is their]] [[H1242|morning;]] [[H3588|surely]] [[H5234|they are friends with]] [[H1091|the terrors]] [[H6757|of darkness!]] ^2417

[[H5414|He gives]] [[H983|them  a sense of security,]] [[H5869|but His eyes]] [[H5921|are on]] [[H1870|their ways.]] ^2423

[[H7426|They are exalted]] [[H4592|for a moment,]] [[H369|then they are gone;]] [[H4355|they are brought low]] [[H7092|and gathered up]] [[H3605|like all others;]] [[H5243|they are cut off]] [[H7218|like heads]] [[H7641|of grain.]] ^2424

[[H3519|My glory]] [[H2319|is new]] ⟨ever⟩ [[H5978|within me,]] [[H7198|and my bow]] [[H2498|is renewed]] [[H3027|in my hand.]] ^2920

[[H8085|Men listened]] [[H3176|to me  with expectation,]] [[H1826|waiting silently]] [[H3926|for]] [[H6098|my counsel.]] ^2921

[[H310|After]] [[H1697|my words,]] [[H8138|they spoke]] [[H3808|no more;]] [[H4405|my speech]] [[H5197|settled]] [[H5921|on them like dew.]] ^2922

[[H3176|They waited]] [[H4306|for me as for rain]] [[H6473|and drank in my words]] [[H4456|like spring showers.]] ^2923

[[H7832|If I smiled]] [[H413|at them,]] [[H3808|they did not]] [[H539|believe it;]] [[H216|the light]] [[H6440|of my countenance]] [[H5307|was precious.]] ^2924

[[H977|I chose]] [[H1870|their course]] [[H3427|and presided]] [[H7218|as chief.]] [[H7931|So I dwelt]] [[H4428|as a king]] [[H1416|among his troops,]] [[H834|as a comforter]] [[H57|of mourners.]] ^2925

[[H6258|But now]] [[H7832|they mock me,]] [[H6810|men younger]] [[H4480|than I am,]] [[H834|whose]] [[H1|fathers]] [[H3988|I would have refused]] [[H7896|to put]] [[H5973|with]] [[H6629|my sheep]] [[H3611|dogs.]] ^3001

[[H1571|Indeed,]] [[H4100|what use]] [[H3581|to me  was the strength]] [[H3027|of their hands,]] [[H3624|since their vigor]] [[H6|had left them?]] ^3002

[[H1565|Gaunt]] [[H2639|from poverty]] [[H3720|and hunger,]] [[H6207|they gnawed]] [[H6723|the dry land,]] [[H7722|and the desolate]] [[H4875|wasteland]] [[H570|by night.]] ^3003

[[H6998|They plucked]] [[H4408|mallow]] [[H5921|among]] [[H7880|the shrubs,]] [[H8328|and the roots]] [[H7574|of the broom tree]] [[H3899|were their food.]] ^3004

[[H1644|They were banished]] [[H4480|from]] [[H1460|among]] ⟨men⟩, [[H7321|shouted]] [[H5921|down]] [[H1590|like thieves,]] ^3005

[[H7931|so that they lived]] [[H6178|on the slopes]] [[H5158|of the wadis,]] [[H3710|among the rocks]] [[H2356|and in holes]] [[H6083|in the ground.]] ^3006

[[H5101|They cried out]] [[H996|among]] [[H7880|the shrubs]] [[H5596|and huddled]] [[H8478|beneath]] [[H2738|the nettles.]] ^3007

[[H5036|A senseless]] [[H1571|and]] [[H8034|nameless]] [[H1121|brood,]] [[H5217|they were driven]] [[H4480|off]] [[H776|the land.]] ^3008

[[H6258|And now]] [[H5058|they mock me in song;]] [[H1961|I have become]] [[H4405|a byword]] [[H1992|among them.]] ^3009

[[H8581|They abhor me]] [[H7368|and keep far]] [[H4480|from me;]] [[H3808|they do not]] [[H2820|hesitate]] [[H7536|to spit]] [[H6440|in my face.]] ^3010

[[H3588|Because]] [[H6605|God has unstrung]] [[H3499|my bow]] [[H6031|and afflicted me,]] [[H7971|they have cast off]] [[H7448|restraint]] [[H6440|in my presence.]] ^3011

[[H6526|The rabble]] [[H6965|arises]] [[H5921|at]] [[H3225|my right;]] [[H7971|they lay snares]] [[H7272|for my feet]] [[H5549|and build]] [[H734|siege ramps]] [[H5921|against me.]] ^3012

[[H5420|They tear up]] [[H5410|my path;]] [[H3276|they profit]] [[H1942|from my destruction,]] [[H3808|with no one]] [[H5826|to restrain them.]] ^3013

[[H857|They advance]] [[H7342|as through a gaping]] [[H6556|breach;]] [[H8478|through]] [[H7722|the ruins]] [[H1556|they keep rolling in.]] ^3014

[[H1091|Terrors]] [[H2015|are turned loose]] [[H5921|against me;]] [[H7291|they drive away]] [[H5082|my dignity]] [[H7307|as by the wind,]] [[H3444|and my prosperity]] [[H5674|has passed]] [[H5645|like a cloud.]] ^3015

[[H6258|And now]] [[H5315|my soul]] [[H8210|is poured out]] [[H5921|within me;]] [[H3117|days]] [[H6040|of suffering]] [[H270|grip me.]] ^3016

[[H3915|Night]] [[H5365|pierces]] [[H6106|my bones,]] [[H6207|and my gnawing pains]] [[H3808|never]] [[H7901|rest.]] ^3017

[[H7227|By great]] [[H3581|power]] [[H2664|He becomes like]] [[H3830|my garment;]] [[H247|He seizes me]] [[H6310|by the collar]] [[H3801|of my tunic.]] ^3018

[[H3384|He throws]] [[H2563|me into the mud,]] [[H4911|and I have become]] [[H6083|like dust]] [[H665|and ashes.]] ^3019

[[H413|I cry out to You]] [[H7768|for help,]] [[H3808|but You do not]] [[H6030|answer;]] [[H5975|when I stand up,]] [[H995|You merely look at me.]] ^3020

[[H2015|You have ruthlessly turned]] [[H7852|on me;  You oppose me]] [[H6108|with Your strong]] [[H3027|hand.]] ^3021

[[H5375|You snatch me up]] [[H413|into]] [[H7307|the wind]] [[H7392|and drive me]] ⟨before it⟩; [[H4127|You toss me about]] [[H7738|in the storm.]] ^3022

[[H3588|Yes,]] [[H3045|I know that]] [[H7725|You will bring me down]] ⟨to⟩ [[H4194|death,]] [[H1004|to the place]] [[H4150|appointed]] [[H3605|for all]] [[H2416|the living.]] ^3023

[[H389|Yet]] [[H3808|no one]] [[H7971|stretches out]] [[H3027|his hand]] [[H1164|to a ruined man]] [[H518|when]] [[H7769|he cries for help]] [[H6365|in his distress.]] ^3024

[[H3808|Have I not]] [[H1058|wept]] [[H7186|for those in trouble?]] [[H5315|Has my soul]] [[H5701|not grieved]] [[H34|for the needy?]] ^3025

[[H3588|But when]] [[H6960|I hoped for]] [[H2896|good,]] [[H7451|evil]] [[H935|came;]] [[H3176|when I looked]] [[H216|for light,]] [[H652|darkness]] [[H935|came.]] ^3026

[[H7570|I am churning]] [[H4578|within]] [[H3808|and cannot]] [[H1826|rest;]] [[H3117|days]] [[H6040|of affliction]] [[H6923|confront me.]] ^3027

[[H1980|I go about]] [[H6937|blackened,]] [[H3808|but not]] [[H2535|by the sun.]] [[H6965|I stand up]] [[H6951|in the assembly]] [[H7768|and cry for help.]] ^3028

[[H1961|I have become]] [[H251|a brother]] [[H8577|to jackals,]] [[H7453|and a companion]] [[H1323|of ostriches.]] ^3029

[[H5785|My skin]] [[H7835|grows black]] [[H4480|and peels,]] [[H6106|and my bones]] [[H2787|burn]] [[H2721|with fever.]] ^3030

[[H3658|My harp]] [[H1961|is tuned]] [[H60|to mourning]] [[H5748|and my flute]] [[H6963|to the sound]] [[H1058|of weeping.]] ^3031

[[H3772|I have made]] [[H1285|a covenant]] [[H5869|with my eyes.]] [[H4100|How then]] [[H995|could I gaze]] ⟨with desire⟩ [[H5921|at]] [[H1330|a virgin?]] ^3101

[[H4100|For what]] ⟨is⟩ [[H2506|the allotment]] [[H433|of God]] [[H4605|from above,]] [[H5159|or the heritage]] [[H7706|from the Almighty]] [[H4791|on high?]] ^3102

[[H3808|Does not]] [[H343|disaster]] [[H5767|come to the unjust]] [[H5235|and calamity]] [[H6466|to workers]] [[H205|of iniquity?]] ^3103

[[H1931|Does He]] [[H3808|not]] [[H7200|see]] [[H1870|my ways]] [[H5608|and count]] [[H3605|my every]] [[H6806|step?]] ^3104

[[H518|If]] [[H1980|I have walked]] [[H5973|in]] [[H7723|falsehood]] [[H7272|or my foot]] [[H2363|has rushed]] [[H5921|to]] [[H4820|deceit,]] ^3105

[[H8254|let God weigh me]] [[H6664|with honest]] [[H3976|scales,]] [[H433|and He]] [[H3045|will know]] [[H8538|my integrity.]] ^3106

[[H518|If]] [[H838|my steps]] [[H5186|have turned]] [[H4480|from]] [[H1870|the path,]] [[H3820|if my heart]] [[H310|has followed]] [[H5869|my eyes,]] [[H3971|or impurity]] [[H1692|has stuck]] [[H3709|to my hands,]] ^3107

[[H312|then may another]] [[H398|eat]] [[H2232|what I have sown,]] [[H6631|and my crops]] [[H8327|be uprooted.]] ^3108

[[H518|If]] [[H3820|my heart]] [[H6601|has been enticed]] [[H5921|by]] [[H7453|my neighbor’s]] [[H802|wife,]] [[H693|or I have lurked]] [[H5921|at]] [[H6607|his door,]] ^3109

[[H802|then may my own wife]] [[H2912|grind grain]] [[H312|for another,]] [[H312|and may other men]] [[H3766|sleep]] [[H5921|with her.]] ^3110

[[H3588|For]] [[H1931|that]] ⟨would be⟩ [[H2154|a heinous crime,]] [[H5771|an iniquity]] [[H6414|to be judged.]] ^3111

[[H3588|For]] [[H1931|it]] [[H784|is a fire]] [[H398|that burns]] [[H5704|down to]] [[H11|Abaddon;]] [[H8327|it would root out]] [[H3605|my entire]] [[H8393|harvest.]] ^3112

[[H518|If]] [[H3988|I have rejected]] [[H4941|the cause]] [[H5650|of my manservant]] [[H519|or maidservant]] [[H7378|when they made a complaint]] [[H5978|against me,]] ^3113

[[H4100|what]] [[H6213|will I do]] [[H3588|when]] [[H410|God]] [[H6965|rises to judge?]] [[H4100|How]] [[H7725|will I answer]] [[H3588|when]] [[H6485|called to account?]] ^3114

[[H3808|Did not]] [[H6213|He who made me]] [[H990|in the womb]] [[H6213|also make them?]] [[H259|Did not the same One]] [[H3559|form us]] [[H7358|in the womb?]] ^3115

[[H518|If]] [[H4513|I have denied]] [[H2656|the desires]] [[H1800|of the poor]] [[H490|or allowed the widow’s]] [[H5869|eyes]] [[H3615|to fail,]] ^3116

[[H398|if I have eaten]] [[H6595|my morsel]] [[H905|alone,]] [[H3808|not]] [[H398|sharing]] [[H4480|it]] [[H3490|with the fatherless—]] ^3117

[[H3588|though]] [[H5271|from my youth]] [[H1431|I reared him]] [[H1|as would a father,]] [[H517|and from my mother's]] [[H990|womb]] [[H5148|I guided —]] ⟨the widow⟩ ^3118

[[H518|if]] [[H7200|I have seen]] [[H6|one perish]] [[H1097|for lack]] [[H3830|of clothing,]] [[H34|or a needy man]] [[H369|without]] [[H3682|a cloak,]] ^3119

[[H518|if]] [[H5130|I have lifted]] [[H3027|up my hand]] [[H5921|against]] [[H3490|the fatherless]] [[H3588|because]] [[H7200|I saw]] [[H5833|that I had support]] [[H8179|in the gate,]] ^3121

[[H248|then may my arm]] [[H5307|fall]] [[H7929|from my shoulder]] [[H7665|and be torn]] [[H7070|from its socket.]] ^3122

[[H3588|For]] [[H343|calamity]] [[H410|from God]] [[H6343|terrifies]] [[H413|me,]] [[H7613|and His splendor]] [[H3808|I cannot]] [[H3201|overpower.]] ^3123

[[H518|If]] [[H7760|I have put]] [[H3689|my trust]] [[H2091|in gold]] [[H559|or called]] [[H3800|pure gold]] [[H4009|my security,]] ^3124

[[H518|if]] [[H8055|I have rejoiced]] [[H3588|in]] [[H7227|my great]] [[H2428|wealth]] [[H3588|because]] [[H3027|my hand]] [[H4672|had gained]] [[H3524|so much,]] ^3125

[[H518|if]] [[H7200|I have regarded]] [[H216|the sun]] [[H1984|in its radiance]] [[H3394|or at the moon]] [[H1980|moving]] [[H3368|in splendor,]] ^3126

[[H3820|so that my heart]] [[H5643|was secretly]] [[H6601|enticed]] [[H3027|and my hand]] [[H5401|threw a kiss]] [[H6310|from my mouth,]] ^3127

[[H1931|this]] [[H1571|would also be]] [[H5771|an iniquity]] [[H6416|to be judged,]] [[H3588|for]] [[H3584|I would have denied]] [[H410|God]] [[H4605|on high.]] ^3128

[[H518|If]] [[H8055|I have rejoiced]] [[H8130|at my enemy’s]] [[H6365|ruin,]] [[H5782|or exulted]] [[H3588|when]] [[H7451|evil]] [[H4672|befell him—]] ^3129

[[H3808|I have not]] [[H5414|allowed]] [[H2441|my mouth]] [[H2398|to sin]] [[H7592|by asking for]] [[H5315|his life]] [[H423|with a curse—]] ^3130

[[H518|if]] [[H4962|the men]] [[H168|of my house]] [[H3808|have not]] [[H559|said,]] [[H4310|‘Who]] [[H5414|is there]] [[H3808|who has not]] [[H7646|had his fill?’—]] ^3131

[[H518|if]] [[H3680|I have covered]] [[H6588|my transgressions]] [[H121|like Adam]] [[H2934|by hiding]] [[H5771|my guilt]] [[H2243|in my heart,]] ^3133

[[H3588|because]] [[H7227|I greatly]] [[H6206|feared]] [[H1995|the crowds,]] [[H937|and the contempt]] [[H4940|of the clans]] [[H2865|terrified me,]] [[H1826|so that I kept silent]] [[H3808|and would not]] [[H3318|go outside—]] ^3134

[[H4310|Oh, that]] [[H5414|I had]] [[H8085|one to hear  me!]] [[H2005|Here is]] [[H8420|my signature—]] [[H7706|let the Almighty]] [[H6030|answer me;]] [[H376|let my accuser]] [[H3789|compose]] [[H5612|His indictment.]] ^3135

[[H518|Surely]] [[H5375|I would carry it]] [[H5921|on]] [[H7926|my shoulder]] [[H6029|and wear]] [[H5850|it like a crown.]] ^3136

[[H5046|I would give]] [[H4557|account]] [[H6806|of all my steps;]] [[H7126|I would approach Him]] [[H3644|like]] [[H5057|a prince.]] ^3137

[[H518|If]] [[H127|my land]] [[H2199|cries out]] [[H5921|against me]] [[H8525|and its furrows]] [[H1058|weep]] [[H3162|together,]] ^3138

[[H2336|then let briers]] [[H3318|grow]] [[H8478|instead of]] [[H2406|wheat]] [[H890|and stinkweed]] [[H8478|instead of]] [[H8184|barley.”]] [[H8552|Thus conclude]] [[H1697|the words]] [[H347|of Job.]] ^3140

[[H428|So these]] [[H7969|three]] [[H582|men]] [[H7673|stopped]] [[H6030|answering]] [[H347|Job,]] [[H3588|because]] [[H1931|he]] [[H6662|was righteous]] [[H5869|in his own eyes.]] ^3201

[[H2734|This kindled]] [[H639|the anger]] [[H453|of Elihu]] [[H1121|son]] [[H1292|of Barachel]] [[H940|the Buzite,]] [[H4940|of the family]] [[H7410|of Ram,]] [[H2734|who burned]] [[H639|with anger]] [[H347|against Job]] [[H5921|for]] [[H6663|justifying]] [[H5315|himself]] [[H430|rather than God.]] ^3202

[[H639|And his anger]] [[H2734|burned]] [[H7969|against Job’s three]] [[H7453|friends,]] [[H5921|because]] [[H3808|they had failed]] [[H4617|to refute]] ⟨Job⟩, [[H7561|and yet had condemned]] [[H347|him.]] ^3203

[[H453|Now Elihu]] [[H2442|had waited]] [[H1697|to speak]] [[H347|to Job]] [[H3588|because]] [[H1992|the others]] [[H2205|were older]] [[H4480|than he.]] ^3204

[[H453|But when he]] [[H7200|saw]] [[H3588|that]] [[H7969|the three]] [[H376|men]] [[H369|had no]] [[H4617|further reply,]] [[H639|his anger]] [[H2734|was aroused.]] ^3205

[[H453|So Elihu]] [[H1121|son]] [[H1292|of Barachel]] [[H940|the Buzite]] [[H6030|declared:]] [[H589|“I]] [[H6810|am young]] [[H3117|in years,]] [[H859|while you]] [[H3453|are old;]] [[H5921|that is why]] [[H2119|I was timid]] [[H3372|and afraid]] [[H2331|to tell you]] [[H1843|what I know.]] ^3206

[[H559|I thought]] [[H3117|that age]] [[H1696|should speak,]] [[H7230|and many]] [[H8141|years]] [[H3045|should teach]] [[H2451|wisdom.]] ^3207

[[H403|But]] ⟨there is⟩ [[H1931|]] [[H7307|a spirit]] [[H582|in a man,]] [[H5397|the breath]] [[H7706|of the Almighty,]] [[H995|that gives him understanding.]] ^3208

[[H3808|It is not only]] [[H7227|the old]] [[H2449|who are wise,]] [[H2205|or the elderly]] [[H995|who understand]] [[H4941|justice.]] ^3209

[[H3651|Therefore]] [[H559|I say,]] [[H8085|‘Listen to me.]] [[H589|I]] [[H637|too]] [[H2331|will declare]] [[H1843|what I know.’]] ^3210

[[H2005|Indeed,]] [[H3176|I waited]] [[H1697|while you spoke;]] [[H238|I listened]] [[H5704|to]] [[H8394|your reasoning;]] [[H5704|as]] [[H2713|you searched]] [[H4405|for words,]] ^3211

[[H995|I paid you full attention.]] [[H369|But no one]] [[H347|proved Job]] [[H3198|wrong;]] [[H4480|not one of]] [[H6030|you rebutted]] [[H561|his arguments.]] ^3212

[[H6435|So do not]] [[H559|claim,]] [[H4672|‘We have found]] [[H2451|wisdom;]] [[H410|let God,]] [[H3808|not]] [[H376|man,]] [[H5086|refute him.’]] ^3213

[[H3588|For]] [[H4390|I am full of]] [[H4405|words,]] [[H7307|and my spirit]] [[H990|within me]] [[H6693|compels me.]] ^3218

[[H2009|Behold,]] [[H990|my belly]] [[H3808|is like unvented]] [[H3196|wine;]] [[H1234|it is about to burst]] [[H2319|like a new]] [[H178|wineskin.]] ^3219

[[H1696|I must speak]] [[H7304|and find relief;]] [[H6605|I must open]] [[H8193|my lips]] [[H6030|and respond.]] ^3220

[[H5375|I will be partial]] [[H408|to no]] [[H376|one,]] [[H3808|nor will]] [[H3655|I flatter]] [[H120|any man.]] ^3221

[[H3588|For]] [[H3808|I do not]] [[H3045|know how]] [[H3655|to flatter,]] [[H6213|or my Maker]] [[H5375|would remove me]] [[H4592|in an instant.]] ^3222

[[H199|But]] [[H4994|now,]] [[H347|Job,]] [[H8085|hear]] [[H4405|my speech,]] [[H238|and listen]] [[H3605|to all]] [[H1697|my words.]] ^3301

[[H2009|Behold]] [[H4994|now,]] [[H6605|I will open]] [[H6310|my mouth;]] [[H1696|what I speak]] [[H2441|is on the tip]] [[H3956|of my tongue.]] ^3302

[[H561|My words]] [[H3476|are from an upright]] [[H3820|heart,]] [[H8193|and my lips]] [[H4448|speak]] [[H1305|sincerely]] [[H1847|what I know.]] ^3303

[[H7307|The Spirit]] [[H410|of God]] [[H6213|has made me,]] [[H5397|and the breath]] [[H7706|of the Almighty]] [[H2421|gives me life.]] ^3304

[[H7725|Refute]] [[H518|me if]] [[H3201|you can;]] [[H6186|prepare your case]] [[H6440|and confront me.]] ^3305

[[H589|I]] [[H410|am just like you before God;]] [[H589|I]] [[H1571|was also]] [[H7169|formed]] [[H2563|out of clay.]] ^3306

[[H2009|Surely]] [[H3808|no]] [[H367|fear of me]] [[H1204|should terrify you;]] [[H3808|nor]] [[H405|will my hand]] [[H3513|be heavy]] [[H5921|upon you.]] ^3307

[[H389|Surely]] [[H559|you have spoken]] [[H241|in my hearing,]] [[H8085|and I have heard]] [[H4405|these very words:]] ^3308

[[H589|‘I]] [[H2134|am pure,]] [[H1097|without]] [[H6588|transgression;]] [[H595|I]] [[H2643|am clean,]] [[H3808|with no]] [[H5771|iniquity]] ^3309

[[H2005|Yet]] [[H4672|He finds]] [[H8569|occasions]] [[H5921|against me;]] [[H2803|He counts me]] [[H341|as His  enemy.]] ^3310

[[H7760|He puts]] [[H7272|my feet]] [[H5465|in the stocks;]] [[H8104|He watches over]] [[H3605|all]] [[H734|my paths.’]] ^3311

[[H2005|Behold,]] [[H3808|you are not]] [[H6663|right]] [[H2063|in this matter.]] [[H6030|I will answer you,]] [[H3588|for]] [[H433|God]] [[H7235|is greater]] [[H582|than man.]] ^3312

[[H4069|Why]] [[H7378|do you contend]] [[H413|with Him]] [[H3588|that]] [[H6030|He answers]] [[H3808|nothing]] [[H1697|a man asks?]] ^3313

[[H3588|For]] [[H410|God]] [[H1696|speaks]] [[H259|in one]] ⟨way⟩ [[H8147|and in another,]] ⟨yet⟩ [[H3808|no one]] [[H7789|notices.]] ^3314

[[H1540|He opens]] [[H241|their ears]] [[H227|at that time]] [[H2856|and terrifies]] [[H4561|them with warnings,]] ^3316

[[H5493|in order to turn]] [[H120|a man]] [[H4639|from wrongdoing]] [[H3680|and keep]] [[H1397|him from]] [[H1466|pride,]] ^3317

[[H2820|to preserve]] [[H5315|his soul]] [[H4480|from]] [[H7845|the Pit,]] [[H2416|and his life]] [[H5674|from perishing]] [[H7973|by the sword.]] ^3318

[[H3198|A man is also chastened]] [[H5921|on]] [[H4904|his bed]] [[H4341|with pain]] [[H386|and constant]] [[H7379|distress]] [[H6106|in his bones,]] ^3319

[[H2416|so that he]] [[H2092|detests]] [[H3899|his bread,]] [[H5315|and his soul]] ⟨loathes⟩ [[H8378|his favorite]] [[H3978|food.]] ^3320

[[H1320|His flesh]] [[H3615|wastes away]] [[H7210|from sight,]] [[H3808|and his hidden]] [[H6106|bones]] [[H8205|protrude.]] ^3321

[[H5315|He]] [[H7126|draws near]] [[H7845|to the Pit,]] [[H2416|and his life]] [[H4191|to the messengers of death.]] ^3322

[[H518|Yet if]] [[H3426|there is]] [[H4397|a messenger]] [[H5921|on his side,]] [[H259|one]] [[H3887|mediator]] [[H4480|out of]] [[H505|a thousand,]] [[H5046|to tell]] [[H120|a man]] [[H3476|what is right for him,]] ^3323

[[H2603|to be gracious]] [[H559|to him and say,]] [[H6308|‘Spare him]] [[H3381|from going down]] [[H7845|to the Pit;]] [[H4672|I have found]] [[H3724|his ransom,’]] ^3324

[[H1320|then his flesh]] [[H7375|will be renewed]] [[H5290|like a child’s,]] [[H7725|and he will return]] [[H3117|to the days]] [[H5934|of his youth.]] ^3325

[[H6279|He will pray]] [[H413|to]] [[H433|God]] [[H7521|and find favor;]] [[H7200|he will see]] [[H6440|His face]] [[H8643|and shout for joy,]] [[H7725|and God will restore]] [[H6666|the righteousness]] [[H582|of that man.]] ^3326

[[H7789|Then he will sing]] [[H5921|before]] [[H582|men]] [[H559|with these words:]] [[H2398|‘I have sinned]] [[H5753|and perverted]] [[H3477|what was right;]] [[H3808|yet I did not]] [[H7737|get what I deserved.]] ^3327

[[H6299|He redeemed]] [[H5315|my soul]] [[H5674|from going down]] [[H7845|to the Pit,]] [[H2416|and I will live]] [[H7200|to see]] [[H216|the light.’]] ^3328

[[H2005|Behold,]] [[H3605|all]] [[H428|these things]] [[H410|God]] [[H6466|does]] [[H5973|to]] [[H1397|a man,]] [[H6471|two]] [[H7969|or even three times,]] ^3329

[[H7725|to bring back]] [[H5315|his soul]] [[H4480|from]] [[H7845|the Pit,]] [[H215|that he may be enlightened]] [[H216|with the light]] [[H2416|of life.]] ^3330

[[H7181|Pay attention,]] [[H347|Job,]] [[H8085|and listen to me;]] [[H2790|be silent,]] [[H595|and I]] [[H1696|will speak.]] ^3331

[[H518|But if]] [[H3426|you have]] [[H4405|something to say,]] [[H7725|answer me;]] [[H1696|speak up,]] [[H3588|for]] [[H2654|I would like]] [[H6663|to vindicate you.]] ^3332

[[H518|But if]] [[H369|not,]] [[H8085|then listen]] [[H2790|to me;  be quiet,]] [[H502|and I will teach]] [[H2451|you wisdom.”]] ^3333

[[H453|Then Elihu]] [[H6030|continued]] [[H559|and said:]] ^3401

[[H8085|“Hear]] [[H4405|my words,]] [[H2450|you wise men;]] [[H238|give ear]] [[H3045|to me,  you men of learning.]] ^3402

[[H3588|For]] [[H241|the ear]] [[H974|tests]] [[H4405|words]] [[H2441|as the mouth]] [[H2938|tastes]] [[H398|food.]] ^3403

[[H977|Let us choose]] [[H4941|for ourselves  what is right;]] [[H3045|let us learn]] [[H996|together]] [[H4100|what]] [[H2896|is good.]] ^3404

[[H3588|For]] [[H347|Job]] [[H559|has declared,]] [[H6663|‘I am righteous,]] [[H410|yet God]] [[H5493|has deprived me of]] [[H4941|justice.]] ^3405

[[H3576|Would I lie]] [[H5921|about]] [[H4941|my case?]] [[H2671|My wound]] [[H605|is incurable,]] [[H1097|though I am without]] [[H6588|transgression.’]] ^3406

[[H4310|What]] [[H1397|man]] [[H347|is like Job,]] ⟨who⟩ [[H8354|drinks up]] [[H3933|derision]] [[H4325|like water?]] ^3407

[[H732|He keeps]] [[H2274|company]] [[H5973|with]] [[H6466|evildoers]] [[H1980|and walks]] [[H5973|with]] [[H7562|wicked]] [[H376|men.]] ^3408

[[H3588|For]] [[H559|he has said,]] [[H5532|‘It profits]] [[H1397|a man]] [[H3808|nothing]] [[H7521|that he should delight]] [[H5973|in]] [[H430|God.’]] ^3409

[[H3651|Therefore]] [[H8085|listen]] [[H376|to me,  you men]] [[H3824|of understanding.]] [[H2486|Far be it]] [[H410|from God]] [[H7562|to do wrong,]] [[H7706|and for the Almighty]] [[H5766|to act unjustly.]] ^3410

[[H3588|For]] [[H6467|according to a man's deeds,]] [[H7999|He repays him;]] [[H376|according to a man's]] [[H734|ways,]] [[H4672|He brings consequences.]] ^3411

[[H637|Indeed,]] [[H551|it is true]] [[H410|that God]] [[H3808|does not]] [[H7561|act wickedly]] [[H7706|and the Almighty]] [[H3808|does not]] [[H5791|pervert]] [[H4941|justice.]] ^3412

[[H4310|Who]] [[H6485|gave Him charge]] [[H776|over the earth?]] [[H4310|Who]] [[H7760|appointed]] ⟨Him⟩ ⟨over⟩ [[H3605|the whole]] [[H8398|world?]] ^3413

[[H518|If]] [[H7760|He were to set]] [[H3820|His heart]] [[H413|to it]] [[H622|and withdraw]] [[H7307|His Spirit]] [[H5397|and breath,]] ^3414

[[H3605|all]] [[H1320|flesh]] [[H1478|would perish]] [[H3162|together]] [[H120|and mankind]] [[H7725|would return]] [[H5921|to]] [[H6083|the dust.]] ^3415

[[H518|If]] [[H998|you have understanding,]] [[H8085|hear]] [[H2063|this;]] [[H238|listen to]] [[H4405|my words.]] ^3416

[[H637|Could]] [[H8130|one who hates]] [[H4941|justice]] [[H2280|govern?]] [[H7561|Will you condemn]] [[H6662|the just]] [[H3524|and mighty One,]] ^3417

[[H559|who says]] [[H4428|to kings,]] [[H1100|‘ worthless!’]] ⟨You are⟩ [[H413|and to]] [[H5081|nobles,]] [[H7563|‘ wicked,’]] ⟨You are⟩ ^3418

[[H834|who]] [[H3808|is not]] [[H5375|partial]] [[H8269|to princes]] [[H3808|and does not]] [[H5234|favor]] [[H7771|rich]] [[H6440|over]] [[H1800|poor?]] [[H3588|For]] [[H3605|they are all]] [[H4639|the work]] [[H3027|of His hands.]] ^3419

[[H4191|They die]] [[H7281|in a moment,]] [[H2676|and at midnight;]] [[H5971|the people]] [[H1607|convulse]] [[H5674|and pass away;]] [[H47|the mighty]] [[H5493|are removed]] [[H3808|without]] [[H3027|human hand.]] ^3420

[[H3588|For]] [[H5869|His eyes]] ⟨are⟩ [[H5921|on]] [[H1870|the ways]] [[H376|of man,]] [[H7200|and He sees]] [[H6806|his every step.]] ^3421

[[H369|There is no]] [[H2822|darkness]] ⟨or⟩ [[H369|]] [[H6757|deep shadow]] [[H8033|where]] [[H6466|the workers]] [[H205|of iniquity]] [[H5641|can hide.]] ^3422

[[H3588|For]] [[H410|God]] [[H3808|need not]] [[H7760|examine]] [[H376|a man]] [[H5750|further,]] [[H1980|for one to approach Him]] [[H4941|in judgment.]] ^3423

[[H7489|He shatters]] [[H3524|the mighty]] [[H3808|without]] [[H2714|inquiry]] [[H5975|and sets up]] [[H312|others]] [[H8478|in their place.]] ^3424

[[H3651|Therefore,]] [[H5234|He recognizes]] [[H4566|their deeds;]] [[H2015|He overthrows]] ⟨them⟩ [[H3915|in the night]] [[H1792|and they are crushed.]] ^3425

[[H5606|He strikes]] [[H8478|them for]] [[H7563|their wickedness]] [[H4725|in full]] [[H7200|view,]] ^3426

[[H834|because]] [[H5493|they turned aside]] [[H310|from Him]] [[H3808|and had no]] [[H7919|regard]] [[H3605|for any]] [[H1870|of His ways.]] ^3427

[[H6818|They caused the cry]] [[H1800|of the poor]] [[H935|to come]] [[H5921|before Him,]] [[H8085|and He heard]] [[H6818|the outcry]] [[H6041|of the afflicted.]] ^3428

[[H1931|But when He]] [[H8252|remains silent,]] [[H4310|who]] [[H7561|can condemn Him?]] [[H5641|When He hides]] [[H6440|His face,]] [[H4310|who]] [[H7789|can see Him?]] [[H5921|Yet He watches over]] [[H3162|both]] [[H120|man]] [[H1471|and nation,]] ^3429

[[H2611|that godless]] [[H120|men]] [[H4427|should not rule]] [[H4170|or lay snares]] [[H5971|for the people.]] ^3430

[[H3588|Suppose]] [[H559|someone says]] [[H413|to]] [[H410|God,]] [[H5375|‘I have endured my punishment;]] [[H2254|I will offend]] [[H3808|no more.]] ^3431

[[H3384|Teach]] [[H1107|me what I cannot]] [[H2372|see;]] [[H518|if]] [[H6466|I have done]] [[H5766|wrong,]] [[H3808|I will not]] [[H3254|do it again.’]] ^3432

[[H7999|Should God repay you]] [[H5973|on your own terms]] [[H3588|when]] [[H3988|you have disavowed His?]] [[H859|You]] [[H977|must choose,]] [[H3808|not]] [[H589|I;]] [[H1696|so tell me]] [[H4100|what]] [[H3045|you know.]] ^3433

[[H582|Men]] [[H3824|of understanding]] [[H559|will declare]] [[H2450|to me,  and the wise]] [[H1397|men]] [[H8085|who hear]] ^3434

[[H15|If only]] [[H347|Job]] [[H974|were tried]] [[H5704|to]] [[H5331|the utmost]] [[H5921|for]] [[H8666|answering]] [[H205|like a wicked]] [[H376|man.]] ^3436

[[H3588|For]] [[H3254|he adds]] [[H6588|rebellion]] [[H5921|to]] [[H2403|his sin;]] [[H5606|he claps]] ⟨his hands⟩ [[H996|among us]] [[H7235|and multiplies]] [[H561|his words]] [[H410|against God.]] ^3437

[[H453|And Elihu]] [[H6030|went on]] [[H559|to say:]] ^3501

[[H2803|“Do you think]] [[H2063|it]] [[H4941|is just]] [[H559|when you say,]] [[H6664|‘I am righteous]] [[H410|before God.’?]] ^3502

[[H5027|Look]] [[H8064|to the heavens]] [[H7200|and see;]] [[H7789|gaze]] [[H7834|at the clouds]] [[H1361|high]] [[H4480|above you.]] ^3505

[[H518|If]] [[H2398|you sin,]] [[H4100|what]] [[H6466|do you accomplish]] [[H7231|against Him?  If you multiply]] [[H6588|your transgressions,]] [[H4100|what]] [[H6213|do you do]] ^3506

[[H7562|Your wickedness]] [[H376|affects only a man]] [[H3644|like yourself,]] [[H6666|and your righteousness]] [[H1121|only a son]] [[H120|of men.]] ^3508

[[H2199|Men cry out]] [[H7230|under great]] [[H6217|oppression;]] [[H7768|they plead for relief]] [[H2220|from the arm]] [[H7227|of the mighty.]] ^3509

[[H3808|But no]] [[H559|one asks,]] [[H335|‘Where]] ⟨is⟩ [[H433|God]] [[H6213|my Maker,]] [[H5414|who gives us]] [[H2158|songs]] [[H3915|in the night,]] ^3510

[[H2416|The wild animals]] [[H935|enter]] [[H695|their lairs;]] [[H7931|they settle down]] [[H4585|in their dens.]] ^3708

[[H2959|He loads]] [[H5645|the clouds]] [[H7377|with moisture;]] [[H6327|He scatters]] [[H216|His lightning]] [[H6051|through them.]] ^3711

[[H1931|They]] [[H4524|swirl about,]] [[H2015|turning round and round]] [[H8458|at His direction,]] [[H6467|accomplishing]] [[H3605|all]] [[H834|that]] [[H6680|He commands]] [[H5921|over]] [[H6440|the face]] [[H8398|of all]] [[H776|the earth.]] ^3712

[[H3045|Teach]] [[H4100|us what]] [[H559|we should say]] [[H3808|to Him;  we cannot]] [[H6186|draw up our case]] [[H6440|when our faces]] [[H2822|are in darkness.]] ^3719

[[H5608|Should He be told]] [[H3588|that]] [[H1696|I want to speak?]] [[H376|Would a man]] [[H559|ask]] [[H1104|to be swallowed up?]] ^3720

[[H6258|Now]] [[H3808|no one]] [[H7200|can gaze]] [[H216|at the sun]] ⟨when⟩ [[H1931|it]] ⟨is⟩ [[H925|bright]] [[H7834|in the skies]] [[H7307|after the wind]] [[H5674|has swept]] [[H2891|them clean.]] ^3721

[[H3671|The wings]] [[H7443|of the ostrich]] [[H5965|flap joyfully,]] [[H518|but cannot]] ⟨match⟩ [[H84|the pinions]] [[H5133|and feathers]] [[H2624|of the stork.]] ^3913

[[H3588|For]] [[H5800|she leaves]] [[H1000|her eggs]] [[H776|on the ground]] [[H2552|and lets them warm]] [[H5921|in]] [[H6083|the sand.]] ^3914

[[H7911|She forgets]] [[H3588|that]] [[H7272|a foot]] [[H2115|may crush them,]] [[H7704|or a wild]] [[H2416|animal]] [[H1758|may trample them.]] ^3915

[[H1121|She treats her young]] [[H7188|harshly,]] [[H3808|as if not]] [[H1097|her own,  with no]] [[H6343|concern]] [[H3018|that her labor]] [[H7385|was in vain.]] ^3916

[[H3588|For]] [[H433|God]] [[H5382|has deprived her]] [[H2451|of wisdom;]] [[H3808|He has not]] [[H2505|endowed]] [[H998|her  with understanding.]] ^3917

[[H6256|Yet when]] [[H4791|she proudly]] [[H4754|spreads her wings,]] [[H7832|she laughs]] [[H5483|at the horse]] [[H7392|and its rider.]] ^3918

[[H5414|Do you give]] [[H1369|strength]] [[H5483|to the horse]] [[H3847|or adorn]] [[H6677|his neck]] [[H7483|with a mane?]] ^3919

[[H7493|Do you make him leap]] [[H697|like a locust,]] ⟨striking⟩ [[H367|terror]] [[H1935|with his proud]] [[H5170|snorting?]] ^3920

[[H2658|He paws]] [[H6010|in the valley]] [[H7797|and rejoices]] [[H3581|in his strength;]] [[H3318|he charges]] [[H5402|into battle.]] ^3921

[[H7832|He laughs]] [[H6343|at fear,]] [[H2865|frightened]] [[H3808|of nothing;]] [[H3808|he does not]] [[H7725|turn back]] [[H6440|from]] [[H2719|the sword.]] ^3922

[[H827|A quiver]] [[H7439|rattles]] [[H5921|at his side,]] [[H3851|along with a flashing]] [[H2595|spear]] [[H3591|and lance.]] ^3923

[[H7494|Trembling]] [[H7267|with excitement,]] [[H1572|he devours]] [[H776|the distance;]] [[H3808|he cannot]] [[H539|stand still]] [[H7782|when the trumpet]] [[H6963|sounds.]] ^3924

[[H1767|At]] [[H7782|the the trumpet,]] ⟨blast of⟩ [[H559|he snorts]] [[H1889|with fervor!]] [[H7306|He catches the scent]] [[H4421|of battle]] [[H7350|from afar,]] [[H7482|the shouts]] [[H8269|of captains]] [[H8643|and the cry of battle.]] ^3925

[[H5322|Does the hawk]] [[H82|take flight]] [[H998|by your understanding]] [[H6566|and spread]] [[H3671|his wings]] [[H8486|toward the south?]] ^3926

[[H5404|Does the eagle]] [[H1361|soar]] [[H5921|at]] [[H6310|your command]] [[H7064|and make his nest]] [[H7311|on high?]] ^3927

[[H7931|He dwells]] [[H5553|on a cliff]] [[H3885|and lodges there;]] [[H4686|his stronghold]] [[H5921|is on]] [[H5553|a rocky]] [[H8127|crag.]] ^3928

[[H8033|From there]] [[H2658|he spies]] [[H400|out food;]] [[H5869|his eyes]] [[H5027|see]] ⟨it⟩ [[H7350|from afar.]] ^3929

[[H667|His young ones]] [[H5966|feast on]] [[H1818|blood;]] [[H834|and where]] [[H2491|the slain]] ⟨are⟩, [[H8033|there]] [[H1931|he.”]] ⟨is⟩ ^3930

[[H3068|And the LORD]] [[H6030|said]] [[H347|to Job:]] ^4001

[[H3250|“Will the faultfinder]] [[H7378|contend]] [[H5973|with]] [[H7706|the Almighty?]] [[H3198|Let him who argues]] [[H433|with God]] [[H6030|give an answer.”]] ^4002

[[H347|Then Job]] [[H6030|answered]] [[H3068|the LORD:]] ^4003

[[H2005|“Behold,]] [[H7043|I am insignificant.]] [[H4100|How]] [[H7725|can I reply to You?]] [[H7760|I place]] [[H3027|my hand]] [[H3926|over]] [[H6310|my mouth.]] ^4004

[[H1696|I have spoken]] [[H259|once,]] [[H3808|but I have no]] [[H6030|answer—]] [[H8147|twice,]] [[H3808|but I have nothing]] [[H3254|to add.”]] ^4005

[[H3068|Then the LORD]] [[H6030|answered]] [[H347|Job]] [[H4480|out of]] [[H5591|the whirlwind]] [[H559|and said:]] ^4006

[[H4994|“Now]] [[H247|brace]] [[H2504|yourself]] [[H1397|like a man;]] [[H7592|I will question you,]] [[H3045|and you shall answer Me.]] ^4007

[[H637|Would you really]] [[H6565|annul]] [[H4941|My justice?]] [[H7561|Would you condemn Me]] [[H4616|to]] [[H6663|justify yourself?]] ^4008

[[H2220|Do you have an arm]] [[H410|like God’s?]] [[H7481|Can you thunder]] [[H6963|with a voice]] [[H3644|like His?]] ^4009

[[H4994|Then]] [[H5710|adorn yourself]] ⟨with⟩ [[H1347|majesty]] [[H1363|and splendor,]] [[H3847|and clothe]] [[H1935|yourself with honor]] [[H1926|and glory.]] ^4010

[[H6327|Unleash]] [[H5678|the fury]] [[H639|of your wrath;]] [[H7200|look on]] [[H3605|every]] [[H1343|proud man]] [[H8213|and bring him low.]] ^4011

[[H7200|Look on]] [[H3605|every]] [[H1343|proud man]] [[H3665|and humble him;]] [[H1915|trample]] [[H7563|the wicked]] [[H8478|where they stand.]] ^4012

[[H2934|Bury]] [[H3162|them together]] [[H6083|in the dust;]] [[H2280|imprison them]] [[H2934|in the grave.]] ^4013

[[H1571|Then]] [[H589|I]] [[H3034|will confess to you]] [[H3588|that]] [[H3225|your own right hand]] [[H3467|can save]] ^4014

[[H2009|Look at]] [[H930|Behemoth,]] [[H834|which]] [[H6213|I made]] ⟨along⟩ [[H5973|with you.]] [[H398|He feeds on]] [[H2682|grass]] [[H1241|like an ox.]] ^4015

[[H2009|See]] [[H3581|the strength]] [[H4975|of his loins]] [[H202|and the power]] [[H8306|in the muscles]] [[H990|of his belly.]] ^4016

[[H2180|His tail]] [[H2654|sways]] [[H3644|like]] [[H730|a cedar;]] [[H1517|the sinews]] [[H6344|of  his thighs]] [[H8276|are tightly knit.]] ^4017

[[H6106|His bones]] [[H650|are tubes]] [[H5154|of bronze;]] [[H1634|his limbs]] [[H4300|are rods]] [[H1270|of iron.]] ^4018

[[H1931|He]] [[H7225|is the foremost]] [[H410|of God’s]] [[H1870|works;]] [[H6213|only his Maker]] [[H2719|can draw the sword]] [[H5066|against him.]] ^4019

[[H2022|The hills]] [[H5375|yield]] [[H944|him  their produce,]] [[H3605|while all]] [[H2416|the beasts]] [[H7704|of the field]] [[H7832|play]] [[H8033|nearby.]] ^4020

[[H7901|He lies]] [[H8478|under]] [[H6628|the lotus plants,]] [[H5643|hidden]] [[H7070|among the reeds]] [[H1207|of the marsh.]] ^4021

[[H6628|The lotus plants]] [[H5526|conceal him]] [[H6752|in their shade;]] [[H6155|the willows]] [[H5158|of the brook]] [[H5437|surround him.]] ^4022

[[H2005|Though]] [[H5104|the river]] [[H6231|rages,]] [[H3808|Behemoth is unafraid;]] [[H982|he remains secure,]] [[H3588|though]] [[H3383|the Jordan]] [[H1518|surges]] [[H413|to]] [[H6310|his mouth.]] ^4023

[[H3947|Can anyone capture him]] [[H5869|as he looks on,]] [[H5344|or pierce]] [[H639|his nose]] [[H4170|with a snare?]] ^4024

[[H4900|Can you pull in]] [[H3882|Leviathan]] [[H2443|with a hook]] [[H3956|or tie down his tongue]] [[H2256|with a rope?]] ^4101

[[H7760|Can you put]] [[H100|a cord]] [[H639|through his nose]] [[H5344|or pierce]] [[H3895|his jaw]] [[H2336|with a hook?]] ^4102

[[H7235|Will he beg]] [[H413|you]] [[H8469|for mercy]] [[H518|or]] [[H1696|speak]] [[H413|to you]] [[H7390|softly?]] ^4103

[[H3772|Will he make]] [[H1285|a covenant]] [[H5973|with you]] [[H3947|to take him]] [[H5650|as a slave]] [[H5769|for life?]] ^4104

[[H7832|Can you pet him]] [[H6833|like a bird]] [[H7194|or put him on a leash]] [[H5291|for your maidens?]] ^4105

[[H2271|Will traders]] [[H3738|barter]] [[H5921|for him]] [[H2673|or divide him]] [[H996|among]] [[H3669|the merchants?]] ^4106

[[H4390|Can you fill]] [[H5785|his hide]] [[H7905|with harpoons]] [[H7218|or his head]] [[H1709|with fishing]] [[H6767|spears?]] ^4107

[[H7760|If you lay]] [[H3709|a hand]] [[H5921|on him,]] [[H2142|you will remember]] [[H4421|the battle]] [[H408|and never]] [[H3254|repeat it!]] ^4108

[[H2005|Surely]] [[H8431|hope of him]] ⟨overcoming⟩ [[H3576|is false.]] [[H1571|Is not]] [[H4758|the sight of him]] [[H2904|overwhelming?]] ^4109

[[H3808|No one]] [[H393|is ferocious]] [[H3588|enough to]] [[H5782|rouse Leviathan.]] [[H4310|Then who]] [[H3320|is able to stand]] [[H6440|against Me?]] ^4110

[[H4310|Who]] [[H6923|has given to Me]] [[H7999|that I should repay him?]] [[H3605|Everything]] [[H8478|under]] [[H8064|heaven]] [[H1931|is]] ^4111

[[H3808|I cannot]] [[H2790|keep silent]] [[H905|about his limbs,]] [[H1369|his power]] [[H2433|and his graceful]] [[H6187|form.]] ^4112

[[H4310|Who]] [[H1540|can strip off]] [[H6440|his outer]] [[H3830|coat?]] [[H4310|Who]] [[H935|can approach]] ⟨him⟩ [[H3718|with a bridle?]] ^4113

[[H4310|Who]] [[H6605|can open]] [[H1817|his jaws,]] [[H5439|ringed]] [[H367|by his fearsome]] [[H8127|teeth?]] ^4114

⟨His⟩ [[H650|rows]] [[H4043|of scales are]] ⟨his⟩ [[H1346|pride,]] [[H5462|tightly]] [[H2368|sealed together.]] ^4115

[[H259|One scale]] [[H5066|is so near]] [[H259|to another]] [[H3808|that no]] [[H7307|air]] [[H935|can pass]] [[H996|between them.]] ^4116

[[H1692|They are joined]] [[H376|to one]] [[H251|another;]] [[H3920|they clasp]] [[H3808|and cannot]] [[H6504|be separated.]] ^4117

[[H5846|His snorting]] [[H1984|flashes]] [[H216|with light,]] [[H5869|and his eyes]] [[H6079|are like the rays]] [[H7837|of dawn.]] ^4118

[[H3940|Firebrands]] [[H1980|stream]] [[H6310|from his mouth;]] [[H784|fiery]] [[H3590|sparks]] [[H4422|shoot forth!]] ^4119

[[H6227|Smoke]] [[H3318|billows]] [[H5156|from his nostrils]] [[H5301|as from a boiling]] [[H1731|pot]] [[H100|over burning reeds.]] ^4120

[[H5315|His breath]] [[H1513|sets coals]] [[H3857|ablaze,]] [[H3851|and flames]] [[H3318|pour out]] [[H6310|of his mouth.]] ^4121

[[H5797|Strength]] [[H3885|resides]] [[H6677|in his neck,]] [[H1670|and dismay]] [[H1750|leaps]] [[H6440|before him.]] ^4122

[[H4651|The folds]] [[H1320|of his flesh]] [[H1692|are tightly joined;]] [[H3332|they are firm]] [[H1077|and immovable.]] ^4123

[[H3820|His chest]] [[H3332|is as hard]] [[H3644|as]] [[H68|a rock,]] [[H3332|as hard]] [[H8482|as a lower]] [[H6400|millstone!]] ^4124

[[H7613|When Leviathan rises up,]] [[H410|the mighty]] [[H1481|are terrified;]] [[H2398|they withdraw]] [[H7667|before his thrashing.]] ^4125

[[H2719|The sword]] [[H5381|that reaches him]] [[H1097|has no]] [[H6965|effect,]] [[H2595|nor does the spear]] [[H4551|or dart]] [[H8302|or arrow.]] ^4126

[[H2803|He regards]] [[H1270|iron]] [[H8401|as straw]] [[H5154|and bronze]] [[H7539|as rotten]] [[H6086|wood.]] ^4127

[[H3808|No]] [[H7198|arrow]] [[H1272|can make him flee;]] [[H68|slingstones]] [[H2015|become]] [[H7179|like chaff]] ^4128

[[H8455|A club]] [[H2803|is regarded]] [[H7179|as straw,]] [[H7832|and he laughs]] [[H7494|at the sound]] [[H3591|of the lance.]] ^4129

[[H8478|His undersides]] [[H2303|are jagged]] [[H2789|potsherds,]] [[H7502|spreading out]] [[H2916|the mud]] [[H2742|like a threshing sledge.]] ^4130

[[H4688|He makes the depths]] [[H7570|seethe]] [[H5518|like a cauldron;]] [[H7760|he makes]] [[H3220|the sea]] [[H4841|like a jar of ointment.]] ^4131

[[H215|He leaves a glistening]] [[H5410|wake]] [[H310|behind him;]] [[H2803|one would think]] [[H8415|the deep]] [[H7872|had white hair!]] ^4132

[[H369|Nothing]] [[H5921|on]] [[H6083|earth]] [[H4915|is his equal—]] [[H6213|a creature]] [[H1097|devoid of]] [[H2844|fear!]] ^4133

[[H7200|He looks down]] [[H3605|on all]] [[H1364|the haughty;]] [[H1931|he]] [[H4428|is king]] [[H5921|over]] [[H3605|all]] [[H1121|the proud.”]] ^4134

[[H347|Then Job]] [[H6030|replied]] [[H3068|to the LORD:]] ^4201

[[H3045|“I know]] [[H3588|that]] [[H3201|You can do]] [[H3605|all things]] [[H3808|and that no]] [[H4209|plan]] [[H4480|of Yours]] [[H1219|can be thwarted.]] ^4202

[[H4310|You asked, ‘Who]] [[H2088|is this]] [[H5956|who conceals]] [[H6098|My counsel]] [[H1097|without]] [[H1847|knowledge?’]] [[H3651|Surely]] [[H5046|I spoke of things]] [[H3808|I did not]] [[H995|understand,]] [[H6381|things too wonderful]] [[H4480|for]] [[H3045|me to know.]] ^4203

[[H8085|You said, ‘Listen]] [[H4994|now,]] [[H595|and I]] [[H1696|will speak.]] [[H7592|I will question you,]] [[H3045|and you shall answer Me.’]] ^4204

[[H8085|My ears]] [[H8088|had heard of You,]] [[H6258|but now]] [[H5869|my eyes]] [[H7200|have seen You.]] ^4205

[[H310|After]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H1696|had spoken]] [[H428|these]] [[H1697|words]] [[H413|to]] [[H347|Job,]] [[H3068|He]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H464|Eliphaz]] [[H8489|the Temanite,]] [[H639|“My wrath]] [[H2734|is kindled]] [[H8147|against you  and your two]] [[H7453|friends.]] [[H3588|For]] [[H3808|you have not]] [[H1696|spoken]] [[H413|about Me]] [[H3559|accurately,]] [[H5650|as My servant]] [[H347|Job has.]] ^4207

[[H347|After Job]] [[H6419|had prayed]] [[H1157|for]] [[H7453|his friends,]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H7725|restored]] [[H7622|his prosperity]] [[H3254|and doubled]] [[H347|his]] [[H3605|former possessions.]] ^4210

[[H3605|All]] [[H251|his brothers]] [[H269|and sisters]] [[H6440|and prior]] [[H3045|acquaintances]] [[H935|came]] [[H398|and dined]] [[H5973|with him]] [[H1004|in his house.]] [[H5110|They consoled]] [[H5162|him  and comforted]] [[H853|him]] [[H5921|over]] [[H3605|all]] [[H7451|the adversity]] [[H834|that]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H935|had brought]] [[H5921|upon him.]] [[H376|And each]] [[H5414|one gave]] [[H259|him  a]] [[H7192|piece of silver]] [[H259|and a]] [[H2091|gold]] [[H5141|ring.]] ^4211
