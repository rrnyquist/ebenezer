[[H7970|In the thirtieth]] [[H8141|year,]] [[H7243|in the fourth month,]] [[H2568|on the fifth]] [[H2320|day,]] [[H589|while I]] [[H8432|was among]] [[H1473|the exiles]] [[H5921|by]] [[H5104|the River]] [[H3529|Kebar,]] [[H8064|the heavens]] [[H6605|opened]] [[H7200|and I saw]] [[H4759|visions]] [[H430|of God.]] ^0101

[[H2568|On the fifth]] [[H2320|day of the month—]] [[H1931|it]] [[H2549|was the fifth]] [[H8141|year]] [[H1546|of the exile]] [[H4428|of King]] [[H3112|Jehoiachin—]] ^0102

[[H1697|the word]] [[H3068|of the LORD]] [[H1961|came]] [[H1961|directly]] [[H413|to]] [[H3168|Ezekiel]] [[H3548|the priest,]] [[H1121|the son]] [[H941|of Buzi,]] [[H776|in the land]] [[H3778|of the Chaldeans]] [[H5921|by]] [[H3529|the Kebar]] [[H5104|River.]] [[H8033|And there]] [[H3068|the LORD’s]] [[H3027|hand]] [[H1961|was]] [[H5921|upon him.]] ^0103

[[H7200|I looked]] [[H2009|and saw]] [[H7307|a whirlwind]] [[H935|coming]] [[H4480|from]] [[H6828|the north,]] [[H1419|a great]] [[H6051|cloud]] [[H784|with fire]] [[H3947|flashing back and forth]] [[H5051|and brilliant light]] [[H5439|all around it.]] [[H8432|In the center]] [[H784|of the fire]] [[H5869|was a glow]] [[H2830|like amber,]] ^0104

[[H8432|and within it]] ⟨was⟩ [[H1823|the form]] [[H702|of four]] [[H2416|living creatures.]] [[H2088|And this]] ⟨was⟩ [[H4758|their appearance:]] [[H2007|They had]] [[H120|a human]] [[H1823|form,]] ^0105

[[H259|but each]] [[H702|had four]] [[H6440|faces]] [[H702|and four]] [[H3671|wings.]] ^0106

[[H7272|Their legs]] [[H3477|were straight,]] [[H3709|and the soles]] [[H7272|of their feet]] [[H3709|were like the hooves]] [[H5695|of a calf,]] [[H5340|gleaming]] [[H5869|like]] [[H7044|polished]] [[H5178|bronze.]] ^0107

[[H8478|Under]] [[H3671|their wings]] [[H5921|on]] [[H702|their four]] [[H7253|sides]] [[H120|they had human]] [[H3027|hands.]] [[H702|All four]] [[H6440|of them had faces]] [[H3671|and wings,]] ^0108

[[H3671|and their wings]] [[H2266|were touching]] [[H413|one]] [[H269|another.]] [[H3808|They did not]] [[H5437|turn]] [[H1980|as they moved;]] [[H376|each]] [[H1980|one went]] [[H5676|straight]] [[H6440|ahead.]] ^0109

[[H1823|The form]] [[H6440|of their faces]] [[H6440|was that]] [[H120|of a man,]] [[H702|and each of the four]] [[H6440|had the face]] [[H738|of a lion]] [[H413|on]] [[H3225|the right side,]] [[H6440|the face]] [[H7794|of an ox]] [[H8040|on the left side,]] [[H702|and also]] [[H6440|the face]] [[H5404|of an eagle.]] ^0110

[[H6440|Such were their faces.]] [[H3671|Their wings]] [[H6504|were spread]] [[H4605|upward;]] [[H376|each]] ⟨had⟩ [[H8147|two]] ⟨wings⟩ [[H2266|touching]] [[H376|the wings of the creature on either side,]] [[H8147|and two]] [[H3680|wings covering]] [[H853|its]] [[H1472|body.]] ^0111

[[H376|Each]] ⟨creature⟩ [[H1980|went]] [[H413|straight ahead.]] [[H413|Wherever]] [[H7307|the spirit]] [[H1980|would go,]] [[H1980|they would go,]] [[H3808|without]] [[H5437|turning]] [[H1980|as they moved.]] ^0112

[[H1823|In the midst]] [[H2416|of the living creatures]] [[H4758|was the appearance]] [[H784|of glowing]] [[H1513|coals]] [[H1197|of fire,]] ⟨or⟩ [[H4758|]] [[H3940|of torches.]] [[H784|Fire]] [[H1980|moved back and forth]] [[H996|between]] [[H2416|the living creatures;]] [[H5051|it was bright,]] [[H1300|and lightning]] [[H3318|flashed]] [[H4480|out of]] [[H784|it.]] ^0113

[[H2416|The creatures]] [[H7519|were darting back and forth]] [[H4758|as quickly as]] [[H965|flashes of lightning.]] ^0114

[[H7200|When I looked]] [[H2416|at the living creatures,]] [[H2009|I saw]] [[H259|a]] [[H212|wheel]] [[H776|on the ground]] [[H681|beside]] [[H2416|each creature]] [[H702|with its four]] [[H6440|faces.]] ^0115

[[H4639|The workmanship]] [[H212|of the wheels]] [[H4758|looked like]] [[H5869|the gleam]] [[H8658|of beryl,]] [[H702|and all four]] [[H259|had the same]] [[H1823|likeness.]] [[H4639|Their workmanship]] [[H4758|looked]] [[H834|like]] [[H212|a wheel]] [[H8432|within]] [[H212|a wheel.]] ^0116

[[H1980|As they moved,]] [[H1980|they went]] [[H5921|in]] [[H702|any of the four]] [[H7253|directions,]] [[H3808|without]] [[H5437|pivoting]] [[H1980|as they moved.]] ^0117

[[H1354|Their rims]] [[H1363|were high]] [[H3374|and awesome,]] [[H702|and all four]] [[H1354|rims]] [[H4392|were full of]] [[H5869|eyes]] [[H5439|all around.]] ^0118

[[H2416|So as the living creatures]] [[H1980|moved,]] [[H212|the wheels]] [[H1980|moved]] [[H681|beside them,]] [[H2416|and when the creatures]] [[H5375|rose]] [[H5921|from]] [[H776|the ground,]] [[H212|the wheels]] [[H5375|also rose.]] ^0119

[[H5921|Wherever]] [[H7307|the spirit]] [[H1980|would go,]] [[H1980|they would go,]] [[H212|and the wheels]] [[H5375|would rise]] [[H5980|alongside them,]] [[H3588|because]] [[H7307|the spirit]] [[H2416|of the living creatures]] [[H212|was in the wheels.]] ^0120

[[H1980|When the creatures moved,]] [[H1980|the wheels moved;]] [[H5975|when the creatures stood still,]] [[H5975|the wheels stood still;]] [[H5375|and when the creatures rose]] [[H5921|from]] [[H776|the ground,]] [[H212|the wheels]] [[H5375|rose]] [[H5980|alongside them,]] [[H3588|because]] [[H7307|the spirit]] [[H2416|of the living creatures]] [[H212|was in the wheels.]] ^0121

[[H5186|Spread out]] [[H5921|above]] [[H7218|the heads]] [[H2416|of the living creatures]] ⟨was⟩ [[H1823|the shape]] [[H3372|on an awesome]] [[H7549|expanse,]] [[H5869|gleaming]] [[H7140|like crystal.]] ^0122

[[H8478|And under]] [[H7549|the expanse,]] [[H3671|their wings]] [[H3477|stretched out]] [[H413|toward]] [[H802|one]] [[H269|another.]] [[H376|Each one]] [[H8147|also had two]] [[H3680|wings covering]] [[H1472|its body.]] ^0123

[[H1980|When moved,]] ⟨the creatures⟩ [[H8085|I heard]] [[H6963|the sound]] [[H3671|of their wings]] [[H6963|like the roar]] [[H7227|of many]] [[H4325|waters,]] [[H6963|like the voice]] [[H7706|of the Almighty,]] [[H6963|like]] [[H1999|the tumult]] [[H4264|of an army.]] [[H5975|When they stood still,]] [[H7503|they lowered]] [[H3671|their wings.]] ^0124

[[H5975|And as they stood still]] [[H3671|with their wings]] [[H7503|lowered,]] [[H6963|a voice]] [[H1961|came]] [[H5921|from above]] [[H7549|the expanse]] [[H834|that]] ⟨was⟩ [[H5921|over]] [[H7218|their heads.]] ^0125

[[H4605|Above]] [[H7549|the expanse]] [[H5921|over]] [[H7218|their heads]] ⟨was⟩ [[H834|]] [[H1823|the likeness]] [[H3678|of a throne]] [[H4758|with the appearance]] [[H5601|of sapphire,]] ⟨and⟩ [[H3678|on the throne]] [[H5921|high above]] [[H1823|was a figure]] [[H4758|like that]] [[H120|of a man.]] ^0126

[[H4758|From what seemed]] [[H4975|to be His waist]] [[H4605|up,]] [[H7200|I saw]] [[H5869|a gleam]] [[H2830|like amber,]] [[H4758|with what looked]] [[H784|like fire]] [[H1004|within]] [[H5439|it  all around.]] [[H4758|And from what seemed]] [[H4975|to be His waist]] [[H4295|down,]] [[H7200|I saw]] [[H4758|what looked]] [[H784|like fire;]] [[H5051|and brilliant light]] [[H5439|surrounded Him.]] ^0127

[[H4758|The appearance]] [[H5051|of the brilliant light]] [[H5439|all around Him]] [[H4758|was like that]] [[H7198|of a rainbow]] [[H6051|in a cloud]] [[H1653|on a rainy]] [[H3117|day.]] [[H1931|This]] [[H4758|was the appearance]] [[H1823|of the likeness]] [[H3519|of the glory]] [[H3068|of the LORD.]] [[H7200|And when I saw it,]] [[H5307|I fell]] [[H5921|facedown]] [[H8085|and heard]] [[H6963|a voice]] [[H1696|speaking.]] ^0128

[[H1121|“Son]] [[H120|of man,”]] [[H559|He said]] [[H413|to me,]] [[H5975|“stand up]] [[H5921|on]] [[H7272|your feet]] [[H1696|and I will speak]] [[H853|to you.”]] ^0201

[[H834|And as]] [[H1696|He spoke]] [[H413|to me,]] [[H7307|the Spirit]] [[H935|entered me]] [[H5975|and set]] [[H5921|me on]] [[H7272|my feet,]] [[H8085|and I heard]] ⟨Him⟩ [[H1696|speaking]] [[H413|to me.]] ^0202

[[H1121|“Son]] [[H120|of man,”]] [[H559|He said]] [[H413|to me:]] [[H589|“I]] [[H7971|am sending]] [[H413|you to]] [[H1121|the Israelites,]] [[H413|to]] [[H4775|a rebellious]] [[H1471|nation]] [[H834|that]] [[H4775|has rebelled]] [[H5704|against Me.

[[H859|But you,]] [[H1121|son]] [[H120|of man,]] [[H408|do not]] [[H3372|be afraid]] [[H1992|of them]] [[H1697|or their words.]] [[H408|Do not]] [[H3372|be afraid,]] [[H3588|though]] [[H5621|briers]] [[H5544|and thorns]] [[H854|surround]] [[H859|you,]] [[H3427|and you dwell]] [[H413|among]] [[H6137|scorpions.]] [[H408|Do not]] [[H3372|be afraid]] [[H1697|of their words]] [[H2865|or dismayed]] [[H6440|by their presence,]] [[H3588|though]] [[H4805|they are a rebellious]] [[H1004|house.]] ^0206

[[H1696|But speak]] [[H1697|My words]] [[H413|to them,]] [[H518|whether]] [[H8085|they listen]] [[H518|or]] [[H2308|refuse]] [[H3588|to listen,]] [[H1992|for they]] [[H4805|are rebellious.]] ^0207

[[H859|But you,]] [[H1121|son]] [[H120|of man,]] [[H8085|listen]] [[H834|to what]] [[H589|I]] [[H1696|tell you.]] [[H408|Do not]] [[H1961|be]] [[H4805|rebellious]] [[H4805|like that rebellious]] [[H1004|house.]] [[H6475|Open]] [[H6310|your mouth]] [[H398|and eat]] [[H834|what]] [[H589|I]] [[H5414|give]] [[H413|you.”]] ^0208

[[H7200|Then I looked]] [[H2009|and saw]] [[H3027|a hand]] [[H7971|reaching out]] [[H413|to me,]] [[H2009|and]] [[H4039|in it  was a scroll,]] ^0209

[[H6566|which He unrolled]] [[H6440|before me.]] [[H3789|And written]] [[H6440|on the front]] [[H268|and back]] [[H413|of it]] ⟨were⟩ [[H7015|words of lamentation,]] [[H1899|mourning,]] [[H1958|and woe.]] ^0210

[[H1121|“Son]] [[H120|of man,”]] [[H559|He said]] [[H413|to me,]] [[H398|“eat]] [[H834|what]] [[H4672|you find here.]] [[H398|Eat]] [[H2063|this]] [[H4039|scroll,]] [[H1980|then go]] [[H1696|and speak]] [[H413|to]] [[H1004|the house]] [[H3478|of Israel.”]] ^0301

[[H6605|So I opened]] [[H6310|my mouth,]] [[H398|and He fed]] [[H853|me]] [[H4039|the scroll.]] ^0302

[[H1121|“Son]] [[H120|of man,”]] [[H559|He said]] [[H413|to me,]] [[H398|“eat]] [[H4390|and fill]] [[H4578|your stomach]] [[H2063|with this]] [[H4039|scroll]] [[H589|I]] [[H5414|am giving you.”]] [[H398|So I ate,]] [[H1961|and it was]] [[H4966|as sweet]] [[H1706|as honey]] [[H6310|in my mouth.]] ^0303

[[H559|Then He said]] [[H413|to me,]] [[H1121|“Son]] [[H120|of man,]] [[H1980|go now]] [[H413|to]] [[H1004|the house]] [[H3478|of Israel]] [[H1696|and speak]] [[H1697|My words]] [[H413|to them.]] ^0304

[[H3588|For]] [[H859|you]] [[H3808|are not]] [[H7971|being sent]] [[H413|to]] [[H5971|a people]] [[H6012|of unfamiliar]] [[H8193|speech]] [[H3515|or difficult]] [[H3956|language,]] [[H413|but to]] [[H1004|the house]] [[H3478|of Israel—]] ^0305

[[H1004|But the house]] [[H3478|of Israel]] [[H14|will be unwilling]] [[H8085|to listen]] [[H413|to you,]] [[H3588|since]] [[H14|they are unwilling]] [[H8085|to listen]] [[H413|to Me.]] [[H3588|For]] [[H3605|the whole]] [[H1004|house]] [[H3478|of Israel]] [[H2389|is stubborn]] [[H7186|and obstinate.]] ^0307

[[H1121|“Son]] [[H120|of man,”]] [[H559|He added,]] [[H241|“listen carefully]] [[H3605|to all]] [[H1697|the words]] [[H1696|I speak]] [[H413|to you,]] [[H3947|and take them]] [[H3824|to heart.]] ^0310

[[H7307|Then the Spirit]] [[H5375|lifted me up,]] [[H8085|and I heard]] [[H1419|a great]] [[H7494|rumbling]] [[H6963|sound]] [[H310|behind me—]] [[H1288|blessed be]] [[H3519|the glory]] [[H3068|of the LORD]] [[H4725|in His dwelling place!—]] ^0312

[[H7307|So the Spirit]] [[H5375|lifted me up]] [[H3947|and took me away,]] [[H1980|and I went]] [[H4751|in bitterness]] [[H2534|and in the anger]] [[H7307|of my spirit,]] [[H2388|with the strong]] [[H3027|hand]] [[H3068|of the LORD]] [[H5921|upon me.]] ^0314

[[H8033|And there]] [[H3027|the hand]] [[H3068|of the LORD]] [[H1961|was]] [[H5921|upon me,]] [[H559|and He said]] [[H413|to me,]] [[H6965|“Get up,]] [[H3318|go out]] [[H413|to]] [[H1237|the plain,]] [[H8033|and there]] [[H1696|I will speak]] [[H854|with you.”]] ^0322

[[H6965|So I got up]] [[H3318|and went out]] [[H413|to]] [[H1237|the plain,]] [[H2009|and behold,]] [[H3519|the glory]] [[H3068|of the LORD]] [[H5975|was present]] [[H8033|there,]] [[H3519|like the glory]] [[H7200|I had seen]] [[H5921|by]] [[H5104|the River]] [[H3529|Kebar,]] [[H5307|and I fell]] [[H5921|facedown.]] ^0323

[[H7307|Then the Spirit]] [[H935|entered]] [[H5975|me  and set]] [[H5921|me on]] [[H7272|my feet.]] [[H1696|He spoke]] [[H854|with]] [[H559|me and said:]] [[H935|“Go,]] [[H5462|shut yourself]] [[H8432|inside]] [[H1004|your house.]] ^0324

[[H859|And you,]] [[H1121|son]] [[H120|of man,]] [[H5414|they will tie]] [[H5688|with ropes,]] [[H631|and you will be bound]] [[H3808|so that you cannot]] [[H3318|go out]] [[H8432|among]] ⟨the people⟩. ^0325

[[H3956|I will make your tongue]] [[H1692|stick]] [[H413|to]] [[H2441|the roof of your mouth,]] [[H481|and you will be silent]] [[H3808|and unable]] [[H3198|to rebuke them,]] [[H3588|though]] [[H1992|they]] [[H4805|are a rebellious]] [[H1004|house.]] ^0326

[[H1696|But when I speak]] [[H854|with you,]] [[H6605|I will open]] [[H6310|your mouth,]] [[H559|and you are to tell]] [[H413|them,]] [[H3541|‘This is what]] [[H136|the Lord]] [[H3068|GOD]] [[H559|says.’]] [[H8085|Whoever listens,]] [[H8085|let him listen;]] [[H2308|and whoever refuses,]] [[H2310|let him refuse;]] [[H3588|for]] [[H1992|they]] [[H4805|are a rebellious]] [[H1004|house.]] ^0327

[[H859|Now you,]] [[H1121|son]] [[H120|of man,]] [[H3947|take]] [[H3843|a brick,]] [[H5414|place]] [[H853|it]] [[H6440|before you,]] [[H2710|and draw]] [[H5921|on it]] [[H5892|the city]] [[H3389|of Jerusalem.]] ^0401

[[H5414|Then lay]] [[H4692|siege]] [[H5921|against it:]] [[H1129|Construct]] [[H1785|a siege wall,]] [[H8210|build]] [[H5550|a ramp]] [[H5921|to it,]] [[H5414|set up]] [[H4264|camps]] [[H5921|against it,]] [[H7760|and place]] [[H3733|battering rams]] [[H5921|around it]] [[H5439|on all sides.]] ^0402

[[H859|Then]] [[H3947|take]] [[H1270|an iron]] [[H4227|plate]] [[H5414|and set it up]] [[H1270|as an iron]] [[H7023|wall]] [[H996|between yourself]] [[H5892|and the city.]] [[H3559|Turn]] [[H6440|your face]] [[H413|toward it]] [[H1961|so that it is]] [[H4692|under siege,]] [[H6696|and besiege it.]] [[H1931|This]] [[H226|will be a sign]] [[H1004|to the house]] [[H3478|of Israel.]] ^0403

[[H7901|Then lie down]] [[H5921|on]] [[H8042|your left]] [[H6654|side]] [[H7760|and place]] [[H5771|the iniquity]] [[H1004|of the house]] [[H3478|of Israel]] [[H5921|upon yourself.]] [[H5375|You are to bear]] [[H5771|their iniquity]] [[H4557|for the number]] [[H3117|of days]] [[H7901|you lie on your side.]] ^0404

[[H589|For I]] [[H5414|have assigned]] [[H8141|you the years]] [[H5771|of their iniquity]] [[H4557|according to the number]] [[H3117|of days]] [[H7969|you lie down, 390]] [[H3117|days;]] [[H5375|so you will bear]] [[H5771|the iniquity]] [[H1004|of the house]] [[H3478|of Israel.]] ^0405

[[H3615|When you have completed]] [[H428|these days,]] [[H7901|lie down]] [[H8145|again,]] [[H5921|but on]] [[H3227|your right]] [[H6654|side,]] [[H5375|and bear]] [[H5771|the iniquity]] [[H1004|of the house]] [[H3063|of Judah.]] [[H5414|I have assigned]] [[H705|to you  40]] [[H3117|days,]] [[H3117|a day]] [[H8141|for each year.]] ^0406

[[H3559|You must turn]] [[H6440|your face]] [[H413|toward]] [[H4692|the siege]] [[H3389|of Jerusalem]] [[H2220|with your arm]] [[H2834|bared,]] [[H5012|and prophesy]] [[H5921|against it.]] ^0407

[[H2009|Now behold,]] [[H5414|I will tie you up]] [[H5688|with ropes]] [[H3808|so you cannot]] [[H2015|turn]] [[H6654|from side]] [[H413|to]] [[H6654|side]] [[H5704|until]] [[H3615|you have finished]] [[H3117|the days]] [[H4692|of your siege.]] ^0408

[[H3947|But take]] [[H2406|wheat,]] [[H8184|barley,]] [[H6321|beans,]] [[H5742|lentils,]] [[H1764|millet,]] [[H3698|and spelt;]] [[H5414|put]] [[H259|them in a single]] [[H3627|container]] [[H6213|and make]] [[H3899|them into bread]] [[H398|for yourself. you are to eat]] ⟨This is what⟩ [[H4557|during the]] [[H7969|390]] [[H3117|days]] [[H834|that]] [[H7901|you lie]] [[H5921|on]] [[H6654|your side.]] ^0409

[[H4946|You are to weigh out]] [[H6242|twenty]] [[H8255|shekels]] [[H3978|of food]] [[H398|to eat]] [[H3117|each day,]] [[H398|and you are to eat it]] [[H6256|at set times.]] ^0410

[[H4884|You are also to measure out]] [[H8345|a sixth]] [[H1969|of a hin]] [[H4325|of water]] [[H8354|to drink,]] [[H8354|and you are to drink it]] [[H6256|at set times.]] ^0411

[[H398|And you shall eat]] ⟨the food⟩ [[H1931|]] [[H8184|as you would a barley]] [[H5692|cake,]] [[H5746|after you bake]] [[H120|it over dried human]] [[H1561|excrement]] [[H5869|in the sight.”]] ⟨of the people⟩ ^0412

[[H3068|Then the LORD]] [[H559|said,]] [[H3602|“This is how]] [[H1121|the Israelites]] [[H398|will eat]] [[H2931|their defiled]] [[H3899|bread]] [[H1471|among the nations]] [[H834|to which]] [[H5080|I will banish them.”]] ^0413

[[H162|“Ah,]] [[H136|Lord]] [[H3069|GOD,”]] [[H559|I said,]] [[H5315|“I]] [[H3808|have never]] [[H2930|defiled myself.]] [[H5271|From my youth]] [[H5704|until]] [[H6258|now]] [[H3808|I have not]] [[H398|eaten]] [[H5038|anything found dead]] [[H2966|or mauled by wild beasts.]] [[H3808|No]] [[H6292|unclean]] [[H1320|meat]] [[H935|has ever entered]] [[H6310|my mouth.”]] ^0414

[[H7200|“Look,”]] [[H559|He replied,]] [[H5414|“I will let]] [[H1241|you use cow]] [[H6832|dung]] [[H8478|instead of]] [[H120|human]] [[H1561|excrement,]] [[H6213|and you may bake]] [[H3899|your bread]] [[H5921|over that.”]] ^0415

[[H559|Then He told]] [[H413|me,]] [[H1121|“Son]] [[H120|of man,]] [[H7665|I am going to cut off]] [[H4294|the supply]] [[H3899|of food]] [[H3389|in Jerusalem.]] [[H1674|They will anxiously]] [[H398|eat]] [[H3899|bread]] [[H4948|rationed by weight,]] [[H8078|and in despair]] [[H8354|they will drink]] [[H4325|water]] [[H4884|by measure.]] ^0416

[[H4616|So]] [[H2637|they will lack]] [[H3899|food]] [[H4325|and water;]] [[H8074|they will be appalled]] ⟨over the sight of⟩ [[H376|one]] [[H251|another]] [[H4743|wasting away]] [[H5771|in their iniquity.]] ^0417

[[H859|Now you,]] [[H1121|son]] [[H120|of man,]] [[H3947|take]] [[H2299|a sharp]] [[H2719|sword,]] [[H3947|use]] [[H1532|it as a barber’s]] [[H8593|razor,]] [[H5674|and shave]] [[H7218|your head]] [[H2206|and beard.]] [[H3947|Then take]] [[H3976|a set of scales]] [[H2505|and divide the hair.]] ^0501

[[H3117|When the days]] [[H4692|of the siege]] [[H4390|have ended,]] [[H1197|you are to burn up]] [[H7992|a third]] ⟨of the hair⟩ [[H8432|inside]] [[H5892|the city;]] [[H3947|you are also to take]] [[H7992|a third]] [[H5221|and slash]] [[H2719|it with the sword]] [[H5439|all around the city;]] [[H2219|and you are to scatter]] [[H7992|a third]] [[H7307|to the wind.]] [[H7324|For I will unleash]] [[H2719|a sword]] [[H310|behind them.]] ^0502

[[H3947|But you are to take]] [[H4592|a few]] [[H4557|strands of hair]] [[H6696|and secure]] [[H853|them]] [[H3671|in the folds of your garment.]] ^0503

[[H5750|Again,]] [[H3947|take]] [[H1992|a few of these,]] [[H7993|throw]] [[H413|them into]] [[H784|the fire,]] [[H8313|and burn]] [[H853|them.]] [[H4480|From there]] [[H784|a fire]] [[H3318|will spread]] [[H413|to]] [[H3605|the whole]] [[H1004|house]] [[H3478|of Israel.]] ^0504

[[H3541|This is what]] [[H136|the Lord]] [[H3069|GOD]] [[H559|says:]] [[H2063|‘This]] ⟨is⟩ [[H3389|Jerusalem,]] [[H7760|which I have set]] [[H8432|in the center]] [[H1471|of the nations,]] [[H776|with countries]] [[H5439|all around her.]] ^0505

[[H4784|But she has rebelled]] [[H4941|against My ordinances]] [[H7564|more wickedly]] [[H4480|than]] [[H1471|the nations,]] [[H853|and]] [[H2708|against My statutes]] [[H4480|worse than]] [[H776|the countries]] [[H5439|around her.]] [[H3588|For]] [[H3988|her people have rejected]] [[H4941|My ordinances]] [[H3808|and have not]] [[H1980|walked]] [[H2708|in  My statutes.’]] ^0506

[[H3651|Therefore,]] [[H3541|this is what]] [[H136|the Lord]] [[H3068|GOD]] [[H559|says:]] [[H1995|‘You have been more insubordinate]] [[H4480|than]] [[H1471|the nations]] [[H5439|around you;]] [[H3808|you have not]] [[H1980|walked]] [[H2708|in My statutes]] [[H6213|or kept]] [[H4941|My ordinances;]] [[H3808|nor]] [[H6213|have you even conformed]] [[H4941|to the ordinances]] [[H1471|of the nations]] [[H5439|around you.’]] ^0507

[[H3651|Therefore,]] [[H3541|this is what]] [[H136|the Lord]] [[H3069|GOD]] [[H559|says:]] [[H2005|‘Behold,]] [[H589|I Myself am]] [[H5921|against you,]] ⟨Jerusalem⟩, [[H6213|and I will execute]] [[H4941|judgments]] [[H8432|among you]] [[H5869|in the sight]] [[H1471|of the nations.]] ^0508

[[H3282|Because of]] [[H3605|all]] [[H8441|your abominations,]] [[H6213|I will do]] [[H834|to you what]] [[H3808|I have never]] [[H6213|done before]] [[H834|and]] [[H3808|will never]] [[H6213|do]] [[H5750|again.]] ^0509

[[H3651|As a result,]] [[H1|fathers]] [[H8432|among you]] [[H398|will eat]] [[H1121|their sons,]] [[H1121|and sons]] [[H398|will eat]] [[H1|their fathers.]] [[H6213|I will execute]] [[H8201|judgments]] [[H2219|against you and scatter]] [[H3605|all]] [[H7611|your remnant]] [[H3605|to every]] [[H7307|wind.’]] ^0510

[[H7992|A third]] [[H4191|of your people will die]] [[H1698|by plague]] [[H3615|or be consumed]] [[H7458|by famine]] [[H8432|within you,]] [[H7992|a third]] [[H5307|will fall]] [[H2719|by the sword]] [[H5439|outside]] ⟨your walls⟩, [[H7992|and a third]] [[H2219|I will scatter]] [[H3605|to every]] [[H7307|wind]] [[H7324|and unleash]] [[H2719|a sword]] [[H310|behind them.]] ^0512

[[H639|And when My anger]] [[H3615|is spent]] [[H5117|and I have vented]] [[H2534|My wrath]] [[H5162|against them,  I will be appeased.]] [[H3615|And when I have spent]] [[H2534|My wrath]] [[H3045|on them,  they will know]] [[H3588|that]] [[H589|I,]] [[H3068|the LORD,]] [[H7068|in My zeal]] [[H1696|have spoken.]] ^0513

[[H5414|I will make]] [[H2723|you a ruin]] [[H2781|and a disgrace]] [[H1471|among the nations]] [[H5439|around you,]] [[H5869|in the sight]] [[H3605|of all]] [[H5674|who pass by.]] ^0514

[[H1961|So you will be]] [[H2781|a reproach]] [[H1422|and a taunt,]] [[H4148|a warning]] [[H4923|and a horror]] [[H1471|to the nations]] [[H5439|around you,]] [[H6213|when I execute]] [[H8201|judgments against you]] [[H639|in anger,]] [[H2534|wrath,]] [[H2534|and raging]] [[H8433|fury.]] [[H589|I,]] [[H3068|the LORD,]] [[H1696|have spoken.]] ^0515

[[H7971|I will send]] [[H7458|famine]] [[H7451|and wild]] [[H2416|beasts]] [[H5921|against you,]] [[H7921|and they will leave you childless.]] [[H1698|Plague]] [[H1818|and bloodshed]] [[H5674|will sweep through you,]] [[H935|and I will bring]] [[H2719|a sword]] [[H5921|against you.]] [[H589|I,]] [[H3068|the LORD,]] [[H1696|have spoken.”]] ^0517

[[H5414|I will lay]] [[H6297|the corpses]] [[H1121|of the Israelites]] [[H6440|before]] [[H1544|their idols]] [[H2219|and scatter]] [[H6106|your bones]] [[H5439|around]] [[H4196|your altars.]] ^0605

[[H241|And as I listened,]] [[H559|He said]] [[H428|to the others,]] [[H5674|“Follow him]] [[H5892|through the city]] [[H5221|and start killing;]] [[H408|do not]] [[H5869|show pity]] [[H2550|or spare anyone!]] ^0905

[[H2026|Slaughter]] [[H2205|the old men,]] [[H970|the young men]] [[H1330|and maidens,]] [[H802|the women]] [[H2945|and children,]] [[H408|but do not]] [[H5066|go near]] [[H3605|anyone]] [[H834|who]] [[H8420|has the mark.]] [[H2490|Now begin]] [[H4720|at My sanctuary.”]] [[H2490|So they began]] [[H2205|with the elders]] [[H834|who]] ⟨were⟩ [[H6440|before]] [[H1004|the temple.]] ^0906

[[H559|Then He told]] [[H413|them,]] [[H2930|“Defile]] [[H1004|the temple]] [[H4390|and fill]] [[H2691|the courts]] [[H2491|with the slain.]] [[H3318|Go forth!”]] [[H3318|So they went out]] [[H5221|and began killing]] [[H5892|throughout the city.]] ^0907

[[H5221|While they were killing,]] [[H589|I]] [[H7604|was left alone.]] [[H5307|And I fell]] [[H5921|facedown]] [[H2199|and cried out,]] [[H162|“Oh,]] [[H136|Lord]] [[H3069|GOD,]] [[H8210|when You pour out]] [[H2534|Your wrath]] [[H5921|on]] [[H3389|Jerusalem,]] [[H859|will You]] [[H7843|destroy]] [[H3605|the entire]] [[H7611|remnant]] [[H3478|of Israel?”]] ^0908

[[H559|And He said]] [[H413|to me,]] [[H5771|“The iniquity]] [[H1004|of the house]] [[H3478|of Israel]] [[H3063|and Judah]] ⟨is⟩ [[H3966|exceedingly]] [[H1419|great.]] [[H776|The land]] [[H4390|is full of]] [[H1818|bloodshed,]] [[H5892|and the city]] [[H4390|full of]] [[H4297|perversity.]] [[H3588|For]] [[H559|they say,]] [[H3068|‘The LORD]] [[H5800|has forsaken]] [[H776|the land;]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H369|does not]] [[H7200|see.]] ^0909

[[H2009|Then]] [[H376|the man]] [[H3830|clothed]] [[H906|in linen]] [[H7083|with the writing kit]] [[H4975|at his side]] [[H7725|reported back,]] [[H6213|“I have done]] [[H834|as]] [[H6680|You  commanded.”]] ^0911

[[H7200|And I looked]] [[H2009|and saw]] [[H413|above]] [[H7549|the expanse,]] [[H5921|above]] [[H7218|the heads]] [[H3742|of the cherubim,]] [[H1823|the likeness]] [[H3678|of a throne]] [[H5601|of sapphire.]] ^1001

[[H559|And the LORD said]] [[H413|to]] [[H376|the man]] [[H3847|clothed]] [[H906|in linen,]] [[H935|“Go]] [[H413|inside]] [[H1534|the wheelwork]] [[H8478|beneath]] [[H3742|the cherubim.]] [[H4390|Fill]] [[H2651|your hands]] [[H1513|with burning coals]] [[H996|from among]] [[H3742|the cherubim]] [[H2236|and scatter]] [[H5921|them over]] [[H5892|the city.”]] [[H5869|And as I watched,]] [[H935|he went in.]] ^1002

[[H376|Now when the man]] [[H935|went in,]] [[H3742|the cherubim]] [[H5975|were standing]] [[H3225|on the south side]] [[H1004|of the temple,]] [[H6051|and a cloud]] [[H4390|filled]] [[H6442|the inner]] [[H2691|court.]] ^1003

[[H3519|Then the glory]] [[H3069|of the LORD]] [[H7311|rose]] [[H5921|from above]] [[H3742|the cherubim]] ⟨and stood⟩ [[H5921|over]] [[H4670|the threshold]] [[H1004|of the temple.]] [[H1004|The temple]] [[H4390|was filled]] [[H6051|with the cloud,]] [[H2691|and the court]] [[H4390|was filled]] [[H5051|with the brightness]] [[H3519|of the glory]] [[H3069|of the LORD.]] ^1004

[[H6963|The sound]] [[H3671|of the wings]] [[H3742|of the cherubim]] [[H8085|could be heard]] [[H5704|as]] [[H2435|far as the outer]] [[H2691|court,]] [[H6963|like the voice]] [[H410|of God]] [[H7706|Almighty]] [[H1696|when He speaks.]] ^1005

[[H1961|When]] [[H6680|the LORD commanded]] [[H376|the man]] [[H3847|clothed]] [[H906|in linen,]] [[H559|saying,]] [[H3947|“Take]] [[H784|fire]] [[H996|from within]] [[H1534|the wheelwork,]] [[H996|from among]] [[H3742|the cherubim,”]] [[H935|the man went in]] [[H5975|and stood]] [[H681|beside]] [[H212|a wheel.]] ^1006

[[H3742|Then one of the cherubim]] [[H7971|reached out]] [[H3027|his hand]] [[H5375|and took]] ⟨some of⟩ [[H784|the fire]] [[H834|that]] [[H996|was among them,]] [[H5414|and he put]] [[H413|it into]] [[H2651|the hands]] [[H3847|of the man clothed]] [[H906|in linen,]] [[H3947|who received it]] [[H3318|and left.]] ^1007

[[H3742|(The cherubim]] [[H7200|appeared]] [[H8403|to have the form]] [[H120|of human]] [[H3027|hands]] [[H8478|under]] [[H3671|their wings.)]] ^1008

[[H7200|Then I looked]] [[H2009|and saw]] [[H702|four]] [[H212|wheels]] [[H681|beside]] [[H3742|the cherubim,]] [[H259|one]] [[H212|wheel]] [[H681|beside]] [[H259|each]] [[H3742|cherub.]] ⟨And⟩ [[H4758|]] [[H212|the wheels]] [[H5869|gleamed]] [[H8658|like a beryl]] [[H68|stone.]] ^1009

⟨As for⟩ [[H4758|their appearance,]] [[H702|all four]] [[H259|had the same]] [[H1823|form,]] [[H834|like]] [[H212|a wheel]] [[H8432|within]] [[H212|a wheel.]] ^1010

[[H1980|When they moved,]] [[H1980|they would go]] [[H413|in]] [[H702|any of the four]] [[H7253|directions,]] [[H3808|without]] [[H5437|turning]] [[H1980|as they moved.]] [[H3588|But]] [[H4725|wherever]] [[H7218|the head]] [[H6437|faced,]] [[H1980|they would go]] [[H310|in that direction,]] [[H3808|without]] [[H5437|turning]] [[H1980|as they went.]] ^1011

[[H3605|Their entire]] [[H1320|bodies,]] [[H1354|including their backs,]] [[H3027|hands,]] [[H3671|and wings,]] [[H4392|were full of]] [[H5869|eyes]] [[H5439|all around,]] [[H702|as were their four]] [[H212|wheels.]] ^1012

[[H241|I heard]] [[H212|the wheels]] [[H7121|being called]] [[H1534|“the whirling wheels.”]] ^1013

[[H259|Each]] ⟨of the cherubim⟩ [[H702|had four]] [[H6440|faces:]] [[H259|the first]] [[H6440|face]] [[H6440|was that]] [[H3742|of a cherub,]] [[H8145|the second]] [[H6440|that]] [[H120|of a man,]] [[H7992|the third]] [[H6440|that]] [[H738|of a lion,]] [[H7243|and the fourth]] [[H6440|that]] [[H5404|of an eagle.]] ^1014

[[H3742|Then the cherubim]] [[H7426|rose upward.]] [[H1931|These]] [[H2416|were the living creatures]] [[H7200|I had seen]] [[H5104|by the River]] [[H3529|Kebar.]] ^1015

[[H3742|When the cherubim]] [[H1980|moved,]] [[H212|the wheels]] [[H1980|moved]] [[H681|beside them,]] ⟨and even when they⟩ [[H3742|]] [[H5375|spread]] [[H3671|their wings]] [[H7311|to rise]] [[H5921|from]] [[H776|the ground,]] [[H212|the wheels]] [[H3808|did not]] [[H5437|veer away]] [[H681|from their side.]] ^1016

[[H5975|When the cherubim stood still,]] [[H5975|the wheels also stood still,]] [[H7311|and when they ascended,]] [[H7426|the wheels ascended]] [[H853|with them,]] [[H3588|for]] [[H7307|the spirit]] [[H2416|of the living creatures]] ^1017

[[H3519|Then the glory]] [[H3068|of the LORD]] [[H3318|moved away]] [[H5921|from over]] [[H4670|the threshold]] [[H1004|of the temple]] [[H5975|and stood]] [[H5921|above]] [[H3742|the cherubim.]] ^1018

[[H5869|As I watched,]] [[H3742|the cherubim]] [[H5375|lifted]] [[H3671|their wings]] [[H7426|and rose up]] [[H4480|from]] [[H776|the ground,]] [[H212|with the wheels]] [[H5980|beside]] [[H3318|them as they went.]] [[H5975|And they stopped]] [[H6607|at the entrance]] [[H6931|of the east]] [[H8179|gate]] [[H1004|of the house]] [[H3068|of the LORD,]] [[H3519|with the glory]] [[H430|of the God]] [[H3478|of Israel]] [[H5921|above]] [[H4605|them.]] ^1019

[[H1931|These]] [[H2416|were the living creatures]] [[H7200|I had seen]] [[H8478|beneath]] [[H430|the God]] [[H3478|of Israel]] [[H5104|by the River]] [[H3529|Kebar,]] [[H3045|and I knew]] [[H3588|that]] [[H1992|they]] [[H3742|were cherubim.]] ^1020

[[H259|Each]] [[H702|had four]] [[H6440|faces]] [[H259|and]] [[H702|four]] [[H3671|wings,]] [[H1823|with what looked like]] [[H120|human]] [[H3027|hands]] [[H8478|under]] [[H3671|their wings.]] ^1021

[[H6440|Their faces]] [[H1823|looked like]] [[H6440|the faces]] [[H7200|I had seen]] [[H5921|by]] [[H5104|the River]] [[H3529|Kebar.]] [[H376|Each]] [[H1980|creature went]] [[H413|straight ahead.]] ^1022

[[H7307|Then the Spirit]] [[H5375|lifted me up]] [[H935|and brought]] [[H413|me to]] [[H8179|the gate]] [[H1004|of the house]] [[H3068|of the LORD]] [[H6437|that faces]] [[H6921|east.]] [[H2009|And there]] [[H6607|at the entrance]] [[H8179|of the gate]] ⟨were⟩ [[H6242|twenty-five]] [[H376|men.]] [[H8432|Among]] [[H7200|them I saw]] [[H2970|Jaazaniah]] [[H1121|son]] [[H5809|of Azzur]] [[H6410|and Pelatiah]] [[H1121|son]] [[H1141|of Benaiah,]] [[H8269|who were leaders]] [[H5971|of the people.]] ^1101

[[H559|And said]] ⟨the LORD⟩ [[H413|to me,]] [[H1121|“Son]] [[H120|of man,]] [[H428|these]] [[H376|are the men]] [[H2803|who plot]] [[H205|evil]] [[H3289|and give]] [[H7451|wicked]] [[H6098|counsel]] [[H2063|in this]] [[H5892|city.]] ^1102

[[H559|They are saying,]] [[H3808|‘Is not]] [[H7138|the time near]] [[H1129|to build]] [[H1004|houses?]] [[H1931|The city]] [[H5518|is a cooking pot,]] [[H587|and we]] [[H1320|are the meat.’]] ^1103

[[H8457|So your prostitution]] [[H1961|is]] [[H2016|the opposite]] [[H4480|of that]] [[H802|of other women:]] [[H3808|No one]] [[H310|solicited]] [[H2181|your favors,]] [[H5414|and you paid]] [[H868|a fee]] [[H3808|instead of]] [[H5414|receiving]] [[H868|one;]] [[H1961|so you  are]] [[H2016|the very opposite.’]] ^1634

[[H5927|They will bring]] [[H6951|a mob]] [[H5921|against]] [[H7275|you to stone]] [[H853|you]] [[H1333|and cut you to pieces]] [[H2719|with their swords.]] ^1640

[[H8313|Then they will burn down]] [[H1004|your houses]] [[H6213|and execute]] [[H8201|judgment]] [[H5869|against you  in the sight]] [[H7227|of many]] [[H802|women.]] [[H7673|I will put an end]] [[H2181|to your prostitution,]] [[H3808|and you will never]] [[H1571|again]] [[H5414|pay]] [[H868|your lovers.]] ^1641

[[H2009|Now]] [[H2088|this]] [[H1961|was]] [[H5771|the iniquity]] [[H269|of your sister]] [[H5467|Sodom:]] [[H1323|She and her daughters]] [[H1961|were]] [[H1347|arrogant,]] [[H7653|overfed,]] [[H8252|and complacent;]] [[H3808|they did not]] [[H2388|help]] [[H6041|the poor]] [[H34|and needy.]] ^1649

[[H1361|Thus they were haughty]] [[H6213|and committed]] [[H8441|abominations]] [[H6440|before Me,]] [[H834|and when]] [[H7200|I saw this,]] [[H5493|I removed]] [[H853|them.]] ^1650

[[H589|But I]] [[H2142|will remember]] [[H1285|the covenant]] [[H854|I made with you]] [[H3117|in the days]] [[H5271|of your youth,]] [[H6965|and I will establish]] [[H5769|an everlasting covenant with you.]] ^1660

[[H2142|Then you will remember]] [[H1870|your ways]] [[H3637|and be ashamed]] [[H3947|when you receive]] [[H1419|your older]] [[H413|and]] [[H6996|younger]] [[H269|sisters.]] [[H5414|I will give]] [[H853|them]] [[H1323|to you  as daughters,]] [[H3808|but not]] [[H4480|because of]] [[H1285|My covenant with you.]] ^1661

[[H589|So I]] [[H6965|will establish]] [[H1285|My covenant]] [[H854|with you,]] [[H3045|and you will know]] [[H3588|that]] [[H589|I]] [[H3068|am the LORD,]] ^1662

[[H1004|Yet the house]] [[H3478|of Israel]] [[H4784|rebelled]] [[H4057|against Me  in the wilderness.]] [[H3808|They did not]] [[H1980|follow]] [[H2708|My statutes]] [[H3988|and they rejected]] [[H4941|My ordinances—]] [[H120|though the man]] [[H834|who]] [[H6213|does]] ⟨these things⟩ [[H2425|will live]] [[H853|by them—  and they]] [[H3966|utterly]] [[H2490|profaned]] [[H7676|My Sabbaths.]] [[H559|Then I resolved]] [[H8210|to pour]] [[H2534|out My wrath]] [[H5921|upon them]] [[H3615|and put an end to them]] [[H4057|in the wilderness.]] ^2013

[[H3282|because]] [[H3988|they kept rejecting]] [[H4941|My ordinances,]] [[H2490|profaning]] [[H7676|My Sabbaths,]] [[H3808|and refusing]] [[H1980|to walk]] [[H2708|in My statutes.]] [[H3588|For]] [[H3820|their hearts]] [[H1980|continually went]] [[H310|after]] [[H1544|their idols.]] ^2016

[[H2347|Yet I looked on them with pity]] [[H7843|and did not destroy them]] [[H3808|or]] [[H6213|bring]] [[H853|them]] [[H3617|to an end]] [[H4057|in the wilderness.]] ^2017

[[H4057|In the wilderness]] [[H559|I said]] [[H413|to]] [[H1121|their children:]] [[H408|“Do not]] [[H1980|walk]] [[H2706|in the statutes]] [[H1|of your fathers]] [[H8104|or keep]] [[H4941|their ordinances]] [[H2930|or defile]] [[H1544|yourselves with their idols.]] ^2018

[[H589|I]] [[H3068|am the LORD]] [[H430|your God;]] [[H1980|walk]] [[H2708|in My statutes,]] [[H8104|keep]] [[H4941|My ordinances,]] [[H6213|and practice them.]] ^2019

[[H1121|But the children]] [[H4784|rebelled]] [[H3808|against Me.

[[H7725|But I withheld]] [[H3027|My hand]] [[H6213|and acted]] [[H4616|for the sake]] [[H8034|of My name,]] [[H1115|so that it would not]] [[H2490|be profaned]] [[H5869|in the eyes]] [[H1471|of the nations]] [[H834|in whose]] [[H5869|sight]] [[H3318|I had brought them out.]] ^2022

[[H1571|However,]] [[H5375|with an uplifted hand I swore]] [[H4057|to them  in the wilderness]] [[H6327|that I would scatter]] [[H853|them]] [[H1471|among the nations]] [[H2219|and disperse]] [[H853|them]] [[H776|throughout the lands.]] ^2023

[[H589|I]] [[H1571|also]] [[H5414|gave]] [[H2706|them over  to statutes]] [[H3808|that were not]] [[H2896|good]] [[H4941|and ordinances]] [[H3808|by which  they could not]] [[H2421|live.]] ^2025

[[H2930|And I pronounced them unclean]] [[H4979|through their gifts—]] [[H5674|the sacrifice]] [[H3605|of every]] [[H6363|firstborn —]] ⟨in the fire⟩ [[H4616|so that]] [[H8074|I might devastate them,]] [[H834|in order that]] [[H3045|they would know]] [[H834|that]] [[H589|I]] [[H3068|am the LORD.’]] ^2026

[[H3651|Therefore,]] [[H1121|son]] [[H120|of man,]] [[H1696|speak]] [[H413|to]] [[H1004|the house]] [[H3478|of Israel,]] [[H559|and tell them that]] [[H3541|this is what]] [[H136|the Lord]] [[H3069|GOD]] [[H559|says:]] [[H2063|‘In this way]] [[H5750|also]] [[H1|your fathers]] [[H1442|blasphemed]] [[H853|Me]] [[H4603|by their unfaithfulness]] [[H4604|against Me.]] ^2027

[[H1540|When openly]] ⟨Oholibah⟩ [[H8457|prostituted herself]] [[H1540|and exposed]] [[H6172|her nakedness,]] [[H5315|I]] [[H5921|turned away from her]] [[H3363|in disgust,]] [[H834|just as]] [[H5315|I]] [[H5361|had turned away]] [[H5921|from]] [[H269|her sister.]] ^2318

[[H7235|Yet she multiplied]] [[H8457|her promiscuity,]] [[H2142|remembering]] [[H3117|the days]] [[H5271|of her youth,]] [[H834|when]] [[H2181|she had prostituted herself]] [[H776|in the land]] [[H4714|of Egypt]] ^2319

[[H5689|and lusted]] [[H5921|after]] [[H6370|their lovers,]] [[H834|whose]] [[H1320|genitals]] [[H1320|were like those]] [[H2543|of donkeys]] [[H2231|and whose emission]] [[H2231|was like that]] [[H5483|of stallions.]] ^2320

[[H6485|So you revisited]] [[H2154|the indecency]] [[H5271|of your youth,]] [[H4714|when the Egyptians]] [[H6213|caressed]] [[H1717|your bosom]] [[H4616|and pressed]] [[H5271|your young]] [[H7699|breasts.]] ^2321

[[H3651|Therefore,]] [[H172|Oholibah,]] [[H3541|this is what]] [[H136|the Lord]] [[H3069|GOD]] [[H559|says:]] [[H5782|‘I will incite]] [[H157|your lovers]] [[H5921|against you,]] [[H834|those]] [[H5315|from whom]] [[H5361|you turned in disgust.]] [[H935|And I will bring them]] [[H5921|against you]] [[H5439|from every side—]] ^2322

[[H1121|the Babylonians]] [[H3605|and all]] [[H3778|the Chaldeans,]] ⟨the men of⟩ [[H6489|Pekod,]] [[H7772|Shoa,]] [[H6970|and Koa,]] [[H3605|and all]] [[H1121|the Assyrians]] [[H854|with them—]] [[H2531|all desirable]] [[H970|young men,]] [[H6346|governors]] [[H5461|and commanders,]] [[H7991|officers]] [[H3605|and administrators,]] [[H7392|mounted on]] [[H5483|horses.]] ^2323

[[H935|They will come]] [[H5921|against you]] [[H6951|with a host]] [[H5971|of peoples,]] [[H2021|with weapons,]] [[H7393|chariots,]] [[H1534|and wagons.]] [[H7760|They will array themselves]] [[H5921|against you]] [[H5439|on every side]] [[H6793|with buckler]] [[H4043|and shield]] [[H6959|and helmet.]] [[H5414|I will delegate]] [[H4941|judgment]] [[H6440|to them,]] [[H8199|and they will punish you]] [[H4941|by their own standards.]] ^2324

[[H5414|And I will set]] [[H7068|My jealous rage]] [[H6213|against you,  and they will deal]] [[H854|with you]] [[H2534|in fury.]] [[H5493|They will cut off]] [[H639|your noses]] [[H241|and ears,]] [[H319|and your survivors]] [[H5307|will fall]] [[H2719|by the sword.]] [[H1992|They]] [[H3947|will seize]] [[H1121|your sons]] [[H1323|and daughters,]] [[H319|and your remnant]] [[H398|will be consumed]] [[H784|by fire.]] ^2325

[[H7673|So I will put an end]] [[H4480|to]] [[H2154|your indecency]] [[H2184|and prostitution,]] [[H776|which began in the land]] [[H4714|of Egypt,]] [[H3808|and you will not]] [[H5375|lift]] [[H5869|your eyes]] [[H413|to them]] [[H2142|or remember]] [[H4714|Egypt]] [[H5750|anymore.’]] ^2327

[[H3588|For]] [[H3541|this is what]] [[H136|the Lord]] [[H3068|GOD]] [[H559|says:]] [[H2005|‘Surely]] [[H5414|I will deliver you]] [[H3027|into the hands of those]] [[H8130|you hate,]] [[H834|from whom]] [[H5315|you turned away]] [[H5361|in disgust.]] ^2328

[[H6213|They will treat]] [[H8135|you with hatred,]] [[H3947|take]] [[H3605|all for which]] [[H3018|you have worked,]] [[H5800|and leave you]] [[H5903|naked]] [[H6181|and bare,]] [[H6172|so that the shame]] [[H2183|of your prostitution]] [[H1540|will be exposed.]] [[H2154|Your indecency]] [[H8457|and promiscuity]] ^2329

[[H6213|have brought]] [[H428|these things]] [[H2181|upon you,  because you have prostituted yourself]] [[H310|with]] [[H1471|the nations]] [[H2930|and defiled yourself]] [[H1544|with their idols.]] ^2330

[[H1980|Because you have followed]] [[H1870|the path]] [[H269|of your sister,]] [[H5414|I will put]] [[H3563|her cup]] [[H3027|into your hand.’]] ^2331

[[H3541|This is what]] [[H136|the Lord]] [[H3069|GOD]] [[H559|says:]] [[H8354|‘You will drink]] [[H269|your sister’s]] [[H3563|cup,]] [[H6013|a cup deep]] [[H7342|and wide.]] [[H1961|It will bring]] [[H6712|scorn]] [[H3932|and derision,]] [[H3557|for it holds]] [[H4767|so much.]] ^2332

[[H4390|You will be filled]] [[H7943|with drunkenness]] [[H3015|and grief,]] [[H3563|with a cup]] [[H8047|of devastation]] [[H8077|and desolation,]] [[H3563|the cup]] [[H269|of your sister]] [[H8111|Samaria.]] ^2333

[[H8354|You will drink]] [[H4680|it dry;]] [[H1633|you will dash it]] [[H2789|to pieces,]] [[H5423|and tear]] [[H7699|your breasts.]] [[H3588|For]] [[H589|I]] [[H1696|have spoken,’]] [[H5002|declares]] [[H136|the Lord]] [[H3069|GOD.]] ^2334

[[H3651|Therefore,]] [[H3541|this is what]] [[H136|the Lord]] [[H3069|GOD]] [[H559|says:]] [[H3282|‘Because]] [[H7911|you have forgotten]] [[H853|Me]] [[H7993|and have cast]] [[H853|Me]] [[H310|behind]] [[H1458|your back,]] [[H859|you]] [[H5375|must bear the consequences]] ⟨of⟩ [[H2154|your indecency]] [[H853|and]] [[H8457|prostitution.’”]] ^2335

[[H3068|Then the LORD]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to me:]] [[H1121|“Son]] [[H120|of man,]] [[H8199|will you pass judgment]] [[H170|against Oholah]] [[H172|and Oholibah?]] [[H5046|Then declare]] [[H8441|to them  their abominations.]] ^2336

[[H3588|For]] [[H5003|they have committed adultery,]] [[H1818|and blood]] [[H3027|is on their hands;]] [[H5003|they have committed adultery]] [[H1544|with their idols.]] [[H1571|They have even]] [[H1121|sacrificed their children,]] [[H834|whom]] [[H3205|they bore]] [[H5674|to Me,  in the fire]] [[H402|as food]] ^2337

[[H5750|They have also]] [[H6213|done]] [[H2063|to Me  this:]] [[H1931|On that very same]] [[H3117|day]] [[H2930|they defiled]] [[H4720|My sanctuary]] [[H2490|and profaned]] [[H7676|My Sabbaths.]] ^2338

[[H1931|On the very]] [[H3117|day]] [[H7819|they slaughtered]] [[H1121|their children]] [[H1544|for their idols,]] [[H935|they entered]] [[H4720|My sanctuary]] [[H2490|to profane it.]] [[H2009|Yes,]] [[H3541|this]] [[H6213|they did]] [[H8432|inside]] [[H1004|My house.]] ^2339

[[H637|Furthermore,]] [[H7971|they sent]] [[H4397|messengers]] [[H376|for men]] [[H935|who came]] [[H4801|from afar;]] [[H2009|and behold,]] [[H935|when they arrived,]] [[H7364|you bathed]] [[H834|for them,]] [[H3583|painted]] [[H5869|your eyes,]] [[H5710|and adorned yourself]] [[H5716|with jewelry.]] ^2340

[[H3427|You sat]] [[H5921|on]] [[H4296|a couch]] [[H3520|of luxury]] [[H7979|with a table]] [[H6186|spread]] [[H6440|before it,]] [[H5921|on]] [[H7760|which you had set]] [[H7004|My incense]] [[H8081|and My oil.]] ^2341

[[H6963|The sound]] [[H7961|of a carefree]] [[H1995|crowd]] [[H5433|accompanied her.  Sabeans]] [[H935|were brought in]] [[H4057|from the desert]] [[H413|along with]] [[H376|men]] [[H7230|from the rabble,]] [[H5414|who put]] [[H6781|bracelets]] [[H413|on]] [[H3027|your wrists]] [[H8597|and beautiful]] [[H5850|crowns]] [[H5921|on]] [[H7218|your head.]] ^2342

[[H559|Then I said]] [[H1087|of old]] ⟨her⟩ ⟨who⟩ ⟨had⟩ ⟨grown⟩ [[H5004|in adulteries:]] [[H2181|‘Now  let them use her as a prostitute,]] [[H1931|for that is all she is!’]] ^2343

[[H6662|But righteous]] [[H376|men]] [[H8199|will sentence]] [[H853|them]] [[H4941|to the punishment of]] [[H5003|those who commit adultery]] [[H8210|and bloodshed,]] [[H3588|because]] [[H2007|they]] [[H5003|are adulteresses]] [[H1818|with blood]] [[H3027|on their hands.]] ^2345

[[H3541|This is what]] [[H136|the Lord]] [[H3069|GOD]] [[H559|says:]] [[H6951|‘Bring a mob]] [[H5921|against them]] [[H5414|and consign]] [[H853|them]] [[H2189|to terror]] [[H957|and plunder.]] ^2346

[[H3651|Therefore,]] [[H3541|this is what]] [[H136|the Lord]] [[H3068|GOD]] [[H559|says:]] [[H518|‘Surely]] [[H784|in My burning]] [[H7068|zeal]] [[H1696|I have spoken]] [[H5921|against]] [[H7611|the rest]] [[H1471|of the nations,]] [[H5921|and against]] [[H3605|all]] [[H123|of Edom,]] [[H834|who]] [[H5414|took]] [[H776|My land]] [[H4181|as their own possession]] [[H3605|with wholehearted]] [[H8057|joy]] [[H7589|and with utter contempt,]] [[H4616|so that]] [[H4054|its pastureland]] [[H957|became plunder.]] ^3605

[[H1121|“Son]] [[H120|of man,]] [[H1004|when the people]] [[H3478|of Israel]] [[H3427|lived]] [[H5921|in]] [[H127|their land,]] [[H2930|they defiled]] [[H853|it]] [[H1870|by their own ways]] [[H5949|and deeds.]] [[H1870|Their behavior]] [[H6440|before Me]] [[H1961|was]] [[H2932|like the uncleanness]] [[H5079|of a in her impurity.]] ⟨woman⟩ ⟨monthly⟩ ^3617

[[H8210|So I poured out]] [[H2534|My wrath]] [[H5921|upon them]] [[H5921|because of]] [[H1818|the blood]] [[H8210|they had shed]] [[H5921|on]] [[H776|the land,]] [[H2930|and because they had defiled]] [[H1544|it with their idols.]] ^3618

[[H6327|I dispersed]] [[H853|them]] [[H1471|among the nations,]] [[H2219|and they were scattered]] [[H776|throughout the lands.]] [[H8199|I judged them]] [[H1870|according to their ways]] [[H5949|and their deeds.]] ^3619

[[H3651|Therefore,]] [[H559|tell]] [[H1004|the house]] [[H3478|of Israel]] [[H3541|that this is what]] [[H136|the Lord]] [[H3069|GOD]] [[H559|says:]] [[H3808|‘It is not]] [[H4616|for your sake]] [[H589|that I]] [[H6213|will act,]] [[H1004|O house]] [[H3478|of Israel,]] [[H3588|but]] [[H6944|for My holy]] [[H8034|name,]] [[H834|which]] [[H2490|you profaned]] [[H1471|among the nations]] [[H834|to which]] [[H935|you went.]] ^3622

[[H3947|For I will take]] [[H853|you]] [[H4480|from among]] [[H1471|the nations]] [[H6908|and gather]] [[H853|you]] [[H3605|out of all]] [[H776|the countries,]] [[H935|and I will bring]] [[H853|you]] [[H413|back into]] [[H127|your own land.]] ^3624

[[H3808|It is not]] [[H4616|for your sake]] [[H589|that I]] [[H6213|will act,]] [[H5002|declares]] [[H136|the Lord]] [[H3069|GOD—]] [[H3045|let it be known]] [[H954|to you.  Be ashamed]] [[H3637|and disgraced]] [[H1870|for your own ways,]] [[H1004|O house]] [[H3478|of Israel!’]] ^3632

[[H5674|He led me]] [[H5439|all]] [[H5439|around]] [[H5921|among them,]] [[H2009|and I saw]] [[H3966|a great]] [[H7227|many]] ⟨bones⟩ [[H5921|on]] [[H6440|the floor]] [[H1237|of the valley,]] [[H2009|and indeed]] [[H3966|they were very]] [[H3002|dry.]] ^3702

[[H935|Then he came]] [[H413|to]] [[H8179|the gate]] [[H6440|facing]] [[H6921|east]] [[H5927|and climbed]] [[H4609|its steps.]] [[H4058|He measured]] [[H5592|the threshold]] [[H8179|of the gate]] ⟨to be⟩ [[H259|one]] [[H7070|rod]] [[H7341|deep.]] ^4006

[[H935|Then he brought]] [[H413|me into]] [[H2435|the outer]] [[H2691|court,]] [[H2009|and there]] [[H3957|were chambers]] [[H7531|and a pavement]] [[H6213|laid out]] [[H5439|all around]] [[H2691|the court.]] [[H7970|Thirty]] [[H3957|chambers]] [[H413|faced]] [[H7531|the pavement,]] ^4017

[[H7969|Its three]] [[H8372|gate chambers]] [[H6311|on each side,]] [[H352|its side pillars,]] [[H361|and its portico]] [[H1961|all had]] [[H4060|the same measurements]] [[H7223|as the first]] [[H8179|gate:]] [[H2572|fifty]] [[H520|cubits]] [[H753|long]] [[H6242|and twenty-five]] [[H520|cubits]] [[H7341|wide.]] ^4021

[[H8179|There was a gate]] [[H6442|to the inner]] [[H2691|court]] [[H5048|facing]] [[H6828|the north]] [[H8179|gate,]] [[H6921|just as there was on the east.]] [[H4058|He measured the distance]] [[H8179|from gateway]] [[H413|to]] [[H8179|gateway]] ⟨to be⟩ [[H3967|a hundred]] [[H520|cubits.]] ^4023

[[H1980|Then he led]] [[H1870|me to]] [[H1864|the south side,]] [[H2009|and I saw]] [[H8179|a gateway]] [[H1870|facing]] [[H1864|south.]] [[H4058|He measured]] [[H352|its side pillars]] [[H361|and portico,]] [[H4060|and they had the same measurements]] [[H428|as the others.]] ^4024

[[H361|Both the gateway and its portico]] [[H2474|had windows]] [[H5439|all around,]] [[H428|like the other]] [[H2474|windows.]] ⟨It was⟩ [[H2572|fifty]] [[H520|cubits]] [[H753|long]] [[H6242|and twenty-five]] [[H520|cubits]] [[H7341|wide.]] ^4025

[[H7651|Seven]] [[H4609|steps]] [[H5930|led up to it,]] [[H361|and its portico]] [[H6440|was opposite them;]] [[H8561|it had palm trees]] [[H413|on]] [[H352|its side pillars,]] [[H259|one]] [[H6311|on each side.]] ^4026

[[H6442|The inner]] [[H2691|court]] [[H8179|also had a gate]] [[H1870|facing]] [[H1864|south,]] [[H4058|and he measured]] ⟨the distance⟩ [[H8179|from gateway]] [[H413|to]] [[H8179|gateway]] [[H1870|toward]] [[H1864|the south]] ⟨to be⟩ [[H3967|a hundred]] [[H520|cubits.]] ^4027

[[H935|Next he brought me]] [[H413|into]] [[H6442|the inner]] [[H2691|court]] [[H1864|through the south]] [[H8179|gate,]] [[H4058|and he measured]] [[H1864|the south]] [[H8179|gate;]] [[H4060|it had the same measurements]] [[H428|as the others.]] ^4028

[[H8372|Its gate chambers,]] [[H352|side pillars,]] [[H361|and portico]] [[H4060|had the same measurements]] [[H428|as the others.]] [[H361|Both the gateway and its portico]] [[H2474|had windows]] [[H5439|all around;]] [[H2572|it fifty]] ⟨was⟩ [[H520|cubits]] [[H753|long]] [[H6242|and twenty-five]] [[H520|cubits]] [[H7341|wide.]] ^4029

[[H935|Then he brought]] [[H413|me to]] [[H6828|the north]] [[H8179|gate]] [[H4058|and measured]] ⟨it⟩. [[H4060|It had the same measurements]] [[H428|as the others,]] ^4035

[[H3957|There was a chamber]] [[H6607|with a doorway]] [[H352|by the portico]] [[H8179|in each of the inner gateways.]] [[H8033|There]] [[H5930|the burnt offering]] [[H1740|was to be washed.]] ^4038

[[H197|Inside the portico]] [[H8179|of the gateway]] ⟨were⟩ [[H8147|two]] [[H7979|tables]] [[H6311|on each side,]] [[H413|on which]] [[H5930|the burnt offerings,]] [[H2403|sin offerings,]] [[H817|and guilt offerings]] [[H7819|were to be slaughtered.]] ^4039

[[H2351|Outside]] [[H6442|the inner]] [[H8179|gate,]] [[H6442|within the inner]] [[H2691|court,]] [[H3957|were two chambers,]] [[H7891|one]] [[H413|beside]] [[H6828|the north]] [[H8179|gate]] [[H6440|and facing]] [[H1864|south,]] [[H259|and another]] [[H413|beside]] [[H8179|the south gate]] [[H6440|and facing]] [[H6828|north.]] ^4044

[[H1696|Then the man said]] [[H413|to me:]] [[H2090|“The]] [[H3957|chamber]] [[H834|that]] [[H6440|faces]] [[H1864|south]] [[H3548|is for the priests]] [[H8104|who have]] [[H4931|charge]] [[H1004|of the temple,]] ^4045

[[H3957|and the chamber]] [[H834|that]] [[H6440|faces]] [[H6828|north]] [[H3548|is for the priests]] [[H8104|who have]] [[H4931|charge]] [[H4196|of the altar.]] [[H1992|These]] [[H1121|are the sons]] [[H6659|of Zadok,]] [[H3878|the Levites]] ⟨only⟩ [[H7131|who may approach]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H8334|to minister before Him.”]] ^4046

[[H4058|Next he measured]] [[H2691|the court.]] [[H7251|It was square,]] [[H3967|a hundred]] [[H520|cubits]] [[H753|long]] [[H3967|and a hundred]] [[H520|cubits]] [[H7341|wide.]] [[H4196|And the altar]] ⟨was⟩ [[H6440|in front]] [[H1004|of the temple.]] ^4047

[[H935|Then he brought]] [[H413|me to]] [[H197|the portico]] [[H1004|of the temple]] [[H4058|and measured]] [[H352|the side pillars]] [[H197|of the portico]] ⟨to be⟩ [[H2568|five]] [[H520|cubits]] [[H6311|on each]] [[H6311|side.]] [[H7341|The width]] [[H8179|of the gateway was fourteen cubits and its sidewalls]] [[H7969|were three]] [[H520|cubits]] [[H6311|on either side.]] ^4048

[[H197|The portico]] ⟨was⟩ [[H6242|twenty]] [[H520|cubits]] [[H753|wide]] [[H6249|and twelve]] [[H520|cubits]] [[H7341|deep,]] [[H4609|and steps]] ⟨ten⟩ [[H5927|led up]] [[H413|to it.]] [[H5982|There were columns]] [[H413|by]] [[H352|the side pillars,]] [[H259|one]] [[H6311|on each side.]] ^4049

[[H935|Next he brought]] [[H413|me into]] [[H1964|the outer sanctuary]] [[H4058|and measured]] [[H352|the side pillars]] ⟨to be⟩ [[H8337|six]] [[H520|cubits]] [[H7341|wide]] [[H6311|on each side.]] ^4101

[[H7341|The width]] [[H6607|of the entrance]] ⟨was⟩ [[H6235|ten]] [[H520|cubits,]] [[H3802|and the sides]] [[H6607|of the entrance]] ⟨were⟩ [[H2568|five]] [[H520|cubits]] [[H6311|on each]] [[H6311|side.]] [[H4058|He also measured]] [[H753|the length]] ⟨of the outer sanctuary⟩ ⟨to be⟩ [[H705|forty]] [[H520|cubits,]] [[H7341|and the width]] [[H6242|twenty]] [[H520|cubits.]] ^4102

[[H935|Then he went]] [[H6441|into]] ⟨the inner sanctuary⟩ [[H4058|and measured]] [[H352|the side pillars]] [[H6607|at the entrance]] ⟨to be⟩ [[H8147|two]] [[H520|cubits]] ⟨wide⟩. [[H6607|The entrance]] ⟨was⟩ [[H8337|six]] [[H520|cubits]] ⟨wide⟩, ⟨and the walls on each side⟩ [[H6607|]] ⟨were⟩ [[H7651|seven]] [[H520|cubits]] [[H7341|wide.]] ^4103

[[H4058|Then he measured]] [[H413|the room adjacent to]] [[H1964|the inner sanctuary]] ⟨to be⟩ [[H6242|twenty]] [[H520|cubits]] [[H753|long]] ⟨and⟩ [[H6242|twenty]] [[H520|cubits]] [[H7341|wide.]] [[H559|And he said]] [[H413|to me,]] [[H2088|“This]] [[H6944|is the Most Holy Place.”]] ^4104

[[H4058|Next he measured]] [[H7023|the wall]] [[H1004|of the temple]] ⟨to be⟩ [[H8337|six]] [[H520|cubits]] ⟨thick⟩, [[H7341|and the width]] [[H5439|of each]] [[H6763|side room]] [[H5439|around]] [[H1004|the temple]] ⟨was⟩ [[H702|four]] [[H520|cubits.]] ^4105

[[H6763|The side rooms]] [[H6763|were arranged one]] [[H413|above]] [[H6763|another]] [[H7969|in three levels]] [[H7970|of thirty rooms each.]] [[H935|There were ledges]] [[H5439|all around]] [[H7023|the wall]] [[H1004|of the temple]] [[H1961|to serve as]] [[H270|supports]] [[H6763|for the side rooms,]] [[H270|so that the supports]] [[H3808|would not]] [[H1961|be into]] ⟨fastened⟩ [[H7023|the wall]] [[H1004|of the temple itself.]] ^4106

[[H6763|The side rooms]] [[H4141|surrounding]] [[H1004|the temple]] [[H7337|widened at each successive level,]] [[H5439|because the structure surrounding the temple]] [[H1004|ascended by stages]] [[H5921|corresponding to]] [[H7341|the narrowing of the temple wall]] [[H4605|as it rose upward.]] [[H3651|And so]] [[H5927|a stairway went up]] [[H8481|from the lowest]] [[H5921|story]] [[H5945|to the highest]] [[H8484|through the middle one.]] ^4107

[[H7200|I saw]] [[H1004|that the temple]] [[H1363|had a raised base]] [[H5439|all it]] [[H5439|around]] [[H3245|forming the foundation]] [[H6763|for the side rooms.]] [[H4393|It was the full length of]] [[H7070|a rod,]] [[H8337|six]] [[H679|long]] [[H520|cubits.]] ^4108

[[H2351|The outer]] [[H7023|wall]] [[H6763|of the side rooms]] ⟨was⟩ [[H2568|five]] [[H520|cubits]] [[H7341|thick,]] [[H834|and]] [[H3240|the open area]] [[H1004|between]] [[H6763|the side rooms]] [[H1004|of the temple]] ^4109

[[H3957|and the outer chambers]] ⟨was⟩ [[H6242|twenty]] [[H520|cubits]] [[H7341|wide]] [[H5439|all around]] [[H1004|the temple.]] ^4110

[[H6763|The side rooms]] [[H3240|opened into this area,]] [[H259|with one]] [[H6607|entrance]] [[H1870|on]] [[H6828|the north]] [[H259|and another]] [[H1864|on the south.]] [[H4725|The open area]] ⟨was⟩ [[H2568|five]] [[H520|cubits]] [[H7341|wide]] [[H5439|all around.]] ^4111

[[H1146|Now the building]] [[H834|that]] [[H413|faced]] [[H1508|the temple courtyard]] [[H1870|on]] [[H3220|the west]] ⟨was⟩ [[H7657|seventy]] [[H520|cubits]] [[H7341|wide,]] [[H7023|and the wall]] [[H1146|of the building]] ⟨was⟩ [[H2568|five]] [[H520|cubits]] [[H7341|thick]] [[H5439|all]] [[H5439|around]] [[H753|and a length]] [[H8673|of ninety]] [[H520|cubits.]] ^4112

[[H4058|Then the man measured]] [[H1004|the temple]] ⟨to be⟩ [[H3967|a hundred]] [[H520|cubits]] [[H753|long,]] [[H1508|and the temple courtyard]] [[H1140|and the building]] [[H7023|with its walls]] ⟨were⟩ [[H3967|also a hundred]] [[H520|cubits]] [[H753|long.]] ^4113

[[H7341|The width]] [[H1508|of the temple courtyard]] [[H6921|on the east,]] [[H6440|including the front]] [[H1004|of the temple,]] ⟨was⟩ [[H3967|a hundred]] [[H520|cubits.]] ^4114

[[H4058|Next he measured]] [[H753|the length]] [[H1146|of the building]] [[H413|facing]] [[H1508|the temple courtyard]] [[H5921|at]] [[H310|the rear]] ⟨of the temple⟩, [[H862|including its galleries]] [[H6311|on each side;]] [[H3967|it was a hundred]] [[H520|cubits.]] [[H1964|The outer sanctuary,]] [[H6442|the inner sanctuary,]] [[H197|and the porticoes]] [[H2691|facing the court,]] ^4115

[[H5592|as well as the thresholds]] [[H331|and the beveled]] [[H2474|windows]] [[H862|and the balconies]] [[H5439|all around]] [[H7969|with their three]] [[H5048|levels opposite]] [[H5592|the threshold,]] [[H7824|were overlaid with]] [[H6086|wood]] [[H5439|on all sides.]] [[H776|They were paneled from the ground]] [[H5704|to]] [[H2474|the windows,]] [[H2474|and the windows]] [[H3680|were covered.]] ^4116

[[H8561|were alternating]] [[H6213|carved]] [[H3742|cherubim]] [[H8561|and palm trees.]] [[H3742|Each cherub]] [[H8147|had two]] [[H6440|faces:]] ^4118

[[H6440|the face]] [[H120|of a man]] ⟨was⟩ [[H413|toward]] [[H8561|the palm tree]] [[H6311|on one side,]] [[H6440|and the face]] [[H3715|of a young lion]] ⟨was⟩ [[H413|toward]] [[H8561|the palm tree]] [[H6311|on the other side.]] [[H6213|They were carved]] [[H413|all the way around]] [[H1004|the temple.]] ^4119

[[H3742|Cherubim]] [[H8561|and palm trees]] [[H6213|were carved]] [[H7023|on the wall]] [[H1964|of the outer sanctuary]] [[H776|from the floor]] [[H5704|to]] [[H5921|the space above]] [[H6607|the entrance.]] ^4120

[[H1964|The outer sanctuary]] [[H7251|had a rectangular]] [[H4201|doorframe,]] [[H6440|and the]] ⟨doorframe⟩ [[H6944|of the sanctuary]] [[H4758|was similar.]] ^4121

[[H4196|There was an altar]] [[H6086|of wood]] [[H7969|three]] [[H520|cubits]] [[H1364|high]] [[H8147|and two]] [[H520|cubits]] [[H753|square.]] [[H4740|It had corners,]] [[H753|a base,]] [[H7023|and sides]] [[H6086|of wood.]] [[H1696|And the man told me,]] [[H2088|“This]] [[H7979|is the table]] [[H834|that]] [[H6440|is before]] [[H3069|the LORD.”]] ^4122

[[H1964|Both the outer sanctuary]] [[H6944|and the sanctuary]] [[H8147|had double]] [[H1817|doors,]] ^4123

[[H8147|and each]] [[H1817|door]] [[H8147|had two]] [[H4142|swinging]] [[H1817|panels.]] [[H8147|There were two]] [[H1817|panels]] [[H259|for one]] [[H1817|door]] [[H8147|and two]] [[H312|for the other.]] ^4124

[[H3742|Cherubim]] [[H8561|and palm trees]] [[H834|like those]] [[H7023|on the walls]] [[H6213|were carved]] [[H413|on]] [[H1817|the doors]] [[H1964|of the outer sanctuary,]] [[H6086|and there was a wooden]] [[H5646|canopy]] [[H2351|outside,]] [[H413|on]] [[H6440|the front]] [[H197|of the portico.]] ^4125

[[H331|There were beveled]] [[H2474|windows]] [[H8561|and palm trees]] [[H3802|on the side walls]] [[H197|of the portico.]] [[H6763|The side rooms]] [[H1004|of the temple]] [[H5646|also had canopies.]] ^4126

[[H3318|Then the man led me out]] [[H6828|northward]] [[H413|into]] [[H2435|the outer]] [[H2691|court,]] [[H935|and he brought me]] [[H413|to]] [[H3957|the group of chambers]] [[H5048|opposite]] [[H1508|the temple courtyard]] [[H5048|and]] [[H1146|the]] ⟨outer wall⟩ [[H413|on]] [[H6828|the north side.]] ^4201

[[H753|The building]] [[H6607|with the door]] [[H6828|facing north]] ⟨was⟩ [[H3967|a hundred]] [[H520|cubits]] [[H7341|long]] ⟨and⟩ [[H2572|fifty]] [[H520|cubits wide.]] ^4202

[[H862|Gallery]] [[H6440|faced]] [[H862|gallery]] [[H7992|in three levels,]] [[H5048|opposite]] [[H6242|the twenty]] ⟨cubits⟩ [[H834|that]] [[H6442|belonged to the inner]] [[H2691|court]] [[H5048|and opposite]] [[H7531|the pavement]] [[H834|that]] [[H2435|belonged to the outer]] [[H2691|court.]] ^4203

[[H6440|In front]] [[H3957|of the chambers]] ⟨was⟩ [[H4109|an inner walkway]] [[H6235|ten]] [[H520|cubits]] [[H7341|wide]] [[H259|and a]] ⟨hundred⟩ [[H520|cubits]] [[H1870|long.]] [[H6607|Their doors]] [[H6828|were on the north.]] ^4204

[[H5945|Now the upper]] [[H3957|chambers]] ⟨were⟩ [[H7114|smaller]] [[H3588|because]] [[H862|the galleries]] [[H3201|took more space]] [[H2007|from the chambers]] [[H8481|on the lower]] [[H8484|and middle floors]] [[H1146|of the building.]] ^4205

[[H3588|For]] [[H2007|they]] [[H8027|were arranged in three stories]] [[H369|and had no]] [[H5982|pillars]] [[H5982|like those]] [[H2691|of the courts;]] [[H5921|so]] [[H680|the upper chambers were set back further]] [[H8481|than the lower]] [[H8484|and middle floors.]] ^4206

[[H1447|A wall]] [[H2351|on the outside]] [[H413|ran in]] [[H6440|front]] [[H3957|of the chambers,]] [[H5980|parallel to them,]] [[H1870|toward]] [[H2435|the outer]] [[H2691|court,]] [[H2572|for fifty]] [[H520|cubits.]] ^4207

[[H3588|For]] [[H3957|the chambers]] [[H2435|on the outer]] [[H2691|court]] ⟨were⟩ [[H2572|fifty]] [[H520|cubits]] [[H753|long,]] [[H5921|while those facing]] [[H1964|the temple]] ⟨were⟩ [[H3967|a hundred]] [[H520|cubits]] ⟨long⟩. ^4208

[[H8478|And below]] [[H428|these]] [[H3957|chambers]] ⟨was⟩ [[H3996|the entrance]] [[H6921|on the east side]] [[H935|as one enters]] [[H2007|them]] [[H2435|from the outer]] [[H2691|court.]] ^4209

[[H1870|On the]] [[H6921|south side]] [[H7341|along the length]] [[H1444|of the wall]] [[H2691|of the outer court]] ⟨were⟩ [[H3957|chambers,]] [[H6440|adjoining]] [[H1508|the courtyard]] [[H413|and]] [[H6440|opposite]] [[H1146|the building,]] ^4210

[[H1870|with a passageway]] [[H6440|in front of them,]] [[H3957|just like the chambers]] [[H834|that were]] [[H1870|on]] [[H6828|the north.]] [[H753|They had the same length]] [[H7341|and width,]] [[H3605|as well as all]] [[H4161|their exits,]] [[H4941|measurements,]] [[H6607|and entrances.]] ^4211

[[H6607|And corresponding to the doors]] [[H3957|of the chambers]] [[H834|that]] ⟨were⟩ [[H1870|facing]] [[H1864|south,]] ⟨there⟩ ⟨was⟩ [[H6607|a door]] [[H7218|in front]] [[H1870|of the walkway]] [[H6440|that was parallel]] [[H1448|to the wall]] [[H1903|extending]] [[H6921|eastward.]] ^4212

[[H559|Then the man said]] [[H413|to me,]] [[H6828|“The north]] ⟨and⟩ [[H1864|south]] [[H3957|chambers]] [[H413|facing]] [[H1508|the temple courtyard]] [[H6944|are the holy]] [[H3957|chambers]] [[H834|where]] [[H3548|the priests]] [[H834|who]] [[H7138|approach]] [[H3069|the LORD]] [[H398|will eat]] [[H6944|the most holy offerings.]] [[H8033|There]] [[H3240|they will place]] [[H6944|the most holy offerings—]] [[H4503|the grain offerings,]] [[H2403|the sin offerings,]] [[H817|and the guilt offerings—]] [[H3588|for]] [[H4725|the place]] [[H6918|is holy.]] ^4213

[[H3548|Once the priests]] [[H935|have entered]] [[H6944|the holy area,]] [[H3808|they must not]] [[H3318|go out]] [[H413|into]] [[H2435|the outer]] [[H2691|court]] [[H3240|until they have left behind]] [[H899|the garments]] [[H8334|in which they minister,]] [[H3588|for]] [[H2007|these]] [[H6944|are holy.]] [[H3847|They are to put on]] [[H312|other]] [[H899|clothes]] [[H7126|before they approach]] [[H834|the places]] [[H834|that are]] [[H5971|for the people.]] ^4214

[[H3615|Now when had finished]] ⟨the man⟩ [[H4060|measuring]] [[H6442|the interior]] [[H1004|of the temple area,]] [[H3318|he led me out]] [[H1870|by]] [[H8179|the gate]] [[H834|that]] [[H6440|faced]] [[H6921|east,]] [[H4058|and he measured]] ⟨the area⟩ [[H5439|all]] [[H5439|around:]] ^4215

[[H4060|With a measuring]] [[H7070|rod]] [[H4058|he measured]] [[H6921|the east]] [[H7307|side]] ⟨to be⟩ [[H2568|five]] [[H520|hundred]] [[H7070|cubits]] ⟨long⟩ [[H5439|.]] ^4216

[[H4058|He measured]] [[H6828|the north]] [[H7307|side]] ⟨to be⟩ [[H2568|five]] [[H3967|hundred]] [[H7070|cubits]] ⟨long⟩ [[H4060|.]] ^4217

[[H4058|He measured]] [[H1864|the south]] [[H7307|side]] ⟨to be⟩ [[H2568|five]] [[H3967|hundred]] [[H7070|cubits]] ⟨long⟩ [[H4060|.]] ^4218

[[H5437|And he came around]] [[H4058|and measured]] [[H3220|the west]] [[H7307|side]] ⟨to be⟩ [[H2568|five]] [[H3967|hundred]] [[H7070|cubits]] ⟨long⟩ [[H4060|.]] ^4219

[[H4058|So he measured]] [[H702|the area on all four]] [[H7307|sides.]] [[H2346|It had a wall]] [[H5439|all]] [[H5439|around,]] [[H2568|five]] [[H3967|hundred]] ⟨cubits⟩ [[H753|long]] [[H2568|and five]] [[H3967|hundred]] ⟨cubits⟩ [[H7341|wide,]] [[H914|to separate]] [[H6944|the holy]] [[H2455|from the common.]] ^4220

[[H1980|Then the man brought me]] [[H413|back to]] [[H8179|the gate]] [[H834|that]] [[H6437|faces]] [[H6921|east,]] ^4301

[[H2009|and I saw]] [[H3519|the glory]] [[H430|of the God]] [[H3478|of Israel]] [[H935|coming]] [[H1870|from]] [[H6921|the east.]] [[H6963|His voice]] [[H6963|was like the roar]] [[H7227|of many]] [[H4325|waters,]] [[H776|and the earth]] [[H215|shone]] [[H3519|with His glory.]] ^4302

[[H4758|The vision]] [[H7200|I saw]] [[H4758|was like the one]] [[H7200|I had seen]] [[H935|when He came]] [[H7843|to destroy]] [[H5892|the city,]] [[H4758|and like the ones]] [[H7200|I had seen]] [[H413|by]] [[H5104|the River]] [[H3529|Kebar.]] [[H5307|I fell]] [[H413|facedown,]] ^4303

[[H3519|and the glory]] [[H3068|of the LORD]] [[H935|entered]] [[H1004|the temple]] [[H1870|through]] [[H8179|the gate]] [[H6440|facing]] [[H6921|east.]] ^4304

[[H7307|Then the Spirit]] [[H5375|lifted me up]] [[H935|and brought me]] [[H413|into]] [[H6442|the inner]] [[H2691|court,]] [[H3519|and the glory]] [[H3068|of the LORD]] [[H4390|filled]] [[H1004|the temple.]] ^4305

[[H3318|Next he brought me out]] [[H1870|through]] [[H6828|the north]] [[H8179|gate]] [[H5437|and led me around]] [[H2351|the outside]] [[H413|to]] [[H2351|the outer]] [[H8179|gate]] [[H6437|facing]] [[H6921|east,]] [[H2009|and there I saw]] [[H4325|the water]] [[H6349|trickling out]] [[H4480|from]] [[H3233|the south]] [[H3802|side.]] ^4702

[[H376|As the man]] [[H3318|went]] [[H6921|eastward]] [[H6957|with a measuring line]] [[H3027|in his hand,]] [[H4058|he measured off]] [[H505|a thousand]] [[H520|cubits]] [[H5674|and led me through]] [[H657|ankle-deep]] [[H4325|water.]] ^4703

[[H4058|Then he measured off]] [[H505|a thousand]] ⟨cubits⟩ [[H5674|and led me through]] [[H1290|knee-deep]] [[H4325|water.]] [[H4058|Again he measured]] [[H505|a thousand]] ⟨cubits⟩ [[H5674|and led me through]] [[H4975|waist-deep]] [[H4325|water.]] ^4704

[[H4058|Once again he measured off]] [[H505|a thousand]] ⟨cubits⟩, [[H5158|but now it was a river]] [[H834|that]] [[H3201|I could]] [[H3808|not]] [[H5674|cross,]] [[H3588|because]] [[H4325|the water]] [[H1342|had risen]] ⟨and⟩ [[H4325|]] [[H7813|was deep enough for swimming—]] [[H5158|a river]] [[H834|that]] [[H3808|could not]] [[H5674|be crossed on foot.]] ^4705

[[H7200|“Do you see this,]] [[H1121|son]] [[H120|of man?”]] [[H559|he asked.]] [[H1980|Then he led me]] [[H7725|back]] [[H8193|to the bank]] [[H5158|of the river.]] ^4706

[[H7725|When I arrived,]] [[H2009|I saw]] [[H3966|a great]] [[H7227|number of]] [[H6086|trees]] [[H2088|along both]] [[H8193|banks]] [[H5158|of the river.]] ^4707
