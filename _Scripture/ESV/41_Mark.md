The beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ, the Son of God. ^0101

As it is written in Isaiah the prophet, Behold, I send my messenger before your face, who will prepare your way, ^0102

the voice of one crying in the wilderness: 'Prepare the way of the Lord, make his paths straight,' ^0103

John appeared, baptizing in the wilderness and proclaiming a baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. ^0104

And all the country of Judea and all Jerusalem were going out to him and were being baptized by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins. ^0105

Now John was clothed with camel's hair and wore a leather belt around his waist and ate locusts and wild honey. ^0106

And he preached, saying, After me comes he who is mightier than I, the strap of whose sandals I am not worthy to stoop down and untie. ^0107

I have baptized you with water, but he will baptize you with the Holy Spirit. ^0108

In those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. ^0109

And when he came up out of the water, immediately he saw the heavens opening and the Spirit descending on him like a dove. ^0110

And a voice came from heaven, You are my beloved Son; with you I am well pleased. ^0111

The Spirit immediately drove him out into the wilderness. ^0112

And he was in the wilderness forty days, being tempted by Satan. And he was with the wild animals, and the angels were ministering to him. ^0113

Now after John was arrested, Jesus came into Galilee, proclaiming the gospel of God, ^0114

and saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand; repent and believe in the gospel. ^0115

Passing alongside the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew the brother of Simon casting a net into the sea, for they were fishermen. ^0116

And Jesus said to them, Follow me, and I will make you become fishers of men. ^0117

And immediately they left their nets and followed him. ^0118

And going on a little farther, he saw James the son of Zebedee and John his brother, who were in their boat mending the nets. ^0119

And immediately he called them, and they left their father Zebedee in the boat with the hired servants and followed him. ^0120

And they went into Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath he entered the synagogue and was teaching. ^0121

And they were astonished at his teaching, for he taught them as one who had authority, and not as the scribes. ^0122

And immediately there was in their synagogue a man with an unclean spirit. And he cried out, ^0123

What have you to do with us, Jesus of Nazareth? Have you come to destroy us? I know who you are--the Holy One of God. ^0124

But Jesus rebuked him, saying, Be silent, and come out of him! ^0125

And the unclean spirit, convulsing him and crying out with a loud voice, came out of him. ^0126

And they were all amazed, so that they questioned among themselves, saying, What is this? A new teaching with authority! He commands even the unclean spirits, and they obey him. ^0127

And at once his fame spread everywhere throughout all the surrounding region of Galilee. ^0128

And immediately he left the synagogue and entered the house of Simon and Andrew, with James and John. ^0129

Now Simon's mother-in-law lay ill with a fever, and immediately they told him about her. ^0130

And he came and took her by the hand and lifted her up, and the fever left her, and she began to serve them. ^0131

That evening at sundown they brought to him all who were sick or oppressed by demons. ^0132

And the whole city was gathered together at the door. ^0133

And he healed many who were sick with various diseases, and cast out many demons. And he would not permit the demons to speak, because they knew him. ^0134

And rising very early in the morning, while it was still dark, he departed and went out to a desolate place, and there he prayed. ^0135

And Simon and those who were with him searched for him, ^0136

and they found him and said to him, Everyone is looking for you. ^0137

And he said to them, Let us go on to the next towns, that I may preach there also, for that is why I came out. ^0138

And he went throughout all Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons. ^0139

And a leper came to him, imploring him, and kneeling said to him, If you will, you can make me clean. ^0140

Moved with pity, he stretched out his hand and touched him and said to him, I will; be clean. ^0141

And immediately the leprosy left him, and he was made clean. ^0142

And Jesus sternly charged him and sent him away at once, ^0143

and said to him, See that you say nothing to anyone, but go, show yourself to the priest and offer for your cleansing what Moses commanded, for a proof to them. ^0144

But he went out and began to talk freely about it, and to spread the news, so that Jesus could no longer openly enter a town, but was out in desolate places, and people were coming to him from every quarter. ^0145


And when he returned to Capernaum after some days, it was reported that he was at home. ^0201

And many were gathered together, so that there was no more room, not even at the door. And he was preaching the word to them. ^0202

And they came, bringing to him a paralytic carried by four men. ^0203

And when they could not get near him because of the crowd, they removed the roof above him, and when they had made an opening, they let down the bed on which the paralytic lay. ^0204

And when Jesus saw their faith, he said to the paralytic, My son, your sins are forgiven. ^0205

Now some of the scribes were sitting there, questioning in their hearts, ^0206

Why does this man speak like that? He is blaspheming! Who can forgive sins but God alone? ^0207

And immediately Jesus, perceiving in his spirit that they thus questioned within themselves, said to them, Why do you question these things in your hearts? ^0208

Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Rise, take up your bed and walk'? ^0209

But that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins--he said to the paralytic-- ^0210

I say to you, rise, pick up your bed, and go home. ^0211

And he rose and immediately picked up his bed and went out before them all, so that they were all amazed and glorified God, saying, We never saw anything like this! ^0212

He went out again beside the sea, and all the crowd was coming to him, and he was teaching them. ^0213

And as he passed by, he saw Levi the son of Alphaeus sitting at the tax booth, and he said to him, Follow me. And he rose and followed him. ^0214

And as he reclined at table in his house, many tax collectors and sinners were reclining with Jesus and his disciples, for there were many who followed him. ^0215

And the scribes of the Pharisees, when they saw that he was eating with sinners and tax collectors, said to his disciples, Why does he eat with tax collectors and sinners? ^0216

And when Jesus heard it, he said to them, Those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick. I came not to call the righteous, but sinners. ^0217

Now John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. And people came and said to him, Why do John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees fast, but your disciples do not fast? ^0218

And Jesus said to them, Can the wedding guests fast while the bridegroom is with them? As long as they have the bridegroom with them, they cannot fast. ^0219

The days will come when the bridegroom is taken away from them, and then they will fast in that day. ^0220

No one sews a piece of unshrunk cloth on an old garment. If he does, the patch tears away from it, the new from the old, and a worse tear is made. ^0221

And no one puts new wine into old wineskins. If he does, the wine will burst the skins--and the wine is destroyed, and so are the skins. But new wine is for fresh wineskins. ^0222

One Sabbath he was going through the grainfields, and as they made their way, his disciples began to pluck heads of grain. ^0223

And the Pharisees were saying to him, Look, why are they doing what is not lawful on the Sabbath? ^0224

And he said to them, Have you never read what David did, when he was in need and was hungry, he and those who were with him: ^0225

how he entered the house of God, in the time of Abiathar the high priest, and ate the bread of the Presence, which it is not lawful for any but the priests to eat, and also gave it to those who were with him? ^0226

And he said to them, The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath. ^0227

So the Son of Man is lord even of the Sabbath. ^0228


Again he entered the synagogue, and a man was there with a withered hand. ^0301

And they watched Jesus, to see whether he would heal him on the Sabbath, so that they might accuse him. ^0302

And he said to the man with the withered hand, Come here. ^0303

And he said to them, Is it lawful on the Sabbath to do good or to do harm, to save life or to kill? But they were silent. ^0304

And he looked around at them with anger, grieved at their hardness of heart, and said to the man, Stretch out your hand. He stretched it out, and his hand was restored. ^0305

The Pharisees went out and immediately held counsel with the Herodians against him, how to destroy him. ^0306

Jesus withdrew with his disciples to the sea, and a great crowd followed, from Galilee and Judea ^0307

and Jerusalem and Idumea and from beyond the Jordan and from around Tyre and Sidon. When the great crowd heard all that he was doing, they came to him. ^0308

And he told his disciples to have a boat ready for him because of the crowd, lest they crush him, ^0309

for he had healed many, so that all who had diseases pressed around him to touch him. ^0310

And whenever the unclean spirits saw him, they fell down before him and cried out, You are the Son of God. ^0311

And he strictly ordered them not to make him known. ^0312

And he went up on the mountain and called to him those whom he desired, and they came to him. ^0313

And he appointed twelve (whom he also named apostles) so that they might be with him and he might send them out to preach ^0314

and have authority to cast out demons. ^0315

He appointed the twelve: Simon (to whom he gave the name Peter); ^0316

James the son of Zebedee and John the brother of James (to whom he gave the name Boanerges, that is, Sons of Thunder); ^0317

Andrew, and Philip, and Bartholomew, and Matthew, and Thomas, and James the son of Alphaeus, and Thaddaeus, and Simon the Cananaean, ^0318

and Judas Iscariot, who betrayed him. ^0319

Then he went home, and the crowd gathered again, so that they could not even eat. ^0320

And when his family heard it, they went out to seize him, for they were saying, He is out of his mind. ^0321

And the scribes who came down from Jerusalem were saying, He is possessed by Beelzebul, and by the prince of demons he casts out the demons. ^0322

And he called them to him and said to them in parables, How can Satan cast out Satan? ^0323

If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand. ^0324

And if a house is divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand. ^0325

And if Satan has risen up against himself and is divided, he cannot stand, but is coming to an end. ^0326

But no one can enter a strong man's house and plunder his goods, unless he first binds the strong man. Then indeed he may plunder his house. ^0327

Truly, I say to you, all sins will be forgiven the children of man, and whatever blasphemies they utter, ^0328

but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but is guilty of an eternal sin-- ^0329

for they had said, He has an unclean spirit. ^0330

And his mother and his brothers came, and standing outside they sent to him and called him. ^0331

And a crowd was sitting around him, and they said to him, Your mother and your brothers are outside, seeking you. ^0332

And he answered them, Who are my mother and my brothers? ^0333

And looking about at those who sat around him, he said, Here are my mother and my brothers! ^0334

Whoever does the will of God, he is my brother and sister and mother. ^0335


Again he began to teach beside the sea. And a very large crowd gathered about him, so that he got into a boat and sat in it on the sea, and the whole crowd was beside the sea on the land. ^0401

And he was teaching them many things in parables, and in his teaching he said to them: ^0402

Listen! A sower went out to sow. ^0403

And as he sowed, some seed fell along the path, and the birds came and devoured it. ^0404

Other seed fell on rocky ground, where it did not have much soil, and immediately it sprang up, since it had no depth of soil. ^0405

And when the sun rose it was scorched, and since it had no root, it withered away. ^0406

Other seed fell among thorns, and the thorns grew up and choked it, and it yielded no grain. ^0407

And other seeds fell into good soil and produced grain, growing up and increasing and yielding thirtyfold and sixtyfold and a hundredfold. ^0408

And he said, He who has ears to hear, let him hear. ^0409

And when he was alone, those around him with the twelve asked him about the parables. ^0410

And he said to them, To you has been given the secret of the kingdom of God, but for those outside everything is in parables, ^0411

so that they may indeed see but not perceive, and may indeed hear but not understand, lest they should turn and be forgiven. ^0412

And he said to them, Do you not understand this parable? How then will you understand all the parables? ^0413

The sower sows the word. ^0414

And these are the ones along the path, where the word is sown: when they hear, Satan immediately comes and takes away the word that is sown in them. ^0415

And these are the ones sown on rocky ground: the ones who, when they hear the word, immediately receive it with joy. ^0416

And they have no root in themselves, but endure for a while; then, when tribulation or persecution arises on account of the word, immediately they fall away. ^0417

And others are the ones sown among thorns. They are those who hear the word, ^0418

but the cares of the world and the deceitfulness of riches and the desires for other things enter in and choke the word, and it proves unfruitful. ^0419

But those that were sown on the good soil are the ones who hear the word and accept it and bear fruit, thirtyfold and sixtyfold and a hundredfold. ^0420

And he said to them, Is a lamp brought in to be put under a basket, or under a bed, and not on a stand? ^0421

For nothing is hidden except to be made manifest; nor is anything secret except to come to light. ^0422

If anyone has ears to hear, let him hear. ^0423

And he said to them, Pay attention to what you hear: with the measure you use, it will be measured to you, and still more will be added to you. ^0424

For to the one who has, more will be given, and from the one who has not, even what he has will be taken away. ^0425

And he said, The kingdom of God is as if a man should scatter seed on the ground. ^0426

He sleeps and rises night and day, and the seed sprouts and grows; he knows not how. ^0427

The earth produces by itself, first the blade, then the ear, then the full grain in the ear. ^0428

But when the grain is ripe, at once he puts in the sickle, because the harvest has come. ^0429

And he said, With what can we compare the kingdom of God, or what parable shall we use for it? ^0430

It is like a grain of mustard seed, which, when sown on the ground, is the smallest of all the seeds on earth, ^0431

yet when it is sown it grows up and becomes larger than all the garden plants and puts out large branches, so that the birds of the air can make nests in its shade. ^0432

With many such parables he spoke the word to them, as they were able to hear it. ^0433

He did not speak to them without a parable, but privately to his own disciples he explained everything. ^0434

On that day, when evening had come, he said to them, Let us go across to the other side. ^0435

And leaving the crowd, they took him with them in the boat, just as he was. And other boats were with him. ^0436

And a great windstorm arose, and the waves were breaking into the boat, so that the boat was already filling. ^0437

But he was in the stern, asleep on the cushion. And they woke him and said to him, Teacher, do you not care that we are perishing? ^0438

And he awoke and rebuked the wind and said to the sea, Peace! Be still! And the wind ceased, and there was a great calm. ^0439

He said to them, Why are you so afraid? Have you still no faith? ^0440

And they were filled with great fear and said to one another, Who then is this, that even wind and sea obey him? ^0441


They came to the other side of the sea, to the country of the Gerasenes. ^0501

And when Jesus had stepped out of the boat, immediately there met him out of the tombs a man with an unclean spirit. ^0502

He lived among the tombs. And no one could bind him anymore, not even with a chain, ^0503

for he had often been bound with shackles and chains, but he wrenched the chains apart, and he broke the shackles in pieces. No one had the strength to subdue him. ^0504

Night and day among the tombs and on the mountains he was always crying out and bruising himself with stones. ^0505

And when he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and fell down before him. ^0506

And crying out with a loud voice, he said, What have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God? I adjure you by God, do not torment me. ^0507

For he was saying to him, Come out of the man, you unclean spirit! ^0508

And Jesus asked him, What is your name? He replied, My name is Legion, for we are many. ^0509

And he begged him earnestly not to send them out of the country. ^0510

Now a great herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside, ^0511

and they begged him, saying, Send us to the pigs; let us enter them. ^0512

So he gave them permission. And the unclean spirits came out, and entered the pigs, and the herd, numbering about two thousand, rushed down the steep bank into the sea and were drowned in the sea. ^0513

The herdsmen fled and told it in the city and in the country. And people came to see what it was that had happened. ^0514

And they came to Jesus and saw the demon-possessed man, the one who had had the legion, sitting there, clothed and in his right mind, and they were afraid. ^0515

And those who had seen it described to them what had happened to the demon-possessed man and to the pigs. ^0516

And they began to beg Jesus to depart from their region. ^0517

As he was getting into the boat, the man who had been possessed with demons begged him that he might be with him. ^0518

And he did not permit him but said to him, Go home to your friends and tell them how much the Lord has done for you, and how he has had mercy on you. ^0519

And he went away and began to proclaim in the Decapolis how much Jesus had done for him, and everyone marveled. ^0520

And when Jesus had crossed again in the boat to the other side, a great crowd gathered about him, and he was beside the sea. ^0521

Then came one of the rulers of the synagogue, Jairus by name, and seeing him, he fell at his feet ^0522

and implored him earnestly, saying, My little daughter is at the point of death. Come and lay your hands on her, so that she may be made well and live. ^0523

And he went with him.And a great crowd followed him and thronged about him. ^0524

And there was a woman who had had a discharge of blood for twelve years, ^0525

and who had suffered much under many physicians, and had spent all that she had, and was no better but rather grew worse. ^0526

She had heard the reports about Jesus and came up behind him in the crowd and touched his garment. ^0527

For she said, If I touch even his garments, I will be made well. ^0528

And immediately the flow of blood dried up, and she felt in her body that she was healed of her disease. ^0529

And Jesus, perceiving in himself that power had gone out from him, immediately turned about in the crowd and said, Who touched my garments? ^0530

And his disciples said to him, You see the crowd pressing around you, and yet you say, 'Who touched me?' ^0531

And he looked around to see who had done it. ^0532

But the woman, knowing what had happened to her, came in fear and trembling and fell down before him and told him the whole truth. ^0533

And he said to her, Daughter, your faith has made you well; go in peace, and be healed of your disease. ^0534

While he was still speaking, there came from the ruler's house some who said, Your daughter is dead. Why trouble the Teacher any further? ^0535

But overhearing what they said, Jesus said to the ruler of the synagogue, Do not fear, only believe. ^0536

And he allowed no one to follow him except Peter and James and John the brother of James. ^0537

They came to the house of the ruler of the synagogue, and Jesus saw a commotion, people weeping and wailing loudly. ^0538

And when he had entered, he said to them, Why are you making a commotion and weeping? The child is not dead but sleeping. ^0539

And they laughed at him. But he put them all outside and took the child's father and mother and those who were with him and went in where the child was. ^0540

Taking her by the hand he said to her, Talitha cumi, which means, Little girl, I say to you, arise. ^0541

And immediately the girl got up and began walking (for she was twelve years of age), and they were immediately overcome with amazement. ^0542

And he strictly charged them that no one should know this, and told them to give her something to eat. ^0543


He went away from there and came to his hometown, and his disciples followed him. ^0601

And on the Sabbath he began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard him were astonished, saying, Where did this man get these things? What is the wisdom given to him? How are such mighty works done by his hands? ^0602

Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon? And are not his sisters here with us? And they took offense at him. ^0603

And Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honor, except in his hometown and among his relatives and in his own household. ^0604

And he could do no mighty work there, except that he laid his hands on a few sick people and healed them. ^0605

And he marveled because of their unbelief.And he went about among the villages teaching. ^0606

And he called the twelve and began to send them out two by two, and gave them authority over the unclean spirits. ^0607

He charged them to take nothing for their journey except a staff--no bread, no bag, no money in their belts-- ^0608

but to wear sandals and not put on two tunics. ^0609

And he said to them, Whenever you enter a house, stay there until you depart from there. ^0610

And if any place will not receive you and they will not listen to you, when you leave, shake off the dust that is on your feet as a testimony against them. ^0611

So they went out and proclaimed that people should repent. ^0612

And they cast out many demons and anointed with oil many who were sick and healed them. ^0613

King Herod heard of it, for Jesus' name had become known. Some said, John the Baptist has been raised from the dead. That is why these miraculous powers are at work in him. ^0614

But others said, He is Elijah. And others said, He is a prophet, like one of the prophets of old. ^0615

But when Herod heard of it, he said, John, whom I beheaded, has been raised. ^0616

For it was Herod who had sent and seized John and bound him in prison for the sake of Herodias, his brother Philip's wife, because he had married her. ^0617

For John had been saying to Herod, It is not lawful for you to have your brother's wife. ^0618

And Herodias had a grudge against him and wanted to put him to death. But she could not, ^0619

for Herod feared John, knowing that he was a righteous and holy man, and he kept him safe. When he heard him, he was greatly perplexed, and yet he heard him gladly. ^0620

But an opportunity came when Herod on his birthday gave a banquet for his nobles and military commanders and the leading men of Galilee. ^0621

For when Herodias's daughter came in and danced, she pleased Herod and his guests. And the king said to the girl, Ask me for whatever you wish, and I will give it to you. ^0622

And he vowed to her, Whatever you ask me, I will give you, up to half of my kingdom. ^0623

And she went out and said to her mother, For what should I ask? And she said, The head of John the Baptist. ^0624

And she came in immediately with haste to the king and asked, saying, I want you to give me at once the head of John the Baptist on a platter. ^0625

And the king was exceedingly sorry, but because of his oaths and his guests he did not want to break his word to her. ^0626

And immediately the king sent an executioner with orders to bring John's head. He went and beheaded him in the prison ^0627

and brought his head on a platter and gave it to the girl, and the girl gave it to her mother. ^0628

When his disciples heard of it, they came and took his body and laid it in a tomb. ^0629

The apostles returned to Jesus and told him all that they had done and taught. ^0630

And he said to them, Come away by yourselves to a desolate place and rest a while. For many were coming and going, and they had no leisure even to eat. ^0631

And they went away in the boat to a desolate place by themselves. ^0632

Now many saw them going and recognized them, and they ran there on foot from all the towns and got there ahead of them. ^0633

When he went ashore he saw a great crowd, and he had compassion on them, because they were like sheep without a shepherd. And he began to teach them many things. ^0634

And when it grew late, his disciples came to him and said, This is a desolate place, and the hour is now late. ^0635

Send them away to go into the surrounding countryside and villages and buy themselves something to eat. ^0636

But he answered them, You give them something to eat. And they said to him, Shall we go and buy two hundred denarii worth of bread and give it to them to eat? ^0637

And he said to them, How many loaves do you have? Go and see. And when they had found out, they said, Five, and two fish. ^0638

Then he commanded them all to sit down in groups on the green grass. ^0639

So they sat down in groups, by hundreds and by fifties. ^0640

And taking the five loaves and the two fish he looked up to heaven and said a blessing and broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples to set before the people. And he divided the two fish among them all. ^0641

And they all ate and were satisfied. ^0642

And they took up twelve baskets full of broken pieces and of the fish. ^0643

And those who ate the loaves were five thousand men. ^0644

Immediately he made his disciples get into the boat and go before him to the other side, to Bethsaida, while he dismissed the crowd. ^0645

And after he had taken leave of them, he went up on the mountain to pray. ^0646

And when evening came, the boat was out on the sea, and he was alone on the land. ^0647

And he saw that they were making headway painfully, for the wind was against them. And about the fourth watch of the night he came to them, walking on the sea. He meant to pass by them, ^0648

but when they saw him walking on the sea they thought it was a ghost, and cried out, ^0649

for they all saw him and were terrified. But immediately he spoke to them and said, Take heart; it is I. Do not be afraid. ^0650

And he got into the boat with them, and the wind ceased. And they were utterly astounded, ^0651

for they did not understand about the loaves, but their hearts were hardened. ^0652

When they had crossed over, they came to land at Gennesaret and moored to the shore. ^0653

And when they got out of the boat, the people immediately recognized him ^0654

and ran about the whole region and began to bring the sick people on their beds to wherever they heard he was. ^0655

And wherever he came, in villages, cities, or countryside, they laid the sick in the marketplaces and implored him that they might touch even the fringe of his garment. And as many as touched it were made well. ^0656


Now when the Pharisees gathered to him, with some of the scribes who had come from Jerusalem, ^0701

they saw that some of his disciples ate with hands that were defiled, that is, unwashed. ^0702

(For the Pharisees and all the Jews do not eat unless they wash their hands, holding to the tradition of the elders, ^0703

and when they come from the marketplace, they do not eat unless they wash. And there are many other traditions that they observe, such as the washing of cups and pots and copper vessels and dining couches. ) ^0704

And the Pharisees and the scribes asked him, Why do your disciples not walk according to the tradition of the elders, but eat with defiled hands? ^0705

And he said to them, Well did Isaiah prophesy of you hypocrites, as it is written, 'This people honors me with their lips, but their heart is far from me; ^0706

in vain do they worship me, teaching as doctrines the commandments of men.' ^0707

You leave the commandment of God and hold to the tradition of men. ^0708

And he said to them, You have a fine way of rejecting the commandment of God in order to establish your tradition! ^0709

For Moses said, 'Honor your father and your mother'; and, 'Whoever reviles father or mother must surely die.' ^0710

But you say, 'If a man tells his father or his mother, Whatever you would have gained from me is Corban' (that is, given to God)-- ^0711

then you no longer permit him to do anything for his father or mother, ^0712

thus making void the word of God by your tradition that you have handed down. And many such things you do. ^0713

And he called the people to him again and said to them, Hear me, all of you, and understand: ^0714

There is nothing outside a person that by going into him can defile him, but the things that come out of a person are what defile him. ^0715

See Footnote ^0716

And when he had entered the house and left the people, his disciples asked him about the parable. ^0717

And he said to them, Then are you also without understanding? Do you not see that whatever goes into a person from outside cannot defile him, ^0718

since it enters not his heart but his stomach, and is expelled? (Thus he declared all foods clean.) ^0719

And he said, What comes out of a person is what defiles him. ^0720

For from within, out of the heart of man, come evil thoughts, sexual immorality, theft, murder, adultery, ^0721

coveting, wickedness, deceit, sensuality, envy, slander, pride, foolishness. ^0722

All these evil things come from within, and they defile a person. ^0723

And from there he arose and went away to the region of Tyre and Sidon. And he entered a house and did not want anyone to know, yet he could not be hidden. ^0724

But immediately a woman whose little daughter was possessed by an unclean spirit heard of him and came and fell down at his feet. ^0725

Now the woman was a Gentile, a Syrophoenician by birth. And she begged him to cast the demon out of her daughter. ^0726

And he said to her, Let the children be fed first, for it is not right to take the children's bread and throw it to the dogs. ^0727

But she answered him, Yes, Lord; yet even the dogs under the table eat the children's crumbs. ^0728

And he said to her, For this statement you may go your way; the demon has left your daughter. ^0729

And she went home and found the child lying in bed and the demon gone. ^0730

Then he returned from the region of Tyre and went through Sidon to the Sea of Galilee, in the region of the Decapolis. ^0731

And they brought to him a man who was deaf and had a speech impediment, and they begged him to lay his hand on him. ^0732

And taking him aside from the crowd privately, he put his fingers into his ears, and after spitting touched his tongue. ^0733

And looking up to heaven, he sighed and said to him, Ephphatha, that is, Be opened. ^0734

And his ears were opened, his tongue was released, and he spoke plainly. ^0735

And Jesus charged them to tell no one. But the more he charged them, the more zealously they proclaimed it. ^0736

And they were astonished beyond measure, saying, He has done all things well. He even makes the deaf hear and the mute speak. ^0737


In those days, when again a great crowd had gathered, and they had nothing to eat, he called his disciples to him and said to them, ^0801

I have compassion on the crowd, because they have been with me now three days and have nothing to eat. ^0802

And if I send them away hungry to their homes, they will faint on the way. And some of them have come from far away. ^0803

And his disciples answered him, How can one feed these people with bread here in this desolate place? ^0804

And he asked them, How many loaves do you have? They said, Seven. ^0805

And he directed the crowd to sit down on the ground. And he took the seven loaves, and having given thanks, he broke them and gave them to his disciples to set before the people; and they set them before the crowd. ^0806

And they had a few small fish. And having blessed them, he said that these also should be set before them. ^0807

And they ate and were satisfied. And they took up the broken pieces left over, seven baskets full. ^0808

And there were about four thousand people. And he sent them away. ^0809

And immediately he got into the boat with his disciples and went to the district of Dalmanutha. ^0810

The Pharisees came and began to argue with him, seeking from him a sign from heaven to test him. ^0811

And he sighed deeply in his spirit and said, Why does this generation seek a sign? Truly, I say to you, no sign will be given to this generation. ^0812

And he left them, got into the boat again, and went to the other side. ^0813

Now they had forgotten to bring bread, and they had only one loaf with them in the boat. ^0814

And he cautioned them, saying, Watch out; beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod. ^0815

And they began discussing with one another the fact that they had no bread. ^0816

And Jesus, aware of this, said to them, Why are you discussing the fact that you have no bread? Do you not yet perceive or understand? Are your hearts hardened? ^0817

Having eyes do you not see, and having ears do you not hear? And do you not remember? ^0818

When I broke the five loaves for the five thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up? They said to him, Twelve. ^0819

And the seven for the four thousand, how many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up? And they said to him, Seven. ^0820

And he said to them, Do you not yet understand? ^0821

And they came to Bethsaida. And some people brought to him a blind man and begged him to touch him. ^0822

And he took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the village, and when he had spit on his eyes and laid his hands on him, he asked him, Do you see anything? ^0823

And he looked up and said, I see men, but they look like trees, walking. ^0824

Then Jesus laid his hands on his eyes again; and he opened his eyes, his sight was restored, and he saw everything clearly. ^0825

And he sent him to his home, saying, Do not even enter the village. ^0826

And Jesus went on with his disciples to the villages of Caesarea Philippi. And on the way he asked his disciples, Who do people say that I am? ^0827

And they told him, John the Baptist; and others say, Elijah; and others, one of the prophets. ^0828

And he asked them, But who do you say that I am? Peter answered him, You are the Christ. ^0829

And he strictly charged them to tell no one about him. ^0830

And he began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes and be killed, and after three days rise again. ^0831

And he said this plainly. And Peter took him aside and began to rebuke him. ^0832

But turning and seeing his disciples, he rebuked Peter and said, Get behind me, Satan! For you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of man. ^0833

And he called to him the crowd with his disciples and said to them, If anyone would come after me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. ^0834

For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life for my sake and the gospel's will save it. ^0835

For what does it profit a man to gain the whole world and forfeit his life? ^0836

For what can a man give in return for his life? ^0837

For whoever is ashamed of me and of my words in this adulterous and sinful generation, of him will the Son of Man also be ashamed when he comes in the glory of his Father with the holy angels. ^0838


And he said to them, Truly, I say to you, there are some standing here who will not taste death until they see the kingdom of God after it has come with power. ^0901

And after six days Jesus took with him Peter and James and John, and led them up a high mountain by themselves. And he was transfigured before them, ^0902

and his clothes became radiant, intensely white, as no one on earth could bleach them. ^0903

And there appeared to them Elijah with Moses, and they were talking with Jesus. ^0904

And Peter said to Jesus, Rabbi, it is good that we are here. Let us make three tents, one for you and one for Moses and one for Elijah. ^0905

For he did not know what to say, for they were terrified. ^0906

And a cloud overshadowed them, and a voice came out of the cloud, This is my beloved Son; listen to him. ^0907

And suddenly, looking around, they no longer saw anyone with them but Jesus only. ^0908

And as they were coming down the mountain, he charged them to tell no one what they had seen, until the Son of Man had risen from the dead. ^0909

So they kept the matter to themselves, questioning what this rising from the dead might mean. ^0910

And they asked him, Why do the scribes say that first Elijah must come? ^0911

And he said to them, Elijah does come first to restore all things. And how is it written of the Son of Man that he should suffer many things and be treated with contempt? ^0912

But I tell you that Elijah has come, and they did to him whatever they pleased, as it is written of him. ^0913

And when they came to the disciples, they saw a great crowd around them, and scribes arguing with them. ^0914

And immediately all the crowd, when they saw him, were greatly amazed and ran up to him and greeted him. ^0915

And he asked them, What are you arguing about with them? ^0916

And someone from the crowd answered him, Teacher, I brought my son to you, for he has a spirit that makes him mute. ^0917

And whenever it seizes him, it throws him down, and he foams and grinds his teeth and becomes rigid. So I asked your disciples to cast it out, and they were not able. ^0918

And he answered them, O faithless generation, how long am I to be with you? How long am I to bear with you? Bring him to me. ^0919

And they brought the boy to him. And when the spirit saw him, immediately it convulsed the boy, and he fell on the ground and rolled about, foaming at the mouth. ^0920

And Jesus asked his father, How long has this been happening to him? And he said, From childhood. ^0921

And it has often cast him into fire and into water, to destroy him. But if you can do anything, have compassion on us and help us. ^0922

And Jesus said to him, If you can! All things are possible for one who believes. ^0923

Immediately the father of the child cried out and said, I believe; help my unbelief! ^0924

And when Jesus saw that a crowd came running together, he rebuked the unclean spirit, saying to it, You mute and deaf spirit, I command you, come out of him and never enter him again. ^0925

And after crying out and convulsing him terribly, it came out, and the boy was like a corpse, so that most of them said, He is dead. ^0926

But Jesus took him by the hand and lifted him up, and he arose. ^0927

And when he had entered the house, his disciples asked him privately, Why could we not cast it out? ^0928

And he said to them, This kind cannot be driven out by anything but prayer. ^0929

They went on from there and passed through Galilee. And he did not want anyone to know, ^0930

for he was teaching his disciples, saying to them, The Son of Man is going to be delivered into the hands of men, and they will kill him. And when he is killed, after three days he will rise. ^0931

But they did not understand the saying, and were afraid to ask him. ^0932

And they came to Capernaum. And when he was in the house he asked them, What were you discussing on the way? ^0933

But they kept silent, for on the way they had argued with one another about who was the greatest. ^0934

And he sat down and called the twelve. And he said to them, If anyone would be first, he must be last of all and servant of all. ^0935

And he took a child and put him in the midst of them, and taking him in his arms, he said to them, ^0936

Whoever receives one such child in my name receives me, and whoever receives me, receives not me but him who sent me. ^0937

John said to him, Teacher, we saw someone casting out demons in your name, and we tried to stop him, because he was not following us. ^0938

But Jesus said, Do not stop him, for no one who does a mighty work in my name will be able soon afterward to speak evil of me. ^0939

For the one who is not against us is for us. ^0940

For truly, I say to you, whoever gives you a cup of water to drink because you belong to Christ will by no means lose his reward. ^0941

Whoever causes one of these little ones who believe in me to sin, it would be better for him if a great millstone were hung around his neck and he were thrown into the sea. ^0942

And if your hand causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life crippled than with two hands to go to hell, to the unquenchable fire. ^0943

See Footnote ^0944

And if your foot causes you to sin, cut it off. It is better for you to enter life lame than with two feet to be thrown into hell. ^0945

See Footnote ^0946

And if your eye causes you to sin, tear it out. It is better for you to enter the kingdom of God with one eye than with two eyes to be thrown into hell, ^0947

'where their worm does not die and the fire is not quenched.' ^0948

For everyone will be salted with fire. ^0949

Salt is good, but if the salt has lost its saltiness, how will you make it salty again? Have salt in yourselves, and be at peace with one another. ^0950


And he left there and went to the region of Judea and beyond the Jordan, and crowds gathered to him again. And again, as was his custom, he taught them. ^1001

And Pharisees came up and in order to test him asked, Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife? ^1002

He answered them, What did Moses command you? ^1003

They said, Moses allowed a man to write a certificate of divorce and to send her away. ^1004

And Jesus said to them, Because of your hardness of heart he wrote you this commandment. ^1005

But from the beginning of creation, 'God made them male and female.' ^1006

'Therefore a man shall leave his father and mother and hold fast to his wife, ^1007

and they shall become one flesh.' So they are no longer two but one flesh. ^1008

What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate. ^1009

And in the house the disciples asked him again about this matter. ^1010

And he said to them, Whoever divorces his wife and marries another commits adultery against her, ^1011

and if she divorces her husband and marries another, she commits adultery. ^1012

And they were bringing children to him that he might touch them, and the disciples rebuked them. ^1013

But when Jesus saw it, he was indignant and said to them, Let the children come to me; do not hinder them, for to such belongs the kingdom of God. ^1014

Truly, I say to you, whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it. ^1015

And he took them in his arms and blessed them, laying his hands on them. ^1016

And as he was setting out on his journey, a man ran up and knelt before him and asked him, Good Teacher, what must I do to inherit eternal life? ^1017

And Jesus said to him, Why do you call me good? No one is good except God alone. ^1018

You know the commandments: 'Do not murder, Do not commit adultery, Do not steal, Do not bear false witness, Do not defraud, Honor your father and mother.' ^1019

And he said to him, Teacher, all these I have kept from my youth. ^1020

And Jesus, looking at him, loved him, and said to him, You lack one thing: go, sell all that you have and give to the poor, and you will have treasure in heaven; and come, follow me. ^1021

Disheartened by the saying, he went away sorrowful, for he had great possessions. ^1022

And Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, How difficult it will be for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God! ^1023

And the disciples were amazed at his words. But Jesus said to them again, Children, how difficult it is to enter the kingdom of God! ^1024

It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God. ^1025

And they were exceedingly astonished, and said to him, Then who can be saved? ^1026

Jesus looked at them and said, With man it is impossible, but not with God. For all things are possible with God. ^1027

Peter began to say to him, See, we have left everything and followed you. ^1028

Jesus said, Truly, I say to you, there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or lands, for my sake and for the gospel, ^1029

who will not receive a hundredfold now in this time, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and lands, with persecutions, and in the age to come eternal life. ^1030

But many who are first will be last, and the last first. ^1031

And they were on the road, going up to Jerusalem, and Jesus was walking ahead of them. And they were amazed, and those who followed were afraid. And taking the twelve again, he began to tell them what was to happen to him, ^1032

saying, See, we are going up to Jerusalem, and the Son of Man will be delivered over to the chief priests and the scribes, and they will condemn him to death and deliver him over to the Gentiles. ^1033

And they will mock him and spit on him, and flog him and kill him. And after three days he will rise. ^1034

And James and John, the sons of Zebedee, came up to him and said to him, Teacher, we want you to do for us whatever we ask of you. ^1035

And he said to them, What do you want me to do for you? ^1036

And they said to him, Grant us to sit, one at your right hand and one at your left, in your glory. ^1037

Jesus said to them, You do not know what you are asking. Are you able to drink the cup that I drink, or to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized? ^1038

And they said to him, We are able. And Jesus said to them, The cup that I drink you will drink, and with the baptism with which I am baptized, you will be baptized, ^1039

but to sit at my right hand or at my left is not mine to grant, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared. ^1040

And when the ten heard it, they began to be indignant at James and John. ^1041

And Jesus called them to him and said to them, You know that those who are considered rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and their great ones exercise authority over them. ^1042

But it shall not be so among you. But whoever would be great among you must be your servant, ^1043

and whoever would be first among you must be slave of all. ^1044

For even the Son of Man came not to be served but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many. ^1045

And they came to Jericho. And as he was leaving Jericho with his disciples and a great crowd, Bartimaeus, a blind beggar, the son of Timaeus, was sitting by the roadside. ^1046

And when he heard that it was Jesus of Nazareth, he began to cry out and say, Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me! ^1047

And many rebuked him, telling him to be silent. But he cried out all the more, Son of David, have mercy on me! ^1048

And Jesus stopped and said, Call him. And they called the blind man, saying to him, Take heart. Get up; he is calling you. ^1049

And throwing off his cloak, he sprang up and came to Jesus. ^1050

And Jesus said to him, What do you want me to do for you? And the blind man said to him, Rabbi, let me recover my sight. ^1051

And Jesus said to him, Go your way; your faith has made you well. And immediately he recovered his sight and followed him on the way. ^1052


Now when they drew near to Jerusalem, to Bethphage and Bethany, at the Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples ^1101

and said to them, Go into the village in front of you, and immediately as you enter it you will find a colt tied, on which no one has ever sat. Untie it and bring it. ^1102

If anyone says to you, 'Why are you doing this?' say, 'The Lord has need of it and will send it back here immediately.' ^1103

And they went away and found a colt tied at a door outside in the street, and they untied it. ^1104

And some of those standing there said to them, What are you doing, untying the colt? ^1105

And they told them what Jesus had said, and they let them go. ^1106

And they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their cloaks on it, and he sat on it. ^1107

And many spread their cloaks on the road, and others spread leafy branches that they had cut from the fields. ^1108

And those who went before and those who followed were shouting, Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord! ^1109

Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David! Hosanna in the highest! ^1110

And he entered Jerusalem and went into the temple. And when he had looked around at everything, as it was already late, he went out to Bethany with the twelve. ^1111

On the following day, when they came from Bethany, he was hungry. ^1112

And seeing in the distance a fig tree in leaf, he went to see if he could find anything on it. When he came to it, he found nothing but leaves, for it was not the season for figs. ^1113

And he said to it, May no one ever eat fruit from you again. And his disciples heard it. ^1114

And they came to Jerusalem. And he entered the temple and began to drive out those who sold and those who bought in the temple, and he overturned the tables of the money-changers and the seats of those who sold pigeons. ^1115

And he would not allow anyone to carry anything through the temple. ^1116

And he was teaching them and saying to them, Is it not written, 'My house shall be called a house of prayer for all the nations'? But you have made it a den of robbers. ^1117

And the chief priests and the scribes heard it and were seeking a way to destroy him, for they feared him, because all the crowd was astonished at his teaching. ^1118

And when evening came they went out of the city. ^1119

As they passed by in the morning, they saw the fig tree withered away to its roots. ^1120

And Peter remembered and said to him, Rabbi, look! The fig tree that you cursed has withered. ^1121

And Jesus answered them, Have faith in God. ^1122

Truly, I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, 'Be taken up and thrown into the sea,' and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says will come to pass, it will be done for him. ^1123

Therefore I tell you, whatever you ask in prayer, believe that you have received it, and it will be yours. ^1124

And whenever you stand praying, forgive, if you have anything against anyone, so that your Father also who is in heaven may forgive you your trespasses. ^1125

See Footnote ^1126

And they came again to Jerusalem. And as he was walking in the temple, the chief priests and the scribes and the elders came to him, ^1127

and they said to him, By what authority are you doing these things, or who gave you this authority to do them? ^1128

Jesus said to them, I will ask you one question; answer me, and I will tell you by what authority I do these things. ^1129

Was the baptism of John from heaven or from man? Answer me. ^1130

And they discussed it with one another, saying, If we say, 'From heaven,' he will say, 'Why then did you not believe him?' ^1131

But shall we say, 'From man'?--they were afraid of the people, for they all held that John really was a prophet. ^1132

So they answered Jesus, We do not know. And Jesus said to them, Neither will I tell you by what authority I do these things. ^1133


And he began to speak to them in parables. A man planted a vineyard and put a fence around it and dug a pit for the winepress and built a tower, and leased it to tenants and went into another country. ^1201

When the season came, he sent a servant to the tenants to get from them some of the fruit of the vineyard. ^1202

And they took him and beat him and sent him away empty-handed. ^1203

Again he sent to them another servant, and they struck him on the head and treated him shamefully. ^1204

And he sent another, and him they killed. And so with many others: some they beat, and some they killed. ^1205

He had still one other, a beloved son. Finally he sent him to them, saying, 'They will respect my son.' ^1206

But those tenants said to one another, 'This is the heir. Come, let us kill him, and the inheritance will be ours.' ^1207

And they took him and killed him and threw him out of the vineyard. ^1208

What will the owner of the vineyard do? He will come and destroy the tenants and give the vineyard to others. ^1209

Have you not read this Scripture: 'The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone; ^1210

this was the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes'? ^1211

And they were seeking to arrest him but feared the people, for they perceived that he had told the parable against them. So they left him and went away. ^1212

And they sent to him some of the Pharisees and some of the Herodians, to trap him in his talk. ^1213

And they came and said to him, Teacher, we know that you are true and do not care about anyone's opinion. For you are not swayed by appearances, but truly teach the way of God. Is it lawful to pay taxes to Caesar, or not? Should we pay them, or should we not? ^1214

But, knowing their hypocrisy, he said to them, Why put me to the test? Bring me a denarius and let me look at it. ^1215

And they brought one. And he said to them, Whose likeness and inscription is this? They said to him, Caesar's. ^1216

Jesus said to them, Render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's, and to God the things that are God's. And they marveled at him. ^1217

And Sadducees came to him, who say that there is no resurrection. And they asked him a question, saying, ^1218

Teacher, Moses wrote for us that if a man's brother dies and leaves a wife, but leaves no child, the man must take the widow and raise up offspring for his brother. ^1219

There were seven brothers; the first took a wife, and when he died left no offspring. ^1220

And the second took her, and died, leaving no offspring. And the third likewise. ^1221

And the seven left no offspring. Last of all the woman also died. ^1222

In the resurrection, when they rise again, whose wife will she be? For the seven had her as wife. ^1223

Jesus said to them, Is this not the reason you are wrong, because you know neither the Scriptures nor the power of God? ^1224

For when they rise from the dead, they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven. ^1225

And as for the dead being raised, have you not read in the book of Moses, in the passage about the bush, how God spoke to him, saying, 'I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'? ^1226

He is not God of the dead, but of the living. You are quite wrong. ^1227

And one of the scribes came up and heard them disputing with one another, and seeing that he answered them well, asked him, Which commandment is the most important of all? ^1228

Jesus answered, The most important is, 'Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one. ^1229

And you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.' ^1230

The second is this: 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.' There is no other commandment greater than these. ^1231

And the scribe said to him, You are right, Teacher. You have truly said that he is one, and there is no other besides him. ^1232

And to love him with all the heart and with all the understanding and with all the strength, and to love one's neighbor as oneself, is much more than all whole burnt offerings and sacrifices. ^1233

And when Jesus saw that he answered wisely, he said to him, You are not far from the kingdom of God. And after that no one dared to ask him any more questions. ^1234

And as Jesus taught in the temple, he said, How can the scribes say that the Christ is the son of David? ^1235

David himself, in the Holy Spirit, declared, 'The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand, until I put your enemies under your feet.' ^1236

David himself calls him Lord. So how is he his son? And the great throng heard him gladly. ^1237

And in his teaching he said, Beware of the scribes, who like to walk around in long robes and like greetings in the marketplaces ^1238

and have the best seats in the synagogues and the places of honor at feasts, ^1239

who devour widows' houses and for a pretense make long prayers. They will receive the greater condemnation. ^1240

And he sat down opposite the treasury and watched the people putting money into the offering box. Many rich people put in large sums. ^1241

And a poor widow came and put in two small copper coins, which make a penny. ^1242

And he called his disciples to him and said to them, Truly, I say to you, this poor widow has put in more than all those who are contributing to the offering box. ^1243

For they all contributed out of their abundance, but she out of her poverty has put in everything she had, all she had to live on. ^1244


And as he came out of the temple, one of his disciples said to him, Look, Teacher, what wonderful stones and what wonderful buildings! ^1301

And Jesus said to him, Do you see these great buildings? There will not be left here one stone upon another that will not be thrown down. ^1302

And as he sat on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter and James and John and Andrew asked him privately, ^1303

Tell us, when will these things be, and what will be the sign when all these things are about to be accomplished? ^1304

And Jesus began to say to them, See that no one leads you astray. ^1305

Many will come in my name, saying, 'I am he!' and they will lead many astray. ^1306

And when you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be alarmed. This must take place, but the end is not yet. ^1307

For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places; there will be famines. These are but the beginning of the birth pains. ^1308

But be on your guard. For they will deliver you over to councils, and you will be beaten in synagogues, and you will stand before governors and kings for my sake, to bear witness before them. ^1309

And the gospel must first be proclaimed to all nations. ^1310

And when they bring you to trial and deliver you over, do not be anxious beforehand what you are to say, but say whatever is given you in that hour, for it is not you who speak, but the Holy Spirit. ^1311

And brother will deliver brother over to death, and the father his child, and children will rise against parents and have them put to death. ^1312

And you will be hated by all for my name's sake. But the one who endures to the end will be saved. ^1313

But when you see the abomination of desolation standing where it ought not to be (let the reader understand), then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. ^1314

Let the one who is on the housetop not go down, nor enter his house, to take anything out, ^1315

and let the one who is in the field not turn back to take his cloak. ^1316

And alas for women who are pregnant and for those who are nursing infants in those days! ^1317

Pray that it may not happen in winter. ^1318

For in those days there will be such tribulation as has not been from the beginning of the creation that God created until now, and never will be. ^1319

And if the Lord had not cut short the days, no human being would be saved. But for the sake of the elect, whom he chose, he shortened the days. ^1320

And then if anyone says to you, 'Look, here is the Christ!' or 'Look, there he is!' do not believe it. ^1321

False christs and false prophets will arise and perform signs and wonders, to lead astray, if possible, the elect. ^1322

But be on guard; I have told you all things beforehand. ^1323

But in those days, after that tribulation, the sun will be darkened, and the moon will not give its light, ^1324

and the stars will be falling from heaven, and the powers in the heavens will be shaken. ^1325

And then they will see the Son of Man coming in clouds with great power and glory. ^1326

And then he will send out the angels and gather his elect from the four winds, from the ends of the earth to the ends of heaven. ^1327

From the fig tree learn its lesson: as soon as its branch becomes tender and puts out its leaves, you know that summer is near. ^1328

So also, when you see these things taking place, you know that he is near, at the very gates. ^1329

Truly, I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place. ^1330

Heaven and earth will pass away, but my words will not pass away. ^1331

But concerning that day or that hour, no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father. ^1332

Be on guard, keep awake. For you do not know when the time will come. ^1333

It is like a man going on a journey, when he leaves home and puts his servants in charge, each with his work, and commands the doorkeeper to stay awake. ^1334

Therefore stay awake--for you do not know when the master of the house will come, in the evening, or at midnight, or when the cock crows, or in the morning-- ^1335

lest he come suddenly and find you asleep. ^1336

And what I say to you I say to all: Stay awake. ^1337


It was now two days before the Passover and the Feast of Unleavened Bread. And the chief priests and the scribes were seeking how to arrest him by stealth and kill him, ^1401

for they said, Not during the feast, lest there be an uproar from the people. ^1402

And while he was at Bethany in the house of Simon the leper, as he was reclining at table, a woman came with an alabaster flask of ointment of pure nard, very costly, and she broke the flask and poured it over his head. ^1403

There were some who said to themselves indignantly, Why was the ointment wasted like that? ^1404

For this ointment could have been sold for more than three hundred denarii and given to the poor. And they scolded her. ^1405

But Jesus said, Leave her alone. Why do you trouble her? She has done a beautiful thing to me. ^1406

For you always have the poor with you, and whenever you want, you can do good for them. But you will not always have me. ^1407

She has done what she could; she has anointed my body beforehand for burial. ^1408

And truly, I say to you, wherever the gospel is proclaimed in the whole world, what she has done will be told in memory of her. ^1409

Then Judas Iscariot, who was one of the twelve, went to the chief priests in order to betray him to them. ^1410

And when they heard it, they were glad and promised to give him money. And he sought an opportunity to betray him. ^1411

And on the first day of Unleavened Bread, when they sacrificed the Passover lamb, his disciples said to him, Where will you have us go and prepare for you to eat the Passover? ^1412

And he sent two of his disciples and said to them, Go into the city, and a man carrying a jar of water will meet you. Follow him, ^1413

and wherever he enters, say to the master of the house, 'The Teacher says, Where is my guest room, where I may eat the Passover with my disciples?' ^1414

And he will show you a large upper room furnished and ready; there prepare for us. ^1415

And the disciples set out and went to the city and found it just as he had told them, and they prepared the Passover. ^1416

And when it was evening, he came with the twelve. ^1417

And as they were reclining at table and eating, Jesus said, Truly, I say to you, one of you will betray me, one who is eating with me. ^1418

They began to be sorrowful and to say to him one after another, Is it I? ^1419

He said to them, It is one of the twelve, one who is dipping bread into the dish with me. ^1420

For the Son of Man goes as it is written of him, but woe to that man by whom the Son of Man is betrayed! It would have been better for that man if he had not been born. ^1421

And as they were eating, he took bread, and after blessing it broke it and gave it to them, and said, Take; this is my body. ^1422

And he took a cup, and when he had given thanks he gave it to them, and they all drank of it. ^1423

And he said to them, This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many. ^1424

Truly, I say to you, I will not drink again of the fruit of the vine until that day when I drink it new in the kingdom of God. ^1425

And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives. ^1426

And Jesus said to them, You will all fall away, for it is written, 'I will strike the shepherd, and the sheep will be scattered.' ^1427

But after I am raised up, I will go before you to Galilee. ^1428

Peter said to him, Even though they all fall away, I will not. ^1429

And Jesus said to him, Truly, I tell you, this very night, before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times. ^1430

But he said emphatically, If I must die with you, I will not deny you. And they all said the same. ^1431

And they went to a place called Gethsemane. And he said to his disciples, Sit here while I pray. ^1432

And he took with him Peter and James and John, and began to be greatly distressed and troubled. ^1433

And he said to them, My soul is very sorrowful, even to death. Remain here and watch. ^1434

And going a little farther, he fell on the ground and prayed that, if it were possible, the hour might pass from him. ^1435

And he said, Abba, Father, all things are possible for you. Remove this cup from me. Yet not what I will, but what you will. ^1436

And he came and found them sleeping, and he said to Peter, Simon, are you asleep? Could you not watch one hour? ^1437

Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. ^1438

And again he went away and prayed, saying the same words. ^1439

And again he came and found them sleeping, for their eyes were very heavy, and they did not know what to answer him. ^1440

And he came the third time and said to them, Are you still sleeping and taking your rest? It is enough; the hour has come. The Son of Man is betrayed into the hands of sinners. ^1441

Rise, let us be going; see, my betrayer is at hand. ^1442

And immediately, while he was still speaking, Judas came, one of the twelve, and with him a crowd with swords and clubs, from the chief priests and the scribes and the elders. ^1443

Now the betrayer had given them a sign, saying, The one I will kiss is the man. Seize him and lead him away under guard. ^1444

And when he came, he went up to him at once and said, Rabbi! And he kissed him. ^1445

And they laid hands on him and seized him. ^1446

But one of those who stood by drew his sword and struck the servant of the high priest and cut off his ear. ^1447

And Jesus said to them, Have you come out as against a robber, with swords and clubs to capture me? ^1448

Day after day I was with you in the temple teaching, and you did not seize me. But let the Scriptures be fulfilled. ^1449

And they all left him and fled. ^1450

And a young man followed him, with nothing but a linen cloth about his body. And they seized him, ^1451

but he left the linen cloth and ran away naked. ^1452

And they led Jesus to the high priest. And all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes came together. ^1453

And Peter had followed him at a distance, right into the courtyard of the high priest. And he was sitting with the guards and warming himself at the fire. ^1454

Now the chief priests and the whole Council were seeking testimony against Jesus to put him to death, but they found none. ^1455

For many bore false witness against him, but their testimony did not agree. ^1456

And some stood up and bore false witness against him, saying, ^1457

We heard him say, 'I will destroy this temple that is made with hands, and in three days I will build another, not made with hands.' ^1458

Yet even about this their testimony did not agree. ^1459

And the high priest stood up in the midst and asked Jesus, Have you no answer to make? What is it that these men testify against you? ^1460

But he remained silent and made no answer. Again the high priest asked him, Are you the Christ, the Son of the Blessed? ^1461

And Jesus said, I am, and you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of Power, and coming with the clouds of heaven. ^1462

And the high priest tore his garments and said, What further witnesses do we need? ^1463

You have heard his blasphemy. What is your decision? And they all condemned him as deserving death. ^1464

And some began to spit on him and to cover his face and to strike him, saying to him, Prophesy! And the guards received him with blows. ^1465

And as Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls of the high priest came, ^1466

and seeing Peter warming himself, she looked at him and said, You also were with the Nazarene, Jesus. ^1467

But he denied it, saying, I neither know nor understand what you mean. And he went out into the gateway and the rooster crowed. ^1468

And the servant girl saw him and began again to say to the bystanders, This man is one of them. ^1469

But again he denied it. And after a little while the bystanders again said to Peter, Certainly you are one of them, for you are a Galilean. ^1470

But he began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear, I do not know this man of whom you speak. ^1471

And immediately the rooster crowed a second time. And Peter remembered how Jesus had said to him, Before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times. And he broke down and wept. ^1472


And as soon as it was morning, the chief priests held a consultation with the elders and scribes and the whole Council. And they bound Jesus and led him away and delivered him over to Pilate. ^1501

And Pilate asked him, Are you the King of the Jews? And he answered him, You have said so. ^1502

And the chief priests accused him of many things. ^1503

And Pilate again asked him, Have you no answer to make? See how many charges they bring against you. ^1504

But Jesus made no further answer, so that Pilate was amazed. ^1505

Now at the feast he used to release for them one prisoner for whom they asked. ^1506

And among the rebels in prison, who had committed murder in the insurrection, there was a man called Barabbas. ^1507

And the crowd came up and began to ask Pilate to do as he usually did for them. ^1508

And he answered them, saying, Do you want me to release for you the King of the Jews? ^1509

For he perceived that it was out of envy that the chief priests had delivered him up. ^1510

But the chief priests stirred up the crowd to have him release for them Barabbas instead. ^1511

And Pilate again said to them, Then what shall I do with the man you call the King of the Jews? ^1512

And they cried out again, Crucify him. ^1513

And Pilate said to them, Why, what evil has he done? But they shouted all the more, Crucify him. ^1514

So Pilate, wishing to satisfy the crowd, released for them Barabbas, and having scourged Jesus, he delivered him to be crucified. ^1515

And the soldiers led him away inside the palace (that is, the governor's headquarters), and they called together the whole battalion. ^1516

And they clothed him in a purple cloak, and twisting together a crown of thorns, they put it on him. ^1517

And they began to salute him, Hail, King of the Jews! ^1518

And they were striking his head with a reed and spitting on him and kneeling down in homage to him. ^1519

And when they had mocked him, they stripped him of the purple cloak and put his own clothes on him. And they led him out to crucify him. ^1520

And they compelled a passerby, Simon of Cyrene, who was coming in from the country, the father of Alexander and Rufus, to carry his cross. ^1521

And they brought him to the place called Golgotha (which means Place of a Skull). ^1522

And they offered him wine mixed with myrrh, but he did not take it. ^1523

And they crucified him and divided his garments among them, casting lots for them, to decide what each should take. ^1524

And it was the third hour when they crucified him. ^1525

And the inscription of the charge against him read, The King of the Jews. ^1526

And with him they crucified two robbers, one on his right and one on his left. ^1527

See Footnote ^1528

And those who passed by derided him, wagging their heads and saying, Aha! You who would destroy the temple and rebuild it in three days, ^1529

save yourself, and come down from the cross! ^1530

So also the chief priests with the scribes mocked him to one another, saying, He saved others; he cannot save himself. ^1531

Let the Christ, the King of Israel, come down now from the cross that we may see and believe. Those who were crucified with him also reviled him. ^1532

And when the sixth hour had come, there was darkness over the whole land until the ninth hour. ^1533

And at the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, Eloi, Eloi, lema sabachthani? which means, My God, my God, why have you forsaken me? ^1534

And some of the bystanders hearing it said, Behold, he is calling Elijah. ^1535

And someone ran and filled a sponge with sour wine, put it on a reed and gave it to him to drink, saying, Wait, let us see whether Elijah will come to take him down. ^1536

And Jesus uttered a loud cry and breathed his last. ^1537

And the curtain of the temple was torn in two, from top to bottom. ^1538

And when the centurion, who stood facing him, saw that in this way he breathed his last, he said, Truly this man was the Son of God! ^1539

There were also women looking on from a distance, among whom were Mary Magdalene, and Mary the mother of James the younger and of Joses, and Salome. ^1540

When he was in Galilee, they followed him and ministered to him, and there were also many other women who came up with him to Jerusalem. ^1541

And when evening had come, since it was the day of Preparation, that is, the day before the Sabbath, ^1542

Joseph of Arimathea, a respected member of the Council, who was also himself looking for the kingdom of God, took courage and went to Pilate and asked for the body of Jesus. ^1543

Pilate was surprised to hear that he should have already died. And summoning the centurion, he asked him whether he was already dead. ^1544

And when he learned from the centurion that he was dead, he granted the corpse to Joseph. ^1545

And Joseph bought a linen shroud, and taking him down, wrapped him in the linen shroud and laid him in a tomb that had been cut out of the rock. And he rolled a stone against the entrance of the tomb. ^1546

Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of Joses saw where he was laid. ^1547


When the Sabbath was past, Mary Magdalene and Mary the mother of James and Salome bought spices, so that they might go and anoint him. ^1601

And very early on the first day of the week, when the sun had risen, they went to the tomb. ^1602

And they were saying to one another, Who will roll away the stone for us from the entrance of the tomb? ^1603

And looking up, they saw that the stone had been rolled back--it was very large. ^1604

And entering the tomb, they saw a young man sitting on the right side, dressed in a white robe, and they were alarmed. ^1605

And he said to them, Do not be alarmed. You seek Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified. He has risen; he is not here. See the place where they laid him. ^1606

But go, tell his disciples and Peter that he is going before you to Galilee. There you will see him, just as he told you. ^1607

And they went out and fled from the tomb, for trembling and astonishment had seized them, and they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid. ⟨Some of the earliest manuscripts do not include 16:9-20.⟩ ^1608

⟨⟨Now when he rose early on the first day of the week, he appeared first to Mary Magdalene, from whom he had cast out seven demons. ^1609

She went and told those who had been with him, as they mourned and wept. ^1610

But when they heard that he was alive and had been seen by her, they would not believe it. ^1611

After these things he appeared in another form to two of them, as they were walking into the country. ^1612

And they went back and told the rest, but they did not believe them. ^1613

Afterward he appeared to the eleven themselves as they were reclining at table, and he rebuked them for their unbelief and hardness of heart, because they had not believed those who saw him after he had risen. ^1614

And he said to them, Go into all the world and proclaim the gospel to the whole creation. ^1615

Whoever believes and is baptized will be saved, but whoever does not believe will be condemned. ^1616

And these signs will accompany those who believe: in my name they will cast out demons; they will speak in new tongues; ^1617

they will pick up serpents with their hands; and if they drink any deadly poison, it will not hurt them; they will lay their hands on the sick, and they will recover. ^1618

So then the Lord Jesus, after he had spoken to them, was taken up into heaven and sat down at the right hand of God. ^1619

And they went out and preached everywhere, while the Lord worked with them and confirmed the message by accompanying signs.⟩⟩ ^1620
