⟨This is⟩ [[H1697|the word]] [[H3068|of the LORD]] [[H834|that]] [[H1961|came]] [[H413|to]] [[H1954|Hosea]] [[H1121|son]] [[H882|of Beeri]] [[H3117|in the days]] [[H5818|of Uzziah,]] [[H3147|Jotham,]] [[H271|Ahaz,]] [[H2396|and Hezekiah,]] [[H4428|kings]] [[H3063|of Judah,]] [[H3117|and]] ⟨of⟩ [[H3379|Jeroboam]] [[H1121|son]] [[H3101|of Jehoash,]] [[H4428|king]] [[H3478|of Israel.]] ^0101

[[H3068|When the LORD]] [[H8462|first]] [[H1696|spoke]] [[H1954|to Hosea,]] [[H3068|He]] [[H559|told]] [[H1954|him,]] [[H1980|“Go,]] [[H3947|take]] [[H2183|a prostitute]] [[H802|as your  wife]] [[H3206|and have children]] [[H2183|of adultery,]] [[H3588|because]] [[H776|this land]] [[H2181|is flagrantly prostituting itself]] ⟨by departing⟩ [[H310|from]] [[H3068|the LORD.”]] ^0102

[[H1980|So went]] ⟨Hosea⟩ [[H3947|and married]] [[H1586|Gomer]] [[H1323|daughter]] [[H1691|of Diblaim,]] [[H2029|and she conceived]] [[H3205|and bore]] [[H1121|him  a son.]] ^0103

[[H3068|Then the LORD]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] ⟨Hosea⟩, [[H7121|“Name]] [[H3157|him Jezreel,]] [[H3588|for]] [[H5750|soon]] [[H6485|I will bring]] [[H1818|the bloodshed]] [[H3157|of Jezreel]] [[H5921|upon]] [[H1004|the house]] [[H3058|of Jehu,]] [[H7673|and I will put an end]] [[H4468|to the kingdom]] [[H3478|of Israel.]] ^0104

[[H559|And the LORD said,]] [[H7121|“Name]] [[H8034|him]] [[H3818|Lo-ammi,]] [[H3588|for]] [[H859|you]] [[H3808|are not]] [[H5971|My people,]] [[H595|and I]] [[H3808|am not]] [[H1961|your God.]] ^0109

[[H4557|Yet the number]] [[H1121|of the Israelites]] [[H1961|will be]] [[H2344|like the sand]] [[H3220|of the sea,]] [[H834|which]] [[H3808|cannot]] [[H4058|be measured]] ⟨or⟩ [[H3808|]] [[H5608|numbered.]] [[H1961|And]] [[H4725|in the place]] [[H834|where]] [[H559|it was said]] [[H1992|to them,]] [[H859|‘You]] ⟨are⟩ [[H3808|not]] [[H5971|My people,’]] [[H559|they will be called]] [[H1121|‘sons]] [[H2416|of the living]] [[H410|God.’]] ^0110

[[H6485|I will punish]] [[H5921|her]] [[H3117|for the days]] [[H1168|of the Baals]] [[H834|when]] [[H6999|she burned incense to them,]] [[H5710|when she decked herself]] [[H5141|with rings]] [[H2484|and jewelry,]] [[H1980|and went]] [[H310|after]] [[H157|her lovers.]] [[H853|But Me]] [[H7911|she forgot,”]] [[H5002|declares]] [[H3068|the LORD.]] ^0213

[[H1931|On that]] [[H3117|day]] [[H3772|I will make]] [[H1285|a covenant]] [[H5973|for them  with]] [[H2416|the beasts]] [[H7704|of the field]] ⟨and⟩ [[H5973|]] [[H5775|the birds]] [[H8064|of the air]] [[H7431|and the creatures that crawl]] [[H127|on the ground.]] [[H7665|And I will abolish]] [[H7198|bow]] [[H2719|and sword]] [[H4421|and weapons of war]] [[H4480|in]] [[H776|the land,]] [[H7901|and will make them lie down]] [[H983|in safety.]] ^0218

[[H3068|Then the LORD]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to me,]] [[H1980|“Go]] [[H157|show love]] [[H802|to your wife]] [[H5750|again,]] [[H157|though she is loved]] [[H7453|by another]] [[H5003|and is an adulteress.]] ⟨Love her⟩ [[H160|]] [[H3068|as the LORD]] [[H157|loves]] [[H1121|the Israelites,]] [[H1992|though they]] [[H6437|turn]] [[H413|to]] [[H312|other]] [[H430|gods]] ⟨and offer⟩ [[H809|cakes]] [[H6025|of raisin.]] ^0301

[[H4611|Their deeds]] [[H3808|do not]] [[H5414|permit them]] [[H7725|to return]] [[H413|to]] [[H430|their God,]] [[H3588|for]] [[H7307|a spirit]] [[H2183|of prostitution]] [[H7130|is within them,]] [[H3808|and they do not]] [[H3045|know]] [[H3068|the LORD.]] ^0504

[[H3478|Israel’s]] [[H1347|arrogance]] [[H6030|testifies]] [[H6440|against them;]] [[H3478|both Israel]] [[H669|and Ephraim]] [[H3782|stumble]] [[H5771|in their iniquity;]] [[H1571|even]] [[H3063|Judah]] [[H3782|stumbles]] [[H5973|with them.]] ^0505

[[H1980|They go]] [[H6629|with their flocks]] [[H1241|and herds]] [[H1245|to seek]] [[H3068|the LORD,]] [[H3808|but they do not]] [[H4672|find Him;]] [[H2502|He has withdrawn Himself]] [[H1992|from them.]] ^0506

[[H8269|The princes]] [[H3063|of Judah]] [[H1961|are like those]] [[H5253|who move]] [[H1366|boundary stones;]] [[H8210|I will pour out]] [[H5678|My fury]] [[H5921|upon them]] [[H4325|like water.]] ^0510

[[H669|When Ephraim]] [[H7200|saw]] [[H2483|his sickness]] [[H3063|and Judah]] [[H4205|his wound,]] [[H669|then Ephraim]] [[H1980|turned]] [[H413|to]] [[H804|Assyria]] [[H7971|and sent]] [[H413|to]] [[H3377|the great]] [[H4428|king.]] [[H1931|But he]] [[H3808|cannot]] [[H7495|cure]] [[H3808|you]] ⟨or⟩ [[H1455|heal]] [[H4205|your wound.]] ^0513

[[H3045|So let us know—]] [[H7291|let us press]] [[H3045|on to know]] [[H3068|the LORD.]] [[H3559|As surely as]] [[H7837|the sun rises,]] [[H4161|He will appear;]] [[H935|He will come]] [[H1653|to us  like the rain,]] [[H4456|like the spring showers]] [[H3138|that water]] [[H776|the earth.]] ^0603

[[H3605|They are all]] [[H5003|adulterers,]] [[H3644|like]] [[H8574|an oven]] [[H1197|heated]] [[H644|by a baker]] [[H7673|who needs not]] [[H5782|stoke the fire]] [[H3888|from the kneading]] [[H5704|to]] [[H2556|the rising]] [[H1217|of the dough.]] ^0704

[[H8269|The princes]] [[H2470|are inflamed]] [[H3196|with wine]] [[H3117|on the day]] [[H4428|of our king;]] [[H4900|so he joins hands]] [[H854|with]] [[H3945|those who mock him.]] ^0705
