In the first book, O Theophilus, I have dealt with all that Jesus began to do and teach, ^0101

until the day when he was taken up, after he had given commands through the Holy Spirit to the apostles whom he had chosen. ^0102

He presented himself alive to them after his suffering by many proofs, appearing to them during forty days and speaking about the kingdom of God. ^0103

And while staying with them he ordered them not to depart from Jerusalem, but to wait for the promise of the Father, which, he said, you heard from me; ^0104

for John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days from now. ^0105

So when they had come together, they asked him, Lord, will you at this time restore the kingdom to Israel? ^0106

He said to them, It is not for you to know times or seasons that the Father has fixed by his own authority. ^0107

But you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and in all Judea and Samaria, and to the end of the earth. ^0108

And when he had said these things, as they were looking on, he was lifted up, and a cloud took him out of their sight. ^0109

And while they were gazing into heaven as he went, behold, two men stood by them in white robes, ^0110

and said, Men of Galilee, why do you stand looking into heaven? This Jesus, who was taken up from you into heaven, will come in the same way as you saw him go into heaven. ^0111

Then they returned to Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is near Jerusalem, a Sabbath day’s journey away. ^0112

And when they had entered, they went up to the upper room, where they were staying, Peter and John and James and Andrew, Philip and Thomas, Bartholomew and Matthew, James the son of Alphaeus and Simon the Zealot and Judas the son of James. ^0113

All these with one accord were devoting themselves to prayer, together with the women and Mary the mother of Jesus, and his brothers. ^0114

In those days Peter stood up among the brothers (the company of persons was in all about 120 ) and said, ^0115

Brothers, the Scripture had to be fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit spoke beforehand by the mouth of David concerning Judas, who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus. ^0116

For he was numbered among us and was allotted his share in this ministry. ^0117

( Now this man acquired a field with the reward of his wickedness, and falling headlong he burst open in the middle and all his bowels gushed out. ^0118

And it became known to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, so that the field was called in their own language Akeldama, that is, Field of Blood .) ^0119

For it is written in the Book of Psalms, May his camp become desolate, and let there be no one to dwell in it; and Let another take his office. ^0120

So one of the men who have accompanied us during all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us, ^0121

beginning from the baptism of John until the day when he was taken up from us — one of these men must become with us a witness to his resurrection. ^0122

And they put forward two, Joseph called Barsabbas, who was also called Justus, and Matthias. ^0123

And they prayed and said, You, Lord, who know the hearts of all, show which one of these two you have chosen ^0124

to take the place in this ministry and apostleship from which Judas turned aside to go to his own place. ^0125

And they cast lots for them, and the lot fell on Matthias, and he was numbered with the eleven apostles. ^0126



When the day of Pentecost arrived, they were all together in one place. ^0201

And suddenly there came from heaven a sound like a mighty rushing wind, and it filled the entire house where they were sitting. ^0202

And divided tongues as of fire appeared to them and rested on each one of them. ^0203

And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak in other tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance. ^0204

Now there were dwelling in Jerusalem Jews, devout men from every nation under heaven. ^0205

And at this sound the multitude came together, and they were bewildered, because each one was hearing them speak in his own language. ^0206

And they were amazed and astonished, saying, Are not all these who are speaking Galileans? ^0207

And how is it that we hear, each of us in his own native language? ^0208

Parthians and Medes and Elamites and residents of Mesopotamia, Judea and Cappadocia, Pontus and Asia, ^0209

Phrygia and Pamphylia, Egypt and the parts of Libya belonging to Cyrene, and visitors from Rome, ^0210

both Jews and proselytes, Cretans and Arabians —we hear them telling in our own tongues the mighty works of God. ^0211

And all were amazed and perplexed, saying to one another, What does this mean? ^0212

But others mocking said, They are filled with new wine. ^0213

But Peter, standing with the eleven, lifted up his voice and addressed them : Men of Judea and all who dwell in Jerusalem, let this be known to you, and give ear to my words. ^0214

For these people are not drunk, as you suppose, since it is only the third hour of the day. ^0215

But this is what was uttered through the prophet Joel : ^0216

And in the last days it shall be, God declares, that I will pour out my Spirit on all flesh, and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams; ^0217

even on my male servants and female servants in those days I will pour out my Spirit, and they shall prophesy. ^0218

And I will show wonders in the heavens above and signs on the earth below, blood, and fire, and vapor of smoke; ^0219

the sun shall be turned to darkness and the moon to blood, before the day of the Lord comes, the great and magnificent day. ^0220

And it shall come to pass that everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. ^0221

Men of Israel, hear these words : Jesus of Nazareth, a man attested to you by God with mighty works and wonders and signs that God did through him in your midst, as you yourselves know — ^0222

this Jesus, delivered up according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God, you crucified and killed by the hands of lawless men. ^0223

God raised him up, loosing the pangs of death, because it was not possible for him to be held by it. ^0224

For David says concerning him, I saw the Lord always before me, for he is at my right hand that I may not be shaken; ^0225

therefore my heart was glad, and my tongue rejoiced; my flesh also will dwell in hope. ^0226

For you will not abandon my soul to Hades, or let your Holy One see corruption. ^0227

You have made known to me the paths of life; you will make me full of gladness with your presence. ^0228

Brothers, I may say to you with confidence about the patriarch David that he both died and was buried, and his tomb is with us to this day. ^0229

Being therefore a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him that he would set one of his descendants on his throne, ^0230

he foresaw and spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that he was not abandoned to Hades, nor did his flesh see corruption. ^0231

This Jesus God raised up, and of that we all are witnesses. ^0232

Being therefore exalted at the right hand of God, and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he has poured out this that you yourselves are seeing and hearing. ^0233

For David did not ascend into the heavens, but he himself says, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand, ^0234

until I make your enemies your footstool. ^0235

Let all the house of Israel therefore know for certain that God has made him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified. ^0236

Now when they heard this they were cut to the heart, and said to Peter and the rest of the apostles, Brothers, what shall we do? ^0237

And Peter said to them, Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. ^0238

For the promise is for you and for your children and for all who are far off, everyone whom the Lord our God calls to himself. ^0239

And with many other words he bore witness and continued to exhort them, saying, Save yourselves from this crooked generation. ^0240

So those who received his word were baptized, and there were added that day about three thousand souls. ^0241

And they devoted themselves to the apostles ’ teaching and the fellowship, to the breaking of bread and the prayers. ^0242

And awe came upon every soul, and many wonders and signs were being done through the apostles. ^0243

And all who believed were together and had all things in common. ^0244

And they were selling their possessions and belongings and distributing the proceeds to all, as any had need. ^0245

And day by day, attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes, they received their food with glad and generous hearts, ^0246

praising God and having favor with all the people. And the Lord added to their number day by day those who were being saved. ^0247



Now Peter and John were going up to the temple at the hour of prayer, the ninth hour. ^0301

And a man lame from birth was being carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple that is called the Beautiful Gate to ask alms of those entering the temple. ^0302

Seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple, he asked to receive alms. ^0303

And Peter directed his gaze at him, as did John, and said, Look at us. ^0304

And he fixed his attention on them, expecting to receive something from them. ^0305

But Peter said, I have no silver and gold, but what I do have I give to you. In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, rise up and walk! ^0306

And he took him by the right hand and raised him up, and immediately his feet and ankles were made strong. ^0307

And leaping up he stood and began to walk, and entered the temple with them, walking and leaping and praising God. ^0308

And all the people saw him walking and praising God, ^0309

and recognized him as the one who sat at the Beautiful Gate of the temple, asking for alms. And they were filled with wonder and amazement at what had happened to him. ^0310

While he clung to Peter and John, all the people, utterly astounded, ran together to them in the portico called Solomon’s. ^0311

And when Peter saw it he addressed the people : Men of Israel, why do you wonder at this, or why do you stare at us, as though by our own power or piety we have made him walk? ^0312

The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, the God of our fathers, glorified his servant Jesus, whom you delivered over and denied in the presence of Pilate, when he had decided to release him. ^0313

But you denied the Holy and Righteous One, and asked for a murderer to be granted to you, ^0314

and you killed the Author of life, whom God raised from the dead. To this we are witnesses. ^0315

And his name — by faith in his name —has made this man strong whom you see and know, and the faith that is through Jesus has given the man this perfect health in the presence of you all. ^0316

And now, brothers, I know that you acted in ignorance, as did also your rulers. ^0317

But what God foretold by the mouth of all the prophets, that his Christ would suffer, he thus fulfilled. ^0318

Repent therefore, and turn back, that your sins may be blotted out, ^0319

that times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord, and that he may send the Christ appointed for you, Jesus, ^0320

whom heaven must receive until the time for restoring all the things about which God spoke by the mouth of his holy prophets long ago. ^0321

Moses said, The Lord God will raise up for you a prophet like me from your brothers. You shall listen to him in whatever he tells you. ^0322

And it shall be that every soul who does not listen to that prophet shall be destroyed from the people. ^0323

And all the prophets who have spoken, from Samuel and those who came after him, also proclaimed these days. ^0324

You are the sons of the prophets and of the covenant that God made with your fathers, saying to Abraham, And in your offspring shall all the families of the earth be blessed. ^0325

God, having raised up his servant, sent him to you first, to bless you by turning every one of you from your wickedness. ^0326



And as they were speaking to the people, the priests and the captain of the temple and the Sadducees came upon them, ^0401

greatly annoyed because they were teaching the people and proclaiming in Jesus the resurrection from the dead. ^0402

And they arrested them and put them in custody until the next day, for it was already evening. ^0403

But many of those who had heard the word believed, and the number of the men came to about five thousand. ^0404

On the next day their rulers and elders and scribes gathered together in Jerusalem, ^0405

with Annas the high priest and Caiaphas and John and Alexander, and all who were of the high-priestly family. ^0406

And when they had set them in the midst, they inquired, By what power or by what name did you do this? ^0407

Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said to them, Rulers of the people and elders, ^0408

if we are being examined today concerning a good deed done to a crippled man, by what means this man has been healed, ^0409

let it be known to all of you and to all the people of Israel that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead — by him this man is standing before you well. ^0410

This Jesus is the stone that was rejected by you, the builders, which has become the cornerstone. ^0411

And there is salvation in no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men by which we must be saved. ^0412

Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were uneducated, common men, they were astonished. And they recognized that they had been with Jesus. ^0413

But seeing the man who was healed standing beside them, they had nothing to say in opposition. ^0414

But when they had commanded them to leave the council, they conferred with one another, ^0415

saying, What shall we do with these men? For that a notable sign has been performed through them is evident to all the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and we cannot deny it. ^0416

But in order that it may spread no further among the people, let us warn them to speak no more to anyone in this name. ^0417

So they called them and charged them not to speak or teach at all in the name of Jesus. ^0418

But Peter and John answered them, Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen to you rather than to God, you must judge, ^0419

for we cannot but speak of what we have seen and heard. ^0420

And when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding no way to punish them, because of the people, for all were praising God for what had happened. ^0421

For the man on whom this sign of healing was performed was more than forty years old. ^0422

When they were released, they went to their friends and reported what the chief priests and the elders had said to them. ^0423

And when they heard it, they lifted their voices together to God and said, Sovereign Lord, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and everything in them, ^0424

who through the mouth of our father David, your servant, said by the Holy Spirit, Why did the Gentiles rage, and the peoples plot in vain? ^0425

The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers were gathered together, against the Lord and against his Anointed — ^0426

for truly in this city there were gathered together against your holy servant Jesus, whom you anointed, both Herod and Pontius Pilate, along with the Gentiles and the peoples of Israel, ^0427

to do whatever your hand and your plan had predestined to take place. ^0428

And now, Lord, look upon their threats and grant to your servants to continue to speak your word with all boldness, ^0429

while you stretch out your hand to heal, and signs and wonders are performed through the name of your holy servant Jesus. ^0430

And when they had prayed, the place in which they were gathered together was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and continued to speak the word of God with boldness. ^0431

Now the full number of those who believed were of one heart and soul, and no one said that any of the things that belonged to him was his own, but they had everything in common. ^0432

And with great power the apostles were giving their testimony to the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, and great grace was upon them all. ^0433

There was not a needy person among them, for as many as were owners of lands or houses sold them and brought the proceeds of what was sold ^0434

and laid it at the apostles ’ feet, and it was distributed to each as any had need. ^0435

Thus Joseph, who was also called by the apostles Barnabas (which means son of encouragement ), a Levite, a native of Cyprus, ^0436

sold a field that belonged to him and brought the money and laid it at the apostles ’ feet. ^0437



But a man named Ananias, with his wife Sapphira, sold a piece of property, ^0501

and with his wife’s knowledge he kept back for himself some of the proceeds and brought only a part of it and laid it at the apostles ’ feet. ^0502

But Peter said, Ananias, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit and to keep back for yourself part of the proceeds of the land? ^0503

While it remained unsold, did it not remain your own? And after it was sold, was it not at your disposal? Why is it that you have contrived this deed in your heart? You have not lied to man but to God. ^0504

When Ananias heard these words, he fell down and breathed his last. And great fear came upon all who heard of it. ^0505

The young men rose and wrapped him up and carried him out and buried him. ^0506

After an interval of about three hours his wife came in, not knowing what had happened. ^0507

And Peter said to her, Tell me whether you sold the land for so much. And she said, Yes, for so much. ^0508

But Peter said to her, How is it that you have agreed together to test the Spirit of the Lord? Behold, the feet of those who have buried your husband are at the door, and they will carry you out. ^0509

Immediately she fell down at his feet and breathed her last. When the young men came in they found her dead, and they carried her out and buried her beside her husband. ^0510

And great fear came upon the whole church and upon all who heard of these things. ^0511

Now many signs and wonders were regularly done among the people by the hands of the apostles. And they were all together in Solomon’s Portico. ^0512

None of the rest dared join them, but the people held them in high esteem. ^0513

And more than ever believers were added to the Lord, multitudes of both men and women, ^0514

so that they even carried out the sick into the streets and laid them on cots and mats, that as Peter came by at least his shadow might fall on some of them. ^0515

The people also gathered from the towns around Jerusalem, bringing the sick and those afflicted with unclean spirits, and they were all healed. ^0516

But the high priest rose up, and all who were with him (that is, the party of the Sadducees ), and filled with jealousy ^0517

they arrested the apostles and put them in the public prison. ^0518

But during the night an angel of the Lord opened the prison doors and brought them out, and said, ^0519

Go and stand in the temple and speak to the people all the words of this Life. ^0520

And when they heard this, they entered the temple at daybreak and began to teach. Now when the high priest came, and those who were with him, they called together the council, all the senate of the people of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought. ^0521

But when the officers came, they did not find them in the prison, so they returned and reported, ^0522

We found the prison securely locked and the guards standing at the doors, but when we opened them we found no one inside. ^0523

Now when the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these words, they were greatly perplexed about them, wondering what this would come to. ^0524

And someone came and told them, Look! The men whom you put in prison are standing in the temple and teaching the people. ^0525

Then the captain with the officers went and brought them, but not by force, for they were afraid of being stoned by the people. ^0526

And when they had brought them, they set them before the council. And the high priest questioned them, ^0527

saying, We strictly charged you not to teach in this name, yet here you have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and you intend to bring this man’s blood upon us. ^0528

But Peter and the apostles answered, We must obey God rather than men. ^0529

The God of our fathers raised Jesus, whom you killed by hanging him on a tree. ^0530

God exalted him at his right hand as Leader and Savior, to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins. ^0531

And we are witnesses to these things, and so is the Holy Spirit, whom God has given to those who obey him. ^0532

When they heard this, they were enraged and wanted to kill them. ^0533

But a Pharisee in the council named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law held in honor by all the people, stood up and gave orders to put the men outside for a little while. ^0534

And he said to them, Men of Israel, take care what you are about to do with these men. ^0535

For before these days Theudas rose up, claiming to be somebody, and a number of men, about four hundred, joined him. He was killed, and all who followed him were dispersed and came to nothing. ^0536

After him Judas the Galilean rose up in the days of the census and drew away some of the people after him. He too perished, and all who followed him were scattered. ^0537

So in the present case I tell you, keep away from these men and let them alone, for if this plan or this undertaking is of man, it will fail; ^0538

but if it is of God, you will not be able to overthrow them. You might even be found opposing God! So they took his advice, ^0539

and when they had called in the apostles, they beat them and charged them not to speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go. ^0540

Then they left the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor for the name. ^0541

And every day, in the temple and from house to house, they did not cease teaching and preaching that the Christ is Jesus. ^0542



Now in these days when the disciples were increasing in number, a complaint by the Hellenists arose against the Hebrews because their widows were being neglected in the daily distribution. ^0601

And the twelve summoned the full number of the disciples and said, It is not right that we should give up preaching the word of God to serve tables. ^0602

Therefore, brothers, pick out from among you seven men of good repute, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we will appoint to this duty. ^0603

But we will devote ourselves to prayer and to the ministry of the word. ^0604

And what they said pleased the whole gathering, and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolaus, a proselyte of Antioch. ^0605

These they set before the apostles, and they prayed and laid their hands on them. ^0606

And the word of God continued to increase, and the number of the disciples multiplied greatly in Jerusalem, and a great many of the priests became obedient to the faith. ^0607

And Stephen, full of grace and power, was doing great wonders and signs among the people. ^0608

Then some of those who belonged to the synagogue of the Freedmen (as it was called ), and of the Cyrenians, and of the Alexandrians, and of those from Cilicia and Asia, rose up and disputed with Stephen. ^0609

But they could not withstand the wisdom and the Spirit with which he was speaking. ^0610

Then they secretly instigated men who said, We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses and God. ^0611

And they stirred up the people and the elders and the scribes, and they came upon him and seized him and brought him before the council, ^0612

and they set up false witnesses who said, This man never ceases to speak words against this holy place and the law, ^0613

for we have heard him say that this Jesus of Nazareth will destroy this place and will change the customs that Moses delivered to us. ^0614

And gazing at him, all who sat in the council saw that his face was like the face of an angel. ^0615



And the high priest said, Are these things so? ^0701

And Stephen said : Brothers and fathers, hear me. The God of glory appeared to our father Abraham when he was in Mesopotamia, before he lived in Haran, ^0702

and said to him, Go out from your land and from your kindred and go into the land that I will show you. ^0703

Then he went out from the land of the Chaldeans and lived in Haran. And after his father died, God removed him from there into this land in which you are now living. ^0704

Yet he gave him no inheritance in it, not even a foot’s length, but promised to give it to him as a possession and to his offspring after him, though he had no child. ^0705

And God spoke to this effect— that his offspring would be sojourners in a land belonging to others, who would enslave them and afflict them four hundred years. ^0706

But I will judge the nation that they serve, said God, and after that they shall come out and worship me in this place. ^0707

And he gave him the covenant of circumcision. And so Abraham became the father of Isaac, and circumcised him on the eighth day, and Isaac became the father of Jacob, and Jacob of the twelve patriarchs. ^0708

And the patriarchs, jealous of Joseph, sold him into Egypt; but God was with him ^0709

and rescued him out of all his afflictions and gave him favor and wisdom before Pharaoh, king of Egypt, who made him ruler over Egypt and over all his household. ^0710

Now there came a famine throughout all Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction, and our fathers could find no food. ^0711

But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent out our fathers on their first visit. ^0712

And on the second visit Joseph made himself known to his brothers, and Joseph’s family became known to Pharaoh. ^0713

And Joseph sent and summoned Jacob his father and all his kindred, seventy-five persons in all. ^0714

And Jacob went down into Egypt, and he died, he and our fathers, ^0715

and they were carried back to Shechem and laid in the tomb that Abraham had bought for a sum of silver from the sons of Hamor in Shechem. ^0716

But as the time of the promise drew near, which God had granted to Abraham, the people increased and multiplied in Egypt ^0717

until there arose over Egypt another king who did not know Joseph. ^0718

He dealt shrewdly with our race and forced our fathers to expose their infants, so that they would not be kept alive. ^0719

At this time Moses was born; and he was beautiful in God’s sight. And he was brought up for three months in his father’s house, ^0720

and when he was exposed, Pharaoh’s daughter adopted him and brought him up as her own son. ^0721

And Moses was instructed in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and he was mighty in his words and deeds. ^0722

When he was forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brothers, the children of Israel. ^0723

And seeing one of them being wronged, he defended the oppressed man and avenged him by striking down the Egyptian. ^0724

He supposed that his brothers would understand that God was giving them salvation by his hand, but they did not understand. ^0725

And on the following day he appeared to them as they were quarreling and tried to reconcile them, saying, Men, you are brothers. Why do you wrong each other? ^0726

But the man who was wronging his neighbor thrust him aside, saying, Who made you a ruler and a judge over us? ^0727

Do you want to kill me as you killed the Egyptian yesterday? ^0728

At this retort Moses fled and became an exile in the land of Midian, where he became the father of two sons. ^0729

Now when forty years had passed, an angel appeared to him in the wilderness of Mount Sinai, in a flame of fire in a bush. ^0730

When Moses saw it, he was amazed at the sight, and as he drew near to look, there came the voice of the Lord : ^0731

I am the God of your fathers, the God of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob. And Moses trembled and did not dare to look. ^0732

Then the Lord said to him, Take off the sandals from your feet, for the place where you are standing is holy ground. ^0733

I have surely seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt, and have heard their groaning, and I have come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send you to Egypt. ^0734

This Moses, whom they rejected, saying, Who made you a ruler and a judge? —this man God sent as both ruler and redeemer by the hand of the angel who appeared to him in the bush. ^0735

This man led them out, performing wonders and signs in Egypt and at the Red Sea and in the wilderness for forty years. ^0736

This is the Moses who said to the Israelites, God will raise up for you a prophet like me from your brothers. ^0737

This is the one who was in the congregation in the wilderness with the angel who spoke to him at Mount Sinai, and with our fathers. He received living oracles to give to us. ^0738

Our fathers refused to obey him, but thrust him aside, and in their hearts they turned to Egypt, ^0739

saying to Aaron, Make for us gods who will go before us. As for this Moses who led us out from the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him. ^0740

And they made a calf in those days, and offered a sacrifice to the idol and were rejoicing in the works of their hands. ^0741

But God turned away and gave them over to worship the host of heaven, as it is written in the book of the prophets : Did you bring to me slain beasts and sacrifices, during the forty years in the wilderness, O house of Israel? ^0742

You took up the tent of Moloch and the star of your god Rephan, the images that you made to worship; and I will send you into exile beyond Babylon. ^0743

Our fathers had the tent of witness in the wilderness, just as he who spoke to Moses directed him to make it, according to the pattern that he had seen. ^0744

Our fathers in turn brought it in with Joshua when they dispossessed the nations that God drove out before our fathers. So it was until the days of David, ^0745

who found favor in the sight of God and asked to find a dwelling place for the God of Jacob. ^0746

But it was Solomon who built a house for him. ^0747

Yet the Most High does not dwell in houses made by hands, as the prophet says, ^0748

Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool. What kind of house will you build for me, says the Lord, or what is the place of my rest? ^0749

Did not my hand make all these things? ^0750

You stiff-necked people, uncircumcised in heart and ears, you always resist the Holy Spirit. As your fathers did, so do you. ^0751

Which of the prophets did your fathers not persecute? And they killed those who announced beforehand the coming of the Righteous One, whom you have now betrayed and murdered, ^0752

you who received the law as delivered by angels and did not keep it. ^0753

Now when they heard these things they were enraged, and they ground their teeth at him. ^0754

But he, full of the Holy Spirit, gazed into heaven and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing at the right hand of God. ^0755

And he said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God. ^0756

But they cried out with a loud voice and stopped their ears and rushed together at him. ^0757

Then they cast him out of the city and stoned him. And the witnesses laid down their garments at the feet of a young man named Saul. ^0758

And as they were stoning Stephen, he called out, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit. ^0759

And falling to his knees he cried out with a loud voice, Lord, do not hold this sin against them. And when he had said this, he fell asleep. ^0760



And Saul approved of his execution. And there arose on that day a great persecution against the church in Jerusalem, and they were all scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles. ^0801

Devout men buried Stephen and made great lamentation over him. ^0802

But Saul was ravaging the church, and entering house after house, he dragged off men and women and committed them to prison. ^0803

Now those who were scattered went about preaching the word. ^0804

Philip went down to the city of Samaria and proclaimed to them the Christ. ^0805

And the crowds with one accord paid attention to what was being said by Philip when they heard him and saw the signs that he did. ^0806

For unclean spirits, crying out with a loud voice, came out of many who had them, and many who were paralyzed or lame were healed. ^0807

So there was much joy in that city. ^0808

But there was a man named Simon, who had previously practiced magic in the city and amazed the people of Samaria, saying that he himself was somebody great. ^0809

They all paid attention to him, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the power of God that is called Great. ^0810

And they paid attention to him because for a long time he had amazed them with his magic. ^0811

But when they believed Philip as he preached good news about the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women. ^0812

Even Simon himself believed, and after being baptized he continued with Philip. And seeing signs and great miracles performed, he was amazed. ^0813

Now when the apostles at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent to them Peter and John, ^0814

who came down and prayed for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit, ^0815

for he had not yet fallen on any of them, but they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. ^0816

Then they laid their hands on them and they received the Holy Spirit. ^0817

Now when Simon saw that the Spirit was given through the laying on of the apostles ’ hands, he offered them money, ^0818

saying, Give me this power also, so that anyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit. ^0819

But Peter said to him, May your silver perish with you, because you thought you could obtain the gift of God with money! ^0820

You have neither part nor lot in this matter, for your heart is not right before God. ^0821

Repent, therefore, of this wickedness of yours, and pray to the Lord that, if possible, the intent of your heart may be forgiven you. ^0822

For I see that you are in the gall of bitterness and in the bond of iniquity. ^0823

And Simon answered, Pray for me to the Lord, that nothing of what you have said may come upon me. ^0824

Now when they had testified and spoken the word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem, preaching the gospel to many villages of the Samaritans. ^0825

Now an angel of the Lord said to Philip, Rise and go toward the south to the road that goes down from Jerusalem to Gaza. This is a desert place. ^0826

And he rose and went. And there was an Ethiopian, a eunuch, a court official of Candace, queen of the Ethiopians, who was in charge of all her treasure. He had come to Jerusalem to worship ^0827

and was returning, seated in his chariot, and he was reading the prophet Isaiah. ^0828

And the Spirit said to Philip, Go over and join this chariot. ^0829

So Philip ran to him and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet and asked, Do you understand what you are reading? ^0830

And he said, How can I, unless someone guides me? And he invited Philip to come up and sit with him. ^0831

Now the passage of the Scripture that he was reading was this : Like a sheep he was led to the slaughter and like a lamb before its shearer is silent, so he opens not his mouth. ^0832

In his humiliation justice was denied him. Who can describe his generation? For his life is taken away from the earth. ^0833

And the eunuch said to Philip, About whom, I ask you, does the prophet say this, about himself or about someone else? ^0834

Then Philip opened his mouth, and beginning with this Scripture he told him the good news about Jesus. ^0835

And as they were going along the road they came to some water, and the eunuch said, See, here is water! What prevents me from being baptized? ^0836

And as they were going along the road they came to some water, and the eunuch said, See, here is water! What prevents me from being baptized? ^0837

And he commanded the chariot to stop, and they both went down into the water, Philip and the eunuch, and he baptized him. ^0838

And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord carried Philip away, and the eunuch saw him no more, and went on his way rejoicing. ^0839

But Philip found himself at Azotus, and as he passed through he preached the gospel to all the towns until he came to Caesarea. ^0840



But Saul, still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord, went to the high priest ^0901

and asked him for letters to the synagogues at Damascus, so that if he found any belonging to the Way, men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem. ^0902

Now as he went on his way, he approached Damascus, and suddenly a light from heaven shone around him. ^0903

And falling to the ground he heard a voice saying to him, Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? ^0904

And he said, Who are you, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting. ^0905

But rise and enter the city, and you will be told what you are to do. ^0906

The men who were traveling with him stood speechless, hearing the voice but seeing no one. ^0907

Saul rose from the ground, and although his eyes were opened, he saw nothing. So they led him by the hand and brought him into Damascus. ^0908

And for three days he was without sight, and neither ate nor drank. ^0909

Now there was a disciple at Damascus named Ananias. The Lord said to him in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Here I am, Lord. ^0910

And the Lord said to him, Rise and go to the street called Straight, and at the house of Judas look for a man of Tarsus named Saul, for behold, he is praying, ^0911

and he has seen in a vision a man named Ananias come in and lay his hands on him so that he might regain his sight. ^0912

But Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard from many about this man, how much evil he has done to your saints at Jerusalem. ^0913

And here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call on your name. ^0914

But the Lord said to him, Go, for he is a chosen instrument of mine to carry my name before the Gentiles and kings and the children of Israel. ^0915

For I will show him how much he must suffer for the sake of my name. ^0916

So Ananias departed and entered the house. And laying his hands on him he said, Brother Saul, the Lord Jesus who appeared to you on the road by which you came has sent me so that you may regain your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit. ^0917

And immediately something like scales fell from his eyes, and he regained his sight. Then he rose and was baptized; ^0918

and taking food, he was strengthened. For some days he was with the disciples at Damascus. ^0919

And immediately he proclaimed Jesus in the synagogues, saying, He is the Son of God. ^0920

And all who heard him were amazed and said, Is not this the man who made havoc in Jerusalem of those who called upon this name? And has he not come here for this purpose, to bring them bound before the chief priests? ^0921

But Saul increased all the more in strength, and confounded the Jews who lived in Damascus by proving that Jesus was the Christ. ^0922

When many days had passed, the Jews plotted to kill him, ^0923

but their plot became known to Saul. They were watching the gates day and night in order to kill him, ^0924

but his disciples took him by night and let him down through an opening in the wall, lowering him in a basket. ^0925

And when he had come to Jerusalem, he attempted to join the disciples. And they were all afraid of him, for they did not believe that he was a disciple. ^0926

But Barnabas took him and brought him to the apostles and declared to them how on the road he had seen the Lord, who spoke to him, and how at Damascus he had preached boldly in the name of Jesus. ^0927

So he went in and out among them at Jerusalem, preaching boldly in the name of the Lord. ^0928

And he spoke and disputed against the Hellenists. But they were seeking to kill him. ^0929

And when the brothers learned this, they brought him down to Caesarea and sent him off to Tarsus. ^0930

So the church throughout all Judea and Galilee and Samaria had peace and was being built up. And walking in the fear of the Lord and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, it multiplied. ^0931

Now as Peter went here and there among them all, he came down also to the saints who lived at Lydda. ^0932

There he found a man named Aeneas, bedridden for eight years, who was paralyzed. ^0933

And Peter said to him, Aeneas, Jesus Christ heals you; rise and make your bed. And immediately he rose. ^0934

And all the residents of Lydda and Sharon saw him, and they turned to the Lord. ^0935

Now there was in Joppa a disciple named Tabitha, which, translated, means Dorcas. She was full of good works and acts of charity. ^0936

In those days she became ill and died, and when they had washed her, they laid her in an upper room. ^0937

Since Lydda was near Joppa, the disciples, hearing that Peter was there, sent two men to him, urging him, Please come to us without delay. ^0938

So Peter rose and went with them. And when he arrived, they took him to the upper room. All the widows stood beside him weeping and showing tunics and other garments that Dorcas made while she was with them. ^0939

But Peter put them all outside, and knelt down and prayed; and turning to the body he said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes, and when she saw Peter she sat up. ^0940

And he gave her his hand and raised her up. Then calling the saints and widows, he presented her alive. ^0941

And it became known throughout all Joppa, and many believed in the Lord. ^0942

And he stayed in Joppa for many days with one Simon, a tanner. ^0943



At Caesarea there was a man named Cornelius, a centurion of what was known as the Italian Cohort, ^1001

a devout man who feared God with all his household, gave alms generously to the people, and prayed continually to God. ^1002

About the ninth hour of the day he saw clearly in a vision an angel of God come in and say to him, Cornelius. ^1003

And he stared at him in terror and said, What is it, Lord? And he said to him, Your prayers and your alms have ascended as a memorial before God. ^1004

And now send men to Joppa and bring one Simon who is called Peter. ^1005

He is lodging with one Simon, a tanner, whose house is by the sea. ^1006

When the angel who spoke to him had departed, he called two of his servants and a devout soldier from among those who attended him, ^1007

and having related everything to them, he sent them to Joppa. ^1008

The next day, as they were on their journey and approaching the city, Peter went up on the housetop about the sixth hour to pray. ^1009

And he became hungry and wanted something to eat, but while they were preparing it, he fell into a trance ^1010

and saw the heavens opened and something like a great sheet descending, being let down by its four corners upon the earth. ^1011

In it were all kinds of animals and reptiles and birds of the air. ^1012

And there came a voice to him : Rise, Peter; kill and eat. ^1013

But Peter said, By no means, Lord; for I have never eaten anything that is common or unclean. ^1014

And the voice came to him again a second time, What God has made clean, do not call common. ^1015

This happened three times, and the thing was taken up at once to heaven. ^1016

Now while Peter was inwardly perplexed as to what the vision that he had seen might mean, behold, the men who were sent by Cornelius, having made inquiry for Simon’s house, stood at the gate ^1017

and called out to ask whether Simon who was called Peter was lodging there. ^1018

And while Peter was pondering the vision, the Spirit said to him, Behold, three men are looking for you. ^1019

Rise and go down and accompany them without hesitation, for I have sent them. ^1020

And Peter went down to the men and said, I am the one you are looking for. What is the reason for your coming? ^1021

And they said, Cornelius, a centurion, an upright and God - fearing man, who is well spoken of by the whole Jewish nation, was directed by a holy angel to send for you to come to his house and to hear what you have to say. ^1022

So he invited them in to be his guests. The next day he rose and went away with them, and some of the brothers from Joppa accompanied him. ^1023

And on the following day they entered Caesarea. Cornelius was expecting them and had called together his relatives and close friends. ^1024

When Peter entered, Cornelius met him and fell down at his feet and worshiped him. ^1025

But Peter lifted him up, saying, Stand up; I too am a man. ^1026

And as he talked with him, he went in and found many persons gathered. ^1027

And he said to them, You yourselves know how unlawful it is for a Jew to associate with or to visit anyone of another nation, but God has shown me that I should not call any person common or unclean. ^1028

So when I was sent for, I came without objection. I ask then why you sent for me. ^1029

And Cornelius said, Four days ago, about this hour, I was praying in my house at the ninth hour, and behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing ^1030

and said, Cornelius, your prayer has been heard and your alms have been remembered before God. ^1031

Send therefore to Joppa and ask for Simon who is called Peter. He is lodging in the house of Simon, a tanner, by the sea. ^1032

So I sent for you at once, and you have been kind enough to come. Now therefore we are all here in the presence of God to hear all that you have been commanded by the Lord. ^1033

So Peter opened his mouth and said : Truly I understand that God shows no partiality, ^1034

but in every nation anyone who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to him. ^1035

As for the word that he sent to Israel, preaching good news of peace through Jesus Christ ( he is Lord of all ), ^1036

you yourselves know what happened throughout all Judea, beginning from Galilee after the baptism that John proclaimed : ^1037

how God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power. He went about doing good and healing all who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with him. ^1038

And we are witnesses of all that he did both in the country of the Jews and in Jerusalem. They put him to death by hanging him on a tree, ^1039

but God raised him on the third day and made him to appear, ^1040

not to all the people but to us who had been chosen by God as witnesses, who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. ^1041

And he commanded us to preach to the people and to testify that he is the one appointed by God to be judge of the living and the dead. ^1042

To him all the prophets bear witness that everyone who believes in him receives forgiveness of sins through his name. ^1043

While Peter was still saying these things, the Holy Spirit fell on all who heard the word. ^1044

And the believers from among the circumcised who had come with Peter were amazed, because the gift of the Holy Spirit was poured out even on the Gentiles. ^1045

For they were hearing them speaking in tongues and extolling God. Then Peter declared, ^1046

Can anyone withhold water for baptizing these people, who have received the Holy Spirit just as we have? ^1047

And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they asked him to remain for some days. ^1048



Now the apostles and the brothers who were throughout Judea heard that the Gentiles also had received the word of God. ^1101

So when Peter went up to Jerusalem, the circumcision party criticized him, saying, ^1102

You went to uncircumcised men and ate with them. ^1103

But Peter began and explained it to them in order : ^1104

I was in the city of Joppa praying, and in a trance I saw a vision, something like a great sheet descending, being let down from heaven by its four corners, and it came down to me. ^1105

Looking at it closely, I observed animals and beasts of prey and reptiles and birds of the air. ^1106

And I heard a voice saying to me, Rise, Peter; kill and eat. ^1107

But I said, By no means, Lord; for nothing common or unclean has ever entered my mouth. ^1108

But the voice answered a second time from heaven, What God has made clean, do not call common. ^1109

This happened three times, and all was drawn up again into heaven. ^1110

And behold, at that very moment three men arrived at the house in which we were, sent to me from Caesarea. ^1111

And the Spirit told me to go with them, making no distinction. These six brothers also accompanied me, and we entered the man’s house. ^1112

And he told us how he had seen the angel stand in his house and say, Send to Joppa and bring Simon who is called Peter; ^1113

he will declare to you a message by which you will be saved, you and all your household. ^1114

As I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them just as on us at the beginning. ^1115

And I remembered the word of the Lord, how he said, John baptized with water, but you will be baptized with the Holy Spirit. ^1116

If then God gave the same gift to them as he gave to us when we believed in the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I that I could stand in God’s way? ^1117

When they heard these things they fell silent. And they glorified God, saying, Then to the Gentiles also God has granted repentance that leads to life. ^1118

Now those who were scattered because of the persecution that arose over Stephen traveled as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, speaking the word to no one except Jews. ^1119

But there were some of them, men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who on coming to Antioch spoke to the Hellenists also, preaching the Lord Jesus. ^1120

And the hand of the Lord was with them, and a great number who believed turned to the Lord. ^1121

The report of this came to the ears of the church in Jerusalem, and they sent Barnabas to Antioch. ^1122

When he came and saw the grace of God, he was glad, and he exhorted them all to remain faithful to the Lord with steadfast purpose, ^1123

for he was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and of faith. And a great many people were added to the Lord. ^1124

So Barnabas went to Tarsus to look for Saul, ^1125

and when he had found him, he brought him to Antioch. For a whole year they met with the church and taught a great many people. And in Antioch the disciples were first called Christians. ^1126

Now in these days prophets came down from Jerusalem to Antioch. ^1127

And one of them named Agabus stood up and foretold by the Spirit that there would be a great famine over all the world ( this took place in the days of Claudius ). ^1128

So the disciples determined, every one according to his ability, to send relief to the brothers living in Judea. ^1129

And they did so, sending it to the elders by the hand of Barnabas and Saul. ^1130



About that time Herod the king laid violent hands on some who belonged to the church. ^1201

He killed James the brother of John with the sword, ^1202

and when he saw that it pleased the Jews, he proceeded to arrest Peter also. This was during the days of Unleavened Bread. ^1203

And when he had seized him, he put him in prison, delivering him over to four squads of soldiers to guard him, intending after the Passover to bring him out to the people. ^1204

So Peter was kept in prison, but earnest prayer for him was made to God by the church. ^1205

Now when Herod was about to bring him out, on that very night, Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains, and sentries before the door were guarding the prison. ^1206

And behold, an angel of the Lord stood next to him, and a light shone in the cell. He struck Peter on the side and woke him, saying, Get up quickly. And the chains fell off his hands. ^1207

And the angel said to him, Dress yourself and put on your sandals. And he did so. And he said to him, Wrap your cloak around you and follow me. ^1208

And he went out and followed him. He did not know that what was being done by the angel was real, but thought he was seeing a vision. ^1209

When they had passed the first and the second guard, they came to the iron gate leading into the city. It opened for them of its own accord, and they went out and went along one street, and immediately the angel left him. ^1210

When Peter came to himself, he said, Now I am sure that the Lord has sent his angel and rescued me from the hand of Herod and from all that the Jewish people were expecting. ^1211

When he realized this, he went to the house of Mary, the mother of John whose other name was Mark, where many were gathered together and were praying. ^1212

And when he knocked at the door of the gateway, a servant girl named Rhoda came to answer. ^1213

Recognizing Peter’s voice, in her joy she did not open the gate but ran in and reported that Peter was standing at the gate. ^1214

They said to her, You are out of your mind. But she kept insisting that it was so, and they kept saying, It is his angel! ^1215

But Peter continued knocking, and when they opened, they saw him and were amazed. ^1216

But motioning to them with his hand to be silent, he described to them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, Tell these things to James and to the brothers. Then he departed and went to another place. ^1217

Now when day came, there was no little disturbance among the soldiers over what had become of Peter. ^1218

And after Herod searched for him and did not find him, he examined the sentries and ordered that they should be put to death. Then he went down from Judea to Caesarea and spent time there. ^1219

Now Herod was angry with the people of Tyre and Sidon, and they came to him with one accord, and having persuaded Blastus, the king’s chamberlain, they asked for peace, because their country depended on the king’s country for food. ^1220

On an appointed day Herod put on his royal robes, took his seat upon the throne, and delivered an oration to them. ^1221

And the people were shouting, The voice of a god, and not of a man! ^1222

Immediately an angel of the Lord struck him down, because he did not give God the glory, and he was eaten by worms and breathed his last. ^1223

But the word of God increased and multiplied. ^1224

And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem when they had completed their service, bringing with them John, whose other name was Mark. ^1225



Now there were in the church at Antioch prophets and teachers, Barnabas, Simeon who was called Niger, Lucius of Cyrene, Manaen a lifelong friend of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul. ^1301

While they were worshiping the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, Set apart for me Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them. ^1302

Then after fasting and praying they laid their hands on them and sent them off. ^1303

So, being sent out by the Holy Spirit, they went down to Seleucia, and from there they sailed to Cyprus. ^1304

When they arrived at Salamis, they proclaimed the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews. And they had John to assist them. ^1305

When they had gone through the whole island as far as Paphos, they came upon a certain magician, a Jewish false prophet named Bar-Jesus. ^1306

He was with the proconsul, Sergius Paulus, a man of intelligence, who summoned Barnabas and Saul and sought to hear the word of God. ^1307

But Elymas the magician ( for that is the meaning of his name ) opposed them, seeking to turn the proconsul away from the faith. ^1308

But Saul, who was also called Paul, filled with the Holy Spirit, looked intently at him ^1309

and said, You son of the devil, you enemy of all righteousness, full of all deceit and villainy, will you not stop making crooked the straight paths of the Lord? ^1310

And now, behold, the hand of the Lord is upon you, and you will be blind and unable to see the sun for a time. Immediately mist and darkness fell upon him, and he went about seeking people to lead him by the hand. ^1311

Then the proconsul believed, when he saw what had occurred, for he was astonished at the teaching of the Lord. ^1312

Now Paul and his companions set sail from Paphos and came to Perga in Pamphylia. And John left them and returned to Jerusalem, ^1313

but they went on from Perga and came to Antioch in Pisidia. And on the Sabbath day they went into the synagogue and sat down. ^1314

After the reading from the Law and the Prophets, the rulers of the synagogue sent a message to them, saying, Brothers, if you have any word of encouragement for the people, say it. ^1315

So Paul stood up, and motioning with his hand said : Men of Israel and you who fear God, listen. ^1316

The God of this people Israel chose our fathers and made the people great during their stay in the land of Egypt, and with uplifted arm he led them out of it. ^1317

And for about forty years he put up with them in the wilderness. ^1318

And after destroying seven nations in the land of Canaan, he gave them their land as an inheritance. ^1319

All this took about 450 years. And after that he gave them judges until Samuel the prophet. ^1320

Then they asked for a king, and God gave them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for forty years. ^1321

And when he had removed him, he raised up David to be their king, of whom he testified and said, I have found in David the son of Jesse a man after my heart, who will do all my will. ^1322

Of this man’s offspring God has brought to Israel a Savior, Jesus, as he promised. ^1323

Before his coming, John had proclaimed a baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel. ^1324

And as John was finishing his course, he said, What do you suppose that I am? I am not he. No, but behold, after me one is coming, the sandals of whose feet I am not worthy to untie. ^1325

Brothers, sons of the family of Abraham, and those among you who fear God, to us has been sent the message of this salvation. ^1326

For those who live in Jerusalem and their rulers, because they did not recognize him nor understand the utterances of the prophets, which are read every Sabbath, fulfilled them by condemning him. ^1327

And though they found in him no guilt worthy of death, they asked Pilate to have him executed. ^1328

And when they had carried out all that was written of him, they took him down from the tree and laid him in a tomb. ^1329

But God raised him from the dead, ^1330

and for many days he appeared to those who had come up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are now his witnesses to the people. ^1331

And we bring you the good news that what God promised to the fathers, ^1332

this he has fulfilled to us their children by raising Jesus, as also it is written in the second Psalm, You are my Son, today I have begotten you. ^1333

And as for the fact that he raised him from the dead, , no more to return to corruption, he has spoken in this way, I will give you the holy and sure blessings of David. ^1334

Therefore he says also in another psalm, You will not let your Holy One see corruption. ^1335

For David, after he had served the purpose of God in his own generation, fell asleep and was laid with his fathers and saw corruption, ^1336

but he whom God raised up did not see corruption. ^1337

Let it be known to you therefore, brothers, that through this man forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you, ^1338

and by him everyone who believes is freed from everything from which you could not be freed by the law of Moses. ^1339

Beware, therefore, lest what is said in the Prophets should come about : ^1340

Look, you scoffers, be astounded and perish; for I am doing a work in your days, a work that you will not believe, even if one tells it to you. ^1341

As they went out, the people begged that these things might be told them the next Sabbath. ^1342

And after the meeting of the synagogue broke up, many Jews and devout converts to Judaism followed Paul and Barnabas, who, as they spoke with them, urged them to continue in the grace of God. ^1343

The next Sabbath almost the whole city gathered to hear the word of the Lord. ^1344

But when the Jews saw the crowds, they were filled with jealousy and began to contradict what was spoken by Paul, reviling him. ^1345

And Paul and Barnabas spoke out boldly, saying, It was necessary that the word of God be spoken first to you. Since you thrust it aside and judge yourselves unworthy of eternal life, behold, we are turning to the Gentiles. ^1346

For so the Lord has commanded us, saying, I have made you a light for the Gentiles, that you may bring salvation to the ends of the earth. ^1347

And when the Gentiles heard this, they began rejoicing and glorifying the word of the Lord, and as many as were appointed to eternal life believed. ^1348

And the word of the Lord was spreading throughout the whole region. ^1349

But the Jews incited the devout women of high standing and the leading men of the city, stirred up persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and drove them out of their district. ^1350

But they shook off the dust from their feet against them and went to Iconium. ^1351

And the disciples were filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit. ^1352



Now at Iconium they entered together into the Jewish synagogue and spoke in such a way that a great number of both Jews and Greeks believed. ^1401

But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles and poisoned their minds against the brothers. ^1402

So they remained for a long time, speaking boldly for the Lord, who bore witness to the word of his grace, granting signs and wonders to be done by their hands. ^1403

But the people of the city were divided; some sided with the Jews and some with the apostles. ^1404

When an attempt was made by both Gentiles and Jews, with their rulers, to mistreat them and to stone them, ^1405

they learned of it and fled to Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and to the surrounding country, ^1406

and there they continued to preach the gospel. ^1407

Now at Lystra there was a man sitting who could not use his feet. He was crippled from birth and had never walked. ^1408

He listened to Paul speaking. And Paul, looking intently at him and seeing that he had faith to be made well, ^1409

said in a loud voice, Stand upright on your feet. And he sprang up and began walking. ^1410

And when the crowds saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in Lycaonian, The gods have come down to us in the likeness of men! ^1411

Barnabas they called Zeus, and Paul, Hermes, because he was the chief speaker. ^1412

And the priest of Zeus, whose temple was at the entrance to the city, brought oxen and garlands to the gates and wanted to offer sacrifice with the crowds. ^1413

But when the apostles Barnabas and Paul heard of it, they tore their garments and rushed out into the crowd, crying out, ^1414

Men, why are you doing these things? We also are men, of like nature with you, and we bring you good news, that you should turn from these vain things to a living God, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and all that is in them. ^1415

In past generations he allowed all the nations to walk in their own ways. ^1416

Yet he did not leave himself without witness, for he did good by giving you rains from heaven and fruitful seasons, satisfying your hearts with food and gladness. ^1417

Even with these words they scarcely restrained the people from offering sacrifice to them. ^1418

But Jews came from Antioch and Iconium, and having persuaded the crowds, they stoned Paul and dragged him out of the city, supposing that he was dead. ^1419

But when the disciples gathered about him, he rose up and entered the city, and on the next day he went on with Barnabas to Derbe. ^1420

When they had preached the gospel to that city and had made many disciples, they returned to Lystra and to Iconium and to Antioch, ^1421

strengthening the souls of the disciples, encouraging them to continue in the faith, and saying that through many tribulations we must enter the kingdom of God. ^1422

And when they had appointed elders for them in every church, with prayer and fasting they committed them to the Lord in whom they had believed. ^1423

Then they passed through Pisidia and came to Pamphylia. ^1424

And when they had spoken the word in Perga, they went down to Attalia, ^1425

and from there they sailed to Antioch, where they had been commended to the grace of God for the work that they had fulfilled. ^1426

And when they arrived and gathered the church together, they declared all that God had done with them, and how he had opened a door of faith to the Gentiles. ^1427

And they remained no little time with the disciples. ^1428



But some men came down from Judea and were teaching the brothers, Unless you are circumcised according to the custom of Moses, you cannot be saved. ^1501

And after Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and debate with them, Paul and Barnabas and some of the others were appointed to go up to Jerusalem to the apostles and the elders about this question. ^1502

So, being sent on their way by the church, they passed through both Phoenicia and Samaria, describing in detail the conversion of the Gentiles, and brought great joy to all the brothers. ^1503

When they came to Jerusalem, they were welcomed by the church and the apostles and the elders, and they declared all that God had done with them. ^1504

But some believers who belonged to the party of the Pharisees rose up and said, It is necessary to circumcise them and to order them to keep the law of Moses. ^1505

The apostles and the elders were gathered together to consider this matter. ^1506

And after there had been much debate, Peter stood up and said to them, Brothers, you know that in the early days God made a choice among you, that by my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel and believe. ^1507

And God, who knows the heart, bore witness to them, by giving them the Holy Spirit just as he did to us, ^1508

and he made no distinction between us and them, having cleansed their hearts by faith. ^1509

Now, therefore, why are you putting God to the test by placing a yoke on the neck of the disciples that neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear? ^1510

But we believe that we will be saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus, just as they will. ^1511

And all the assembly fell silent, and they listened to Barnabas and Paul as they related what signs and wonders God had done through them among the Gentiles. ^1512

After they finished speaking, James replied, Brothers, listen to me. ^1513

Simeon has related how God first visited the Gentiles, to take from them a people for his name. ^1514

And with this the words of the prophets agree, just as it is written, ^1515

After this I will return, and I will rebuild the tent of David that has fallen; I will rebuild its ruins, and I will restore it, ^1516

that the remnant of mankind may seek the Lord, and all the Gentiles who are called by my name, says the Lord, who makes these things ^1517

known from of old. ^1518

Therefore my judgment is that we should not trouble those of the Gentiles who turn to God, ^1519

but should write to them to abstain from the things polluted by idols, and from sexual immorality, and from what has been strangled, and from blood. ^1520

For from ancient generations Moses has had in every city those who proclaim him, for he is read every Sabbath in the synagogues. ^1521

Then it seemed good to the apostles and the elders, with the whole church, to choose men from among them and send them to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas. They sent Judas called Barsabbas, and Silas, leading men among the brothers, ^1522

with the following letter : The brothers, both the apostles and the elders, to the brothers who are of the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia, greetings. ^1523

Since we have heard that some persons have gone out from us and troubled you with words, unsettling your minds, although we gave them no instructions, ^1524

it has seemed good to us, having come to one accord, to choose men and send them to you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul, ^1525

men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. ^1526

We have therefore sent Judas and Silas, who themselves will tell you the same things by word of mouth. ^1527

For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us to lay on you no greater burden than these requirements : ^1528

that you abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what has been strangled, and from sexual immorality. If you keep yourselves from these, you will do well. Farewell. ^1529

So when they were sent off, they went down to Antioch, and having gathered the congregation together, they delivered the letter. ^1530

And when they had read it, they rejoiced because of its encouragement. ^1531

And Judas and Silas, who were themselves prophets, encouraged and strengthened the brothers with many words. ^1532

And after they had spent some time, they were sent off in peace by the brothers to those who had sent them. ^1533

And after they had spent some time, they were sent off in peace by the brothers to those who had sent them. ^1534

But Paul and Barnabas remained in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also. ^1535

And after some days Paul said to Barnabas, Let us return and visit the brothers in every city where we proclaimed the word of the Lord, and see how they are. ^1536

Now Barnabas wanted to take with them John called Mark. ^1537

But Paul thought best not to take with them one who had withdrawn from them in Pamphylia and had not gone with them to the work. ^1538

And there arose a sharp disagreement, so that they separated from each other. Barnabas took Mark with him and sailed away to Cyprus, ^1539

but Paul chose Silas and departed, having been commended by the brothers to the grace of the Lord. ^1540

And he went through Syria and Cilicia, strengthening the churches. ^1541



Paul came also to Derbe and to Lystra. A disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a Jewish woman who was a believer, but his father was a Greek. ^1601

He was well spoken of by the brothers at Lystra and Iconium. ^1602

Paul wanted Timothy to accompany him, and he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those places, for they all knew that his father was a Greek. ^1603

As they went on their way through the cities, they delivered to them for observance the decisions that had been reached by the apostles and elders who were in Jerusalem. ^1604

So the churches were strengthened in the faith, and they increased in numbers daily. ^1605

And they went through the region of Phrygia and Galatia, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia. ^1606

And when they had come up to Mysia, they attempted to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them. ^1607

So, passing by Mysia, they went down to Troas. ^1608

And a vision appeared to Paul in the night : a man of Macedonia was standing there, urging him and saying, Come over to Macedonia and help us. ^1609

And when Paul had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go on into Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them. ^1610

So, setting sail from Troas, we made a direct voyage to Samothrace, and the following day to Neapolis, ^1611

and from there to Philippi, which is a leading city of the district of Macedonia and a Roman colony. We remained in this city some days. ^1612

And on the Sabbath day we went outside the gate to the riverside, where we supposed there was a place of prayer, and we sat down and spoke to the women who had come together. ^1613

One who heard us was a woman named Lydia, from the city of Thyatira, a seller of purple goods, who was a worshiper of God. The Lord opened her heart to pay attention to what was said by Paul. ^1614

And after she was baptized, and her household as well, she urged us, saying, If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come to my house and stay. And she prevailed upon us. ^1615

As we were going to the place of prayer, we were met by a slave girl who had a spirit of divination and brought her owners much gain by fortune-telling. ^1616

She followed Paul and us, crying out, These men are servants of the Most High God, who proclaim to you the way of salvation. ^1617

And this she kept doing for many days. Paul, having become greatly annoyed, turned and said to the spirit, I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And it came out that very hour. ^1618

But when her owners saw that their hope of gain was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the marketplace before the rulers. ^1619

And when they had brought them to the magistrates, they said, These men are Jews, and they are disturbing our city. ^1620

They advocate customs that are not lawful for us as Romans to accept or practice. ^1621

The crowd joined in attacking them, and the magistrates tore the garments off them and gave orders to beat them with rods. ^1622

And when they had inflicted many blows upon them, they threw them into prison, ordering the jailer to keep them safely. ^1623

Having received this order, he put them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks. ^1624

About midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them, ^1625

and suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken. And immediately all the doors were opened, and everyone’s bonds were unfastened. ^1626

When the jailer woke and saw that the prison doors were open, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped. ^1627

But Paul cried with a loud voice, Do not harm yourself, for we are all here. ^1628

And the jailer called for lights and rushed in, and trembling with fear he fell down before Paul and Silas. ^1629

Then he brought them out and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved? ^1630

And they said, Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household. ^1631

And they spoke the word of the Lord to him and to all who were in his house. ^1632

And he took them the same hour of the night and washed their wounds; and he was baptized at once, he and all his family. ^1633

Then he brought them up into his house and set food before them. And he rejoiced along with his entire household that he had believed in God. ^1634

But when it was day, the magistrates sent the police, saying, Let those men go. ^1635

And the jailer reported these words to Paul, saying, The magistrates have sent to let you go. Therefore come out now and go in peace. ^1636

But Paul said to them, They have beaten us publicly, uncondemned, men who are Roman citizens, and have thrown us into prison; and do they now throw us out secretly? No! Let them come themselves and take us out. ^1637

The police reported these words to the magistrates, and they were afraid when they heard that they were Roman citizens. ^1638

So they came and apologized to them. And they took them out and asked them to leave the city. ^1639

So they went out of the prison and visited Lydia. And when they had seen the brothers, they encouraged them and departed. ^1640



Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where there was a synagogue of the Jews. ^1701

And Paul went in, as was his custom, and on three Sabbath days he reasoned with them from the Scriptures, ^1702

explaining and proving that it was necessary for the Christ to suffer and to rise from the dead, and saying, This Jesus, whom I proclaim to you, is the Christ. ^1703

And some of them were persuaded and joined Paul and Silas, as did a great many of the devout Greeks and not a few of the leading women. ^1704

But the Jews were jealous, and taking some wicked men of the rabble, they formed a mob, set the city in an uproar, and attacked the house of Jason, seeking to bring them out to the crowd. ^1705

And when they could not find them, they dragged Jason and some of the brothers before the city authorities, shouting, These men who have turned the world upside down have come here also, ^1706

and Jason has received them, and they are all acting against the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, Jesus. ^1707

And the people and the city authorities were disturbed when they heard these things. ^1708

And when they had taken money as security from Jason and the rest, they let them go. ^1709

The brothers immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Berea, and when they arrived they went into the Jewish synagogue. ^1710

Now these Jews were more noble than those in Thessalonica; they received the word with all eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily to see if these things were so. ^1711

Many of them therefore believed, with not a few Greek women of high standing as well as men. ^1712

But when the Jews from Thessalonica learned that the word of God was proclaimed by Paul at Berea also, they came there too, agitating and stirring up the crowds. ^1713

Then the brothers immediately sent Paul off on his way to the sea, but Silas and Timothy remained there. ^1714

Those who conducted Paul brought him as far as Athens, and after receiving a command for Silas and Timothy to come to him as soon as possible, they departed. ^1715

Now while Paul was waiting for them at Athens, his spirit was provoked within him as he saw that the city was full of idols. ^1716

So he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews and the devout persons, and in the marketplace every day with those who happened to be there. ^1717

Some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers also conversed with him. And some said, What does this babbler wish to say? Others said, He seems to be a preacher of foreign divinities — because he was preaching Jesus and the resurrection. ^1718

And they took him and brought him to the Areopagus, saying, May we know what this new teaching is that you are presenting? ^1719

For you bring some strange things to our ears. We wish to know therefore what these things mean. ^1720

Now all the Athenians and the foreigners who lived there would spend their time in nothing except telling or hearing something new. ^1721

So Paul, standing in the midst of the Areopagus, said : Men of Athens, I perceive that in every way you are very religious. ^1722

For as I passed along and observed the objects of your worship, I found also an altar with this inscription, To the unknown god. What therefore you worship as unknown, this I proclaim to you. ^1723

The God who made the world and everything in it, being Lord of heaven and earth, does not live in temples made by man, ^1724

nor is he served by human hands, as though he needed anything, since he himself gives to all mankind life and breath and everything. ^1725

And he made from one man every nation of mankind to live on all the face of the earth, having determined allotted periods and the boundaries of their dwelling place, ^1726

that they should seek God, and perhaps feel their way toward him and find him. Yet he is actually not far from each one of us, ^1727

for In him we live and move and have our being; as even some of your own poets have said, For we are indeed his offspring. ^1728

Being then God’s offspring, we ought not to think that the divine being is like gold or silver or stone, an image formed by the art and imagination of man. ^1729

The times of ignorance God overlooked, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent, ^1730

because he has fixed a day on which he will judge the world in righteousness by a man whom he has appointed; and of this he has given assurance to all by raising him from the dead. ^1731

Now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked. But others said, We will hear you again about this. ^1732

So Paul went out from their midst. ^1733

But some men joined him and believed, among whom also were Dionysius the Areopagite and a woman named Damaris and others with them. ^1734



After this Paul left Athens and went to Corinth. ^1801

And he found a Jew named Aquila, a native of Pontus, recently come from Italy with his wife Priscilla, because Claudius had commanded all the Jews to leave Rome. And he went to see them, ^1802

and because he was of the same trade he stayed with them and worked, for they were tentmakers by trade. ^1803

And he reasoned in the synagogue every Sabbath, and tried to persuade Jews and Greeks. ^1804

When Silas and Timothy arrived from Macedonia, Paul was occupied with the word, testifying to the Jews that the Christ was Jesus. ^1805

And when they opposed and reviled him, he shook out his garments and said to them, Your blood be on your own heads! I am innocent. From now on I will go to the Gentiles. ^1806

And he left there and went to the house of a man named Titius Justus, a worshiper of God. His house was next door to the synagogue. ^1807

Crispus, the ruler of the synagogue, believed in the Lord, together with his entire household. And many of the Corinthians hearing Paul believed and were baptized. ^1808

And the Lord said to Paul one night in a vision, Do not be afraid, but go on speaking and do not be silent, ^1809

for I am with you, and no one will attack you to harm you, for I have many in this city who are my people. ^1810

And he stayed a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them. ^1811

But when Gallio was proconsul of Achaia, the Jews made a united attack on Paul and brought him before the tribunal, ^1812

saying, This man is persuading people to worship God contrary to the law. ^1813

But when Paul was about to open his mouth, Gallio said to the Jews, If it were a matter of wrongdoing or vicious crime, O Jews, I would have reason to accept your complaint. ^1814

But since it is a matter of questions about words and names and your own law, see to it yourselves. I refuse to be a judge of these things. ^1815

And he drove them from the tribunal. ^1816

And they all seized Sosthenes, the ruler of the synagogue, and beat him in front of the tribunal. But Gallio paid no attention to any of this. ^1817

After this, Paul stayed many days longer and then took leave of the brothers and set sail for Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila. At Cenchreae he had cut his hair, for he was under a vow. ^1818

And they came to Ephesus, and he left them there, but he himself went into the synagogue and reasoned with the Jews. ^1819

When they asked him to stay for a longer period, he declined. ^1820

But on taking leave of them he said, I will return to you if God wills, and he set sail from Ephesus. ^1821

When he had landed at Caesarea, he went up and greeted the church, and then went down to Antioch. ^1822

After spending some time there, he departed and went from one place to the next through the region of Galatia and Phrygia, strengthening all the disciples. ^1823

Now a Jew named Apollos, a native of Alexandria, came to Ephesus. He was an eloquent man, competent in the Scriptures. ^1824

He had been instructed in the way of the Lord. And being fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus, though he knew only the baptism of John. ^1825

He began to speak boldly in the synagogue, but when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him aside and explained to him the way of God more accurately. ^1826

And when he wished to cross to Achaia, the brothers encouraged him and wrote to the disciples to welcome him. When he arrived, he greatly helped those who through grace had believed, ^1827

for he powerfully refuted the Jews in public, showing by the Scriptures that the Christ was Jesus. ^1828



And it happened that while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul passed through the inland country and came to Ephesus. There he found some disciples. ^1901

And he said to them, Did you receive the Holy Spirit when you believed? And they said, No, we have not even heard that there is a Holy Spirit. ^1902

And he said, Into what then were you baptized? They said, Into John’s baptism. ^1903

And Paul said, John baptized with the baptism of repentance, telling the people to believe in the one who was to come after him, that is, Jesus. ^1904

On hearing this, they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. ^1905

And when Paul had laid his hands on them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they began speaking in tongues and prophesying. ^1906

There were about twelve men in all. ^1907

And he entered the synagogue and for three months spoke boldly, reasoning and persuading them about the kingdom of God. ^1908

But when some became stubborn and continued in unbelief, speaking evil of the Way before the congregation, he withdrew from them and took the disciples with him, reasoning daily in the hall of Tyrannus. ^1909

This continued for two years, so that all the residents of Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks. ^1910

And God was doing extraordinary miracles by the hands of Paul, ^1911

so that even handkerchiefs or aprons that had touched his skin were carried away to the sick, and their diseases left them and the evil spirits came out of them. ^1912

Then some of the itinerant Jewish exorcists undertook to invoke the name of the Lord Jesus over those who had evil spirits, saying, I adjure you by the Jesus whom Paul proclaims. ^1913

Seven sons of a Jewish high priest named Sceva were doing this. ^1914

But the evil spirit answered them, Jesus I know, and Paul I recognize, but who are you? ^1915

And the man in whom was the evil spirit leaped on them, mastered all of them and overpowered them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded. ^1916

And this became known to all the residents of Ephesus, both Jews and Greeks. And fear fell upon them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was extolled. ^1917

Also many of those who were now believers came, confessing and divulging their practices. ^1918

And a number of those who had practiced magic arts brought their books together and burned them in the sight of all. And they counted the value of them and found it came to fifty thousand pieces of silver. ^1919

So the word of the Lord continued to increase and prevail mightily. ^1920

Now after these events Paul resolved in the Spirit to pass through Macedonia and Achaia and go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome. ^1921

And having sent into Macedonia two of his helpers, Timothy and Erastus, he himself stayed in Asia for a while. ^1922

About that time there arose no little disturbance concerning the Way. ^1923

For a man named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines of Artemis, brought no little business to the craftsmen. ^1924

These he gathered together, with the workmen in similar trades, and said, Men, you know that from this business we have our wealth. ^1925

And you see and hear that not only in Ephesus but in almost all of Asia this Paul has persuaded and turned away a great many people, saying that gods made with hands are not gods. ^1926

And there is danger not only that this trade of ours may come into disrepute but also that the temple of the great goddess Artemis may be counted as nothing, and that she may even be deposed from her magnificence, she whom all Asia and the world worship. ^1927

When they heard this they were enraged and were crying out, Great is Artemis of the Ephesians! ^1928

So the city was filled with the confusion, and they rushed together into the theater, dragging with them Gaius and Aristarchus, Macedonians who were Paul’s companions in travel. ^1929

But when Paul wished to go in among the crowd, the disciples would not let him. ^1930

And even some of the Asiarchs, who were friends of his, sent to him and were urging him not to venture into the theater. ^1931

Now some cried out one thing, some another, for the assembly was in confusion, and most of them did not know why they had come together. ^1932

Some of the crowd prompted Alexander, whom the Jews had put forward. And Alexander, motioning with his hand, wanted to make a defense to the crowd. ^1933

But when they recognized that he was a Jew, for about two hours they all cried out with one voice, Great is Artemis of the Ephesians! ^1934

And when the town clerk had quieted the crowd, he said, Men of Ephesus, who is there who does not know that the city of the Ephesians is temple keeper of the great Artemis, and of the sacred stone that fell from the sky? ^1935

Seeing then that these things cannot be denied, you ought to be quiet and do nothing rash. ^1936

For you have brought these men here who are neither sacrilegious nor blasphemers of our goddess. ^1937

If therefore Demetrius and the craftsmen with him have a complaint against anyone, the courts are open, and there are proconsuls. Let them bring charges against one another. ^1938

But if you seek anything further, it shall be settled in the regular assembly. ^1939

For we really are in danger of being charged with rioting today, since there is no cause that we can give to justify this commotion. ^1940

And when he had said these things, he dismissed the assembly. ^1941



After the uproar ceased, Paul sent for the disciples, and after encouraging them, he said farewell and departed for Macedonia. ^2001

When he had gone through those regions and had given them much encouragement, he came to Greece. ^2002

There he spent three months, and when a plot was made against him by the Jews as he was about to set sail for Syria, he decided to return through Macedonia. ^2003

Sopater the Berean, son of Pyrrhus, accompanied him; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy; and the Asians, Tychicus and Trophimus. ^2004

These went on ahead and were waiting for us at Troas, ^2005

but we sailed away from Philippi after the days of Unleavened Bread, and in five days we came to them at Troas, where we stayed for seven days. ^2006

On the first day of the week, when we were gathered together to break bread, Paul talked with them, intending to depart on the next day, and he prolonged his speech until midnight. ^2007

There were many lamps in the upper room where we were gathered. ^2008

And a young man named Eutychus, sitting at the window, sank into a deep sleep as Paul talked still longer. And being overcome by sleep, he fell down from the third story and was taken up dead. ^2009

But Paul went down and bent over him, and taking him in his arms, said, Do not be alarmed, for his life is in him. ^2010

And when Paul had gone up and had broken bread and eaten, he conversed with them a long while, until daybreak, and so departed. ^2011

And they took the youth away alive, and were not a little comforted. ^2012

But going ahead to the ship, we set sail for Assos, intending to take Paul aboard there, for so he had arranged, intending himself to go by land. ^2013

And when he met us at Assos, we took him on board and went to Mitylene. ^2014

And sailing from there we came the following day opposite Chios; the next day we touched at Samos; and the day after that we went to Miletus. ^2015

For Paul had decided to sail past Ephesus, so that he might not have to spend time in Asia, for he was hastening to be at Jerusalem, if possible, on the day of Pentecost. ^2016

Now from Miletus he sent to Ephesus and called the elders of the church to come to him. ^2017

And when they came to him, he said to them : You yourselves know how I lived among you the whole time from the first day that I set foot in Asia, ^2018

serving the Lord with all humility and with tears and with trials that happened to me through the plots of the Jews; ^2019

how I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, and teaching you in public and from house to house, ^2020

testifying both to Jews and to Greeks of repentance toward God and of faith in our Lord Jesus Christ. ^2021

And now, behold, I am going to Jerusalem, constrained by the Spirit, not knowing what will happen to me there, ^2022

except that the Holy Spirit testifies to me in every city that imprisonment and afflictions await me. ^2023

But I do not account my life of any value nor as precious to myself, if only I may finish my course and the ministry that I received from the Lord Jesus, to testify to the gospel of the grace of God. ^2024

And now, behold, I know that none of you among whom I have gone about proclaiming the kingdom will see my face again. ^2025

Therefore I testify to you this day that I am innocent of the blood of all, ^2026

for I did not shrink from declaring to you the whole counsel of God. ^2027

Pay careful attention to yourselves and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to care for the church of God, which he obtained with his own blood. ^2028

I know that after my departure fierce wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock; ^2029

and from among your own selves will arise men speaking twisted things, to draw away the disciples after them. ^2030

Therefore be alert, remembering that for three years I did not cease night or day to admonish every one with tears. ^2031

And now I commend you to God and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up and to give you the inheritance among all those who are sanctified. ^2032

I coveted no one’s silver or gold or apparel. ^2033

You yourselves know that these hands ministered to my necessities and to those who were with me. ^2034

In all things I have shown you that by working hard in this way we must help the weak and remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he himself said, It is more blessed to give than to receive. ^2035

And when he had said these things, he knelt down and prayed with them all. ^2036

And there was much weeping on the part of all; they embraced Paul and kissed him, ^2037

being sorrowful most of all because of the word he had spoken, that they would not see his face again. And they accompanied him to the ship. ^2038



And when we had parted from them and set sail, we came by a straight course to Cos, and the next day to Rhodes, and from there to Patara. ^2101

And having found a ship crossing to Phoenicia, we went aboard and set sail. ^2102

When we had come in sight of Cyprus, leaving it on the left we sailed to Syria and landed at Tyre, for there the ship was to unload its cargo. ^2103

And having sought out the disciples, we stayed there for seven days. And through the Spirit they were telling Paul not to go on to Jerusalem. ^2104

When our days there were ended, we departed and went on our journey, and they all, with wives and children, accompanied us until we were outside the city. And kneeling down on the beach, we prayed ^2105

and said farewell to one another. Then we went on board the ship, and they returned home. ^2106

When we had finished the voyage from Tyre, we arrived at Ptolemais, and we greeted the brothers and stayed with them for one day. ^2107

On the next day we departed and came to Caesarea, and we entered the house of Philip the evangelist, who was one of the seven, and stayed with him. ^2108

He had four unmarried daughters, who prophesied. ^2109

While we were staying for many days, a prophet named Agabus came down from Judea. ^2110

And coming to us, he took Paul’s belt and bound his own feet and hands and said, Thus says the Holy Spirit, This is how the Jews at Jerusalem will bind the man who owns this belt and deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles. ^2111

When we heard this, we and the people there urged him not to go up to Jerusalem. ^2112

Then Paul answered, What are you doing, weeping and breaking my heart? For I am ready not only to be imprisoned but even to die in Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus. ^2113

And since he would not be persuaded, we ceased and said, Let the will of the Lord be done. ^2114

After these days we got ready and went up to Jerusalem. ^2115

And some of the disciples from Caesarea went with us, bringing us to the house of Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we should lodge. ^2116

When we had come to Jerusalem, the brothers received us gladly. ^2117

On the following day Paul went in with us to James, and all the elders were present. ^2118

After greeting them, he related one by one the things that God had done among the Gentiles through his ministry. ^2119

And when they heard it, they glorified God. And they said to him, You see, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews of those who have believed. They are all zealous for the law, ^2120

and they have been told about you that you teach all the Jews who are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, telling them not to circumcise their children or walk according to our customs. ^2121

What then is to be done? They will certainly hear that you have come. ^2122

Do therefore what we tell you. We have four men who are under a vow; ^2123

take these men and purify yourself along with them and pay their expenses, so that they may shave their heads. Thus all will know that there is nothing in what they have been told about you, but that you yourself also live in observance of the law. ^2124

But as for the Gentiles who have believed, we have sent a letter with our judgment that they should abstain from what has been sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from what has been strangled, and from sexual immorality. ^2125

Then Paul took the men, and the next day he purified himself along with them and went into the temple, giving notice when the days of purification would be fulfilled and the offering presented for each one of them. ^2126

When the seven days were almost completed, the Jews from Asia, seeing him in the temple, stirred up the whole crowd and laid hands on him, ^2127

crying out, Men of Israel, help! This is the man who is teaching everyone everywhere against the people and the law and this place. Moreover, he even brought Greeks into the temple and has defiled this holy place. ^2128

For they had previously seen Trophimus the Ephesian with him in the city, and they supposed that Paul had brought him into the temple. ^2129

Then all the city was stirred up, and the people ran together. They seized Paul and dragged him out of the temple, and at once the gates were shut. ^2130

And as they were seeking to kill him, word came to the tribune of the cohort that all Jerusalem was in confusion. ^2131

He at once took soldiers and centurions and ran down to them. And when they saw the tribune and the soldiers, they stopped beating Paul. ^2132

Then the tribune came up and arrested him and ordered him to be bound with two chains. He inquired who he was and what he had done. ^2133

Some in the crowd were shouting one thing, some another. And as he could not learn the facts because of the uproar, he ordered him to be brought into the barracks. ^2134

And when he came to the steps, he was actually carried by the soldiers because of the violence of the crowd, ^2135

for the mob of the people followed, crying out, Away with him! ^2136

As Paul was about to be brought into the barracks, he said to the tribune, May I say something to you? And he said, Do you know Greek? ^2137

Are you not the Egyptian, then, who recently stirred up a revolt and led the four thousand men of the Assassins out into the wilderness? ^2138

Paul replied, I am a Jew, from Tarsus in Cilicia, a citizen of no obscure city. I beg you, permit me to speak to the people. ^2139

And when he had given him permission, Paul, standing on the steps, motioned with his hand to the people. And when there was a great hush, he addressed them in the Hebrew language, saying : ^2140



Brothers and fathers, hear the defense that I now make before you. ^2201

And when they heard that he was addressing them in the Hebrew language, they became even more quiet. And he said : ^2202

I am a Jew, born in Tarsus in Cilicia, but brought up in this city, educated at the feet of Gamaliel according to the strict manner of the law of our fathers, being zealous for God as all of you are this day. ^2203

I persecuted this Way to the death, binding and delivering to prison both men and women, ^2204

as the high priest and the whole council of elders can bear me witness. From them I received letters to the brothers, and I journeyed toward Damascus to take those also who were there and bring them in bonds to Jerusalem to be punished. ^2205

As I was on my way and drew near to Damascus, about noon a great light from heaven suddenly shone around me. ^2206

And I fell to the ground and heard a voice saying to me, Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? ^2207

And I answered, Who are you, Lord? And he said to me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom you are persecuting. ^2208

Now those who were with me saw the light but did not understand the voice of the one who was speaking to me. ^2209

And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said to me, Rise, and go into Damascus, and there you will be told all that is appointed for you to do. ^2210

And since I could not see because of the brightness of that light, I was led by the hand by those who were with me, and came into Damascus. ^2211

And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, well spoken of by all the Jews who lived there, ^2212

came to me, and standing by me said to me, Brother Saul, receive your sight. And at that very hour I received my sight and saw him. ^2213

And he said, The God of our fathers appointed you to know his will, to see the Righteous One and to hear a voice from his mouth; ^2214

for you will be a witness for him to everyone of what you have seen and heard. ^2215

And now why do you wait? Rise and be baptized and wash away your sins, calling on his name. ^2216

When I had returned to Jerusalem and was praying in the temple, I fell into a trance ^2217

and saw him saying to me, Make haste and get out of Jerusalem quickly, because they will not accept your testimony about me. ^2218

And I said, Lord, they themselves know that in one synagogue after another I imprisoned and beat those who believed in you. ^2219

And when the blood of Stephen your witness was being shed, I myself was standing by and approving and watching over the garments of those who killed him. ^2220

And he said to me, Go, for I will send you far away to the Gentiles. ^2221

Up to this word they listened to him. Then they raised their voices and said, Away with such a fellow from the earth! For he should not be allowed to live. ^2222

And as they were shouting and throwing off their cloaks and flinging dust into the air, ^2223

the tribune ordered him to be brought into the barracks, saying that he should be examined by flogging, to find out why they were shouting against him like this. ^2224

But when they had stretched him out for the whips, Paul said to the centurion who was standing by, Is it lawful for you to flog a man who is a Roman citizen and uncondemned? ^2225

When the centurion heard this, he went to the tribune and said to him, What are you about to do? For this man is a Roman citizen. ^2226

So the tribune came and said to him, Tell me, are you a Roman citizen? And he said, Yes. ^2227

The tribune answered, I bought this citizenship for a large sum. Paul said, But I am a citizen by birth. ^2228

So those who were about to examine him withdrew from him immediately, and the tribune also was afraid, for he realized that Paul was a Roman citizen and that he had bound him. ^2229

But on the next day, desiring to know the real reason why he was being accused by the Jews, he unbound him and commanded the chief priests and all the council to meet, and he brought Paul down and set him before them. ^2230



And looking intently at the council, Paul said, Brothers, I have lived my life before God in all good conscience up to this day. ^2301

And the high priest Ananias commanded those who stood by him to strike him on the mouth. ^2302

Then Paul said to him, God is going to strike you, you whitewashed wall! Are you sitting to judge me according to the law, and yet contrary to the law you order me to be struck? ^2303

Those who stood by said, Would you revile God’s high priest? ^2304

And Paul said, I did not know, brothers, that he was the high priest, for it is written, You shall not speak evil of a ruler of your people. ^2305

Now when Paul perceived that one part were Sadducees and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Brothers, I am a Pharisee, a son of Pharisees. It is with respect to the hope and the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial. ^2306

And when he had said this, a dissension arose between the Pharisees and the Sadducees, and the assembly was divided. ^2307

For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, nor angel, nor spirit, but the Pharisees acknowledge them all. ^2308

Then a great clamor arose, and some of the scribes of the Pharisees ’ party stood up and contended sharply, We find nothing wrong in this man. What if a spirit or an angel spoke to him? ^2309

And when the dissension became violent, the tribune, afraid that Paul would be torn to pieces by them, commanded the soldiers to go down and take him away from among them by force and bring him into the barracks. ^2310

The following night the Lord stood by him and said, Take courage, for as you have testified to the facts about me in Jerusalem, so you must testify also in Rome. ^2311

When it was day, the Jews made a plot and bound themselves by an oath neither to eat nor drink till they had killed Paul. ^2312

There were more than forty who made this conspiracy. ^2313

They went to the chief priests and elders and said, We have strictly bound ourselves by an oath to taste no food till we have killed Paul. ^2314

Now therefore you, along with the council, give notice to the tribune to bring him down to you, as though you were going to determine his case more exactly. And we are ready to kill him before he comes near. ^2315

Now the son of Paul’s sister heard of their ambush, so he went and entered the barracks and told Paul. ^2316

Paul called one of the centurions and said, Take this young man to the tribune, for he has something to tell him. ^2317

So he took him and brought him to the tribune and said, Paul the prisoner called me and asked me to bring this young man to you, as he has something to say to you. ^2318

The tribune took him by the hand, and going aside asked him privately, What is it that you have to tell me? ^2319

And he said, The Jews have agreed to ask you to bring Paul down to the council tomorrow, as though they were going to inquire somewhat more closely about him. ^2320

But do not be persuaded by them, for more than forty of their men are lying in ambush for him, who have bound themselves by an oath neither to eat nor drink till they have killed him. And now they are ready, waiting for your consent. ^2321

So the tribune dismissed the young man, charging him, Tell no one that you have informed me of these things. ^2322

Then he called two of the centurions and said, Get ready two hundred soldiers, with seventy horsemen and two hundred spearmen to go as far as Caesarea at the third hour of the night. ^2323

Also provide mounts for Paul to ride and bring him safely to Felix the governor. ^2324

And he wrote a letter to this effect : ^2325

Claudius Lysias, to his Excellency the governor Felix, greetings. ^2326

This man was seized by the Jews and was about to be killed by them when I came upon them with the soldiers and rescued him, having learned that he was a Roman citizen. ^2327

And desiring to know the charge for which they were accusing him, I brought him down to their council. ^2328

I found that he was being accused about questions of their law, but charged with nothing deserving death or imprisonment. ^2329

And when it was disclosed to me that there would be a plot against the man, I sent him to you at once, ordering his accusers also to state before you what they have against him. ^2330

So the soldiers, according to their instructions, took Paul and brought him by night to Antipatris. ^2331

And on the next day they returned to the barracks, letting the horsemen go on with him. ^2332

When they had come to Caesarea and delivered the letter to the governor, they presented Paul also before him. ^2333

On reading the letter, he asked what province he was from. And when he learned that he was from Cilicia, ^2334

he said, I will give you a hearing when your accusers arrive. And he commanded him to be guarded in Herod’s praetorium. ^2335



And after five days the high priest Ananias came down with some elders and a spokesman, one Tertullus. They laid before the governor their case against Paul. ^2401

And when he had been summoned, Tertullus began to accuse him, saying : Since through you we enjoy much peace, and since by your foresight, most excellent Felix, reforms are being made for this nation, ^2402

in every way and everywhere we accept this with all gratitude. ^2403

But, to detain you no further, I beg you in your kindness to hear us briefly. ^2404

For we have found this man a plague, one who stirs up riots among all the Jews throughout the world and is a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes. ^2405

He even tried to profane the temple, but we seized him. ^2406

He even tried to profane the temple, but we seized him. ^2407

By examining him yourself you will be able to find out from him about everything of which we accuse him. ^2408

The Jews also joined in the charge, affirming that all these things were so. ^2409

And when the governor had nodded to him to speak, Paul replied : Knowing that for many years you have been a judge over this nation, I cheerfully make my defense. ^2410

You can verify that it is not more than twelve days since I went up to worship in Jerusalem, ^2411

and they did not find me disputing with anyone or stirring up a crowd, either in the temple or in the synagogues or in the city. ^2412

Neither can they prove to you what they now bring up against me. ^2413

But this I confess to you, that according to the Way, which they call a sect, I worship the God of our fathers, believing everything laid down by the Law and written in the Prophets, ^2414

having a hope in God, which these men themselves accept, that there will be a resurrection of both the just and the unjust. ^2415

So I always take pains to have a clear conscience toward both God and man. ^2416

Now after several years I came to bring alms to my nation and to present offerings. ^2417

While I was doing this, they found me purified in the temple, without any crowd or tumult. But some Jews from Asia — ^2418

they ought to be here before you and to make an accusation, should they have anything against me. ^2419

Or else let these men themselves say what wrongdoing they found when I stood before the council, ^2420

other than this one thing that I cried out while standing among them : It is with respect to the resurrection of the dead that I am on trial before you this day. ^2421

But Felix, having a rather accurate knowledge of the Way, put them off, saying, When Lysias the tribune comes down, I will decide your case. ^2422

Then he gave orders to the centurion that he should be kept in custody but have some liberty, and that none of his friends should be prevented from attending to his needs. ^2423

After some days Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was Jewish, and he sent for Paul and heard him speak about faith in Christ Jesus. ^2424

And as he reasoned about righteousness and self-control and the coming judgment, Felix was alarmed and said, Go away for the present. When I get an opportunity I will summon you. ^2425

At the same time he hoped that money would be given him by Paul. So he sent for him often and conversed with him. ^2426

When two years had elapsed, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus. And desiring to do the Jews a favor, Felix left Paul in prison. ^2427



Now three days after Festus had arrived in the province, he went up to Jerusalem from Caesarea. ^2501

And the chief priests and the principal men of the Jews laid out their case against Paul, and they urged him, ^2502

asking as a favor against Paul that he summon him to Jerusalem —because they were planning an ambush to kill him on the way. ^2503

Festus replied that Paul was being kept at Caesarea and that he himself intended to go there shortly. ^2504

So, said he, let the men of authority among you go down with me, and if there is anything wrong about the man, let them bring charges against him. ^2505

After he stayed among them not more than eight or ten days, he went down to Caesarea. And the next day he took his seat on the tribunal and ordered Paul to be brought. ^2506

When he had arrived, the Jews who had come down from Jerusalem stood around him, bringing many and serious charges against him that they could not prove. ^2507

Paul argued in his defense, Neither against the law of the Jews, nor against the temple, nor against Caesar have I committed any offense. ^2508

But Festus, wishing to do the Jews a favor, said to Paul, Do you wish to go up to Jerusalem and there be tried on these charges before me? ^2509

But Paul said, I am standing before Caesar’s tribunal, where I ought to be tried. To the Jews I have done no wrong, as you yourself know very well. ^2510

If then I am a wrongdoer and have committed anything for which I deserve to die, I do not seek to escape death. But if there is nothing to their charges against me, no one can give me up to them. I appeal to Caesar. ^2511

Then Festus, when he had conferred with his council, answered, To Caesar you have appealed; to Caesar you shall go. ^2512

Now when some days had passed, Agrippa the king and Bernice arrived at Caesarea and greeted Festus. ^2513

And as they stayed there many days, Festus laid Paul’s case before the king, saying, There is a man left prisoner by Felix, ^2514

and when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews laid out their case against him, asking for a sentence of condemnation against him. ^2515

I answered them that it was not the custom of the Romans to give up anyone before the accused met the accusers face to face and had opportunity to make his defense concerning the charge laid against him. ^2516

So when they came together here, I made no delay, but on the next day took my seat on the tribunal and ordered the man to be brought. ^2517

When the accusers stood up, they brought no charge in his case of such evils as I supposed. ^2518

Rather they had certain points of dispute with him about their own religion and about a certain Jesus, who was dead, but whom Paul asserted to be alive. ^2519

Being at a loss how to investigate these questions, I asked whether he wanted to go to Jerusalem and be tried there regarding them. ^2520

But when Paul had appealed to be kept in custody for the decision of the emperor, I ordered him to be held until I could send him to Caesar. ^2521

Then Agrippa said to Festus, I would like to hear the man myself. Tomorrow, said he, you will hear him. ^2522

So on the next day Agrippa and Bernice came with great pomp, and they entered the audience hall with the military tribunes and the prominent men of the city. Then, at the command of Festus, Paul was brought in. ^2523

And Festus said, King Agrippa and all who are present with us, you see this man about whom the whole Jewish people petitioned me, both in Jerusalem and here, shouting that he ought not to live any longer. ^2524

But I found that he had done nothing deserving death. And as he himself appealed to the emperor, I decided to go ahead and send him. ^2525

But I have nothing definite to write to my lord about him. Therefore I have brought him before you all, and especially before you, King Agrippa, so that, after we have examined him, I may have something to write. ^2526

For it seems to me unreasonable, in sending a prisoner, not to indicate the charges against him. ^2527



So Agrippa said to Paul, You have permission to speak for yourself. Then Paul stretched out his hand and made his defense : ^2601

I consider myself fortunate that it is before you, King Agrippa, I am going to make my defense today against all the accusations of the Jews, ^2602

especially because you are familiar with all the customs and controversies of the Jews. Therefore I beg you to listen to me patiently. ^2603

My manner of life from my youth, spent from the beginning among my own nation and in Jerusalem, is known by all the Jews. ^2604

They have known for a long time, if they are willing to testify, that according to the strictest party of our religion I have lived as a Pharisee. ^2605

And now I stand here on trial because of my hope in the promise made by God to our fathers, ^2606

to which our twelve tribes hope to attain, as they earnestly worship night and day. And for this hope I am accused by Jews, O king! ^2607

Why is it thought incredible by any of you that God raises the dead? ^2608

I myself was convinced that I ought to do many things in opposing the name of Jesus of Nazareth. ^2609

And I did so in Jerusalem. I not only locked up many of the saints in prison after receiving authority from the chief priests, but when they were put to death I cast my vote against them. ^2610

And I punished them often in all the synagogues and tried to make them blaspheme, and in raging fury against them I persecuted them even to foreign cities. ^2611

In this connection I journeyed to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests. ^2612

At midday, O king, I saw on the way a light from heaven, brighter than the sun, that shone around me and those who journeyed with me. ^2613

And when we had all fallen to the ground, I heard a voice saying to me in the Hebrew language, Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? It is hard for you to kick against the goads. ^2614

And I said, Who are you, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus whom you are persecuting. ^2615

But rise and stand upon your feet, for I have appeared to you for this purpose, to appoint you as a servant and witness to the things in which you have seen me and to those in which I will appear to you, ^2616

delivering you from your people and from the Gentiles — to whom I am sending you ^2617

to open their eyes, so that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and a place among those who are sanctified by faith in me. ^2618

Therefore, O King Agrippa, I was not disobedient to the heavenly vision, ^2619

but declared first to those in Damascus, then in Jerusalem and throughout all the region of Judea, and also to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, performing deeds in keeping with their repentance. ^2620

For this reason the Jews seized me in the temple and tried to kill me. ^2621

To this day I have had the help that comes from God, and so I stand here testifying both to small and great, saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses said would come to pass : ^2622

that the Christ must suffer and that, by being the first to rise from the dead, he would proclaim light both to our people and to the Gentiles. ^2623

And as he was saying these things in his defense, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, you are out of your mind; your great learning is driving you out of your mind. ^2624

But Paul said, I am not out of my mind, most excellent Festus, but I am speaking true and rational words. ^2625

For the king knows about these things, and to him I speak boldly. For I am persuaded that none of these things has escaped his notice, for this has not been done in a corner. ^2626

King Agrippa, do you believe the prophets? I know that you believe. ^2627

And Agrippa said to Paul, In a short time would you persuade me to be a Christian? ^2628

And Paul said, Whether short or long, I would to God that not only you but also all who hear me this day might become such as I am — except for these chains. ^2629

Then the king rose, and the governor and Bernice and those who were sitting with them. ^2630

And when they had withdrawn, they said to one another, This man is doing nothing to deserve death or imprisonment. ^2631

And Agrippa said to Festus, This man could have been set free if he had not appealed to Caesar. ^2632



And when it was decided that we should sail for Italy, they delivered Paul and some other prisoners to a centurion of the Augustan Cohort named Julius. ^2701

And embarking in a ship of Adramyttium, which was about to sail to the ports along the coast of Asia, we put to sea, accompanied by Aristarchus, a Macedonian from Thessalonica. ^2702

The next day we put in at Sidon. And Julius treated Paul kindly and gave him leave to go to his friends and be cared for. ^2703

And putting out to sea from there we sailed under the lee of Cyprus, because the winds were against us. ^2704

And when we had sailed across the open sea along the coast of Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra in Lycia. ^2705

There the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing for Italy and put us on board. ^2706

We sailed slowly for a number of days and arrived with difficulty off Cnidus, and as the wind did not allow us to go farther, we sailed under the lee of Crete off Salmone. ^2707

Coasting along it with difficulty, we came to a place called Fair Havens, near which was the city of Lasea. ^2708

Since much time had passed, and the voyage was now dangerous because even the Fast was already over, Paul advised them, ^2709

saying, Sirs, I perceive that the voyage will be with injury and much loss, not only of the cargo and the ship, but also of our lives. ^2710

But the centurion paid more attention to the pilot and to the owner of the ship than to what Paul said. ^2711

And because the harbor was not suitable to spend the winter in, the majority decided to put out to sea from there, on the chance that somehow they could reach Phoenix, a harbor of Crete, facing both southwest and northwest, and spend the winter there. ^2712

Now when the south wind blew gently, supposing that they had obtained their purpose, they weighed anchor and sailed along Crete, close to the shore. ^2713

But soon a tempestuous wind, called the northeaster, struck down from the land. ^2714

And when the ship was caught and could not face the wind, we gave way to it and were driven along. ^2715

Running under the lee of a small island called Cauda, we managed with difficulty to secure the ship’s boat. ^2716

After hoisting it up, they used supports to undergird the ship. Then, fearing that they would run aground on the Syrtis, they lowered the gear, and thus they were driven along. ^2717

Since we were violently storm-tossed, they began the next day to jettison the cargo. ^2718

And on the third day they threw the ship’s tackle overboard with their own hands. ^2719

When neither sun nor stars appeared for many days, and no small tempest lay on us, all hope of our being saved was at last abandoned. ^2720

Since they had been without food for a long time, Paul stood up among them and said, Men, you should have listened to me and not have set sail from Crete and incurred this injury and loss. ^2721

Yet now I urge you to take heart, for there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship. ^2722

For this very night there stood before me an angel of the God to whom I belong and whom I worship, ^2723

and he said, Do not be afraid, Paul; you must stand before Caesar. And behold, God has granted you all those who sail with you. ^2724

So take heart, men, for I have faith in God that it will be exactly as I have been told. ^2725

But we must run aground on some island. ^2726

When the fourteenth night had come, as we were being driven across the Adriatic Sea, about midnight the sailors suspected that they were nearing land. ^2727

So they took a sounding and found twenty fathoms. A little farther on they took a sounding again and found fifteen fathoms. ^2728

And fearing that we might run on the rocks, they let down four anchors from the stern and prayed for day to come. ^2729

And as the sailors were seeking to escape from the ship, and had lowered the ship’s boat into the sea under pretense of laying out anchors from the bow, ^2730

Paul said to the centurion and the soldiers, Unless these men stay in the ship, you cannot be saved. ^2731

Then the soldiers cut away the ropes of the ship’s boat and let it go. ^2732

As day was about to dawn, Paul urged them all to take some food, saying, Today is the fourteenth day that you have continued in suspense and without food, having taken nothing. ^2733

Therefore I urge you to take some food. For it will give you strength, for not a hair is to perish from the head of any of you. ^2734

And when he had said these things, he took bread, and giving thanks to God in the presence of all he broke it and began to eat. ^2735

Then they all were encouraged and ate some food themselves. ^2736

( We were in all 276 persons in the ship .) ^2737

And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, throwing out the wheat into the sea. ^2738

Now when it was day, they did not recognize the land, but they noticed a bay with a beach, on which they planned if possible to run the ship ashore. ^2739

So they cast off the anchors and left them in the sea, at the same time loosening the ropes that tied the rudders. Then hoisting the foresail to the wind they made for the beach. ^2740

But striking a reef, they ran the vessel aground. The bow stuck and remained immovable, and the stern was being broken up by the surf. ^2741

The soldiers ’ plan was to kill the prisoners, lest any should swim away and escape. ^2742

But the centurion, wishing to save Paul, kept them from carrying out their plan. He ordered those who could swim to jump overboard first and make for the land, ^2743

and the rest on planks or on pieces of the ship. And so it was that all were brought safely to land. ^2744



After we were brought safely through, we then learned that the island was called Malta. ^2801

The native people showed us unusual kindness, for they kindled a fire and welcomed us all, because it had begun to rain and was cold. ^2802

When Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks and put them on the fire, a viper came out because of the heat and fastened on his hand. ^2803

When the native people saw the creature hanging from his hand, they said to one another, No doubt this man is a murderer. Though he has escaped from the sea, Justice has not allowed him to live. ^2804

He, however, shook off the creature into the fire and suffered no harm. ^2805

They were waiting for him to swell up or suddenly fall down dead. But when they had waited a long time and saw no misfortune come to him, they changed their minds and said that he was a god. ^2806

Now in the neighborhood of that place were lands belonging to the chief man of the island, named Publius, who received us and entertained us hospitably for three days. ^2807

It happened that the father of Publius lay sick with fever and dysentery. And Paul visited him and prayed, and putting his hands on him healed him. ^2808

And when this had taken place, the rest of the people on the island who had diseases also came and were cured. ^2809

They also honored us greatly, and when we were about to sail, they put on board whatever we needed. ^2810

After three months we set sail in a ship that had wintered in the island, a ship of Alexandria, with the twin gods as a figurehead. ^2811

Putting in at Syracuse, we stayed there for three days. ^2812

And from there we made a circuit and arrived at Rhegium. And after one day a south wind sprang up, and on the second day we came to Puteoli. ^2813

There we found brothers and were invited to stay with them for seven days. And so we came to Rome. ^2814

And the brothers there, when they heard about us, came as far as the Forum of Appius and Three Taverns to meet us. On seeing them, Paul thanked God and took courage. ^2815

And when we came into Rome, Paul was allowed to stay by himself, with the soldier who guarded him. ^2816

After three days he called together the local leaders of the Jews, and when they had gathered, he said to them, Brothers, though I had done nothing against our people or the customs of our fathers, yet I was delivered as a prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans. ^2817

When they had examined me, they wished to set me at liberty, because there was no reason for the death penalty in my case. ^2818

But because the Jews objected, I was compelled to appeal to Caesar — though I had no charge to bring against my nation. ^2819

For this reason, therefore, I have asked to see you and speak with you, since it is because of the hope of Israel that I am wearing this chain. ^2820

And they said to him, We have received no letters from Judea about you, and none of the brothers coming here has reported or spoken any evil about you. ^2821

But we desire to hear from you what your views are, for with regard to this sect we know that everywhere it is spoken against. ^2822

When they had appointed a day for him, they came to him at his lodging in greater numbers. From morning till evening he expounded to them, testifying to the kingdom of God and trying to convince them about Jesus both from the Law of Moses and from the Prophets. ^2823

And some were convinced by what he said, but others disbelieved. ^2824

And disagreeing among themselves, they departed after Paul had made one statement : The Holy Spirit was right in saying to your fathers through Isaiah the prophet : ^2825

Go to this people, and say, You will indeed hear but never understand, and you will indeed see but never perceive. ^2826

For this people’s heart has grown dull, and with their ears they can barely hear, and their eyes they have closed; lest they should see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their heart and turn, and I would heal them. ^2827

Therefore let it be known to you that this salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles; they will listen. ^2828

Therefore let it be known to you that this salvation of God has been sent to the Gentiles; they will listen. ^2829

He lived there two whole years at his own expense, and welcomed all who came to him, ^2830

proclaiming the kingdom of God and teaching about the Lord Jesus Christ with all boldness and without hindrance. ^2831
