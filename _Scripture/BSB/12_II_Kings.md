[[H274|Now Ahaziah]] [[H5307|had fallen]] [[H1157|through]] [[H7639|the lattice]] [[H5944|of his upper room]] [[H8111|in Samaria]] [[H2470|and injured himself.]] [[H7971|So he sent]] [[H4397|messengers]] [[H559|and instructed them:]] [[H1980|“Go]] [[H1875|inquire]] [[H1176|of Baal-zebub,]] [[H430|the god]] [[H6138|of Ekron,]] [[H518|whether]] [[H2421|I will recover]] [[H2088|from this]] [[H2483|injury.”]] ^0102

[[H4397|But the angel]] [[H3068|of the LORD]] [[H1696|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H452|Elijah]] [[H8664|the Tishbite,]] [[H5927|“Go up]] [[H7125|to meet]] [[H4397|the messengers]] [[H4428|of the king]] [[H8111|of Samaria]] [[H1696|and ask them,]] [[H1097|‘ because]] ⟨Is [it⟩ ⟨there is⟩ [[H369|no]] [[H430|God]] [[H3478|in Israel]] [[H859|that you]] [[H1980|are on your way]] [[H1875|to inquire]] [[H1176|of Baal-zebub,]] [[H430|the god]] [[H6138|of Ekron?]] ^0103

[[H3651|Therefore,]] [[H3541|this is what]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H559|says:]] [[H3808|‘You will not]] [[H3381|get up]] [[H4480|from]] [[H4296|the bed]] [[H834|on which]] [[H5927|you are lying.]] [[H4191|You will surely die.’”]] [[H452|So Elijah]] [[H1980|departed.]] ^0104

[[H4397|When the messengers]] [[H7725|returned]] [[H413|to the king,]] [[H559|he asked them,]] [[H4100|“Why]] [[H7725|have you returned?”]] ^0105

[[H559|They replied,]] [[H376|“A man]] [[H5927|came up]] [[H7125|to meet us]] [[H559|and said,]] [[H1980|‘Go]] [[H7725|back]] [[H413|to]] [[H4428|the king]] [[H834|who]] [[H7971|sent]] [[H853|you]] [[H1696|and tell]] [[H413|him]] [[H3541|that this is what]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H559|says:]] [[H4480|Is it because]] [[H1097|there is no]] [[H430|God]] [[H3478|in Israel]] [[H859|that you are]] [[H7971|sending]] [[H1875|these men to inquire]] [[H1176|of Baal-zebub,]] [[H430|the god]] [[H6138|of Ekron?]] [[H3651|Therefore]] [[H3808|you will not]] [[H3381|get up]] [[H4296|from the bed]] [[H834|on which]] [[H5927|you are lying.]] [[H4191|You will surely die.]] ^0106

[[H1696|The king asked them,]] [[H4100|“What]] [[H4941|sort]] [[H376|of man]] [[H5927|came up]] [[H7125|to meet]] [[H1696|you and spoke]] [[H428|these]] [[H1697|words]] [[H413|to you?”]] ^0107

[[H8181|“ a hairy]] ⟨He was⟩ [[H376|man,”]] [[H559|they answered,]] [[H5785|“with a leather]] [[H232|belt]] [[H4975|around his waist.”]] [[H1931|“It is]] [[H452|Elijah]] [[H8664|the Tishbite,”]] [[H559|said]] ⟨the king⟩. ^0108

[[H7971|Then King Ahaziah sent]] [[H413|to Elijah]] [[H8269|a captain]] [[H2572|with his company of fifty men.]] [[H5927|So the captain went up]] [[H413|to]] ⟨Elijah⟩, [[H3427|who was sitting]] [[H5921|on]] [[H7218|top]] [[H2022|of a hill,]] [[H1696|and said]] [[H413|to him,]] [[H376|“Man]] [[H430|of God,]] [[H4428|the king]] [[H1696|declares,]] [[H3381|‘Come down!’”]] ^0109

[[H7971|So the king sent]] [[H413|to Elijah]] [[H312|another]] [[H8269|captain]] ⟨with his⟩ [[H2572|fifty]] ⟨men⟩. [[H6030|And]] ⟨the captain⟩ [[H1696|said]] [[H413|to]] ⟨Elijah⟩, [[H376|“Man]] [[H430|of God,]] [[H4428|the king]] [[H559|declares,]] [[H3381|‘Come down]] [[H4120|at once!’”]] ^0111

[[H452|Again Elijah]] [[H6030|replied,]] [[H518|“If]] [[H589|I]] [[H376|am a man]] [[H430|of God,]] [[H784|may fire]] [[H3381|come down]] [[H4480|from]] [[H8064|heaven]] [[H398|and consume]] [[H853|you]] [[H853|and]] ⟨your⟩ [[H2572|fifty.”]] ⟨men⟩ [[H784|And the fire]] [[H430|of God]] [[H3381|came down]] [[H4480|from]] [[H8064|heaven]] [[H398|and consumed]] [[H853|him]] [[H853|and]] ⟨his⟩ [[H2572|fifty men.]] ^0112

[[H7725|So]] [[H7971|the king sent]] [[H7992|a third]] [[H8269|captain]] [[H2572|with his fifty men.]] [[H7992|And the third]] [[H8269|captain]] [[H5927|went up,]] [[H3766|fell]] [[H5921|on]] [[H1290|his knees]] [[H5048|before]] [[H452|Elijah,]] [[H2603|and begged him,]] [[H376|“Man]] [[H430|of God,]] [[H5315|may my life]] [[H5315|and the lives]] [[H428|of these]] [[H2572|fifty]] [[H5650|servants]] [[H4994|please]] [[H3365|be precious]] [[H5869|in your sight.]] ^0113

[[H2009|Behold,]] [[H784|fire]] [[H3381|has come down]] [[H4480|from]] [[H8064|heaven]] [[H398|and consumed]] [[H7223|the first]] [[H8147|two]] [[H8269|captains]] [[H2572|of fifty,]] [[H2572|with all their men.]] [[H6258|But now]] [[H5315|may my life]] [[H3365|be precious]] [[H5869|in your sight.”]] ^0114

[[H4397|Then the angel]] [[H3069|of the LORD]] [[H1696|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H452|Elijah,]] [[H3381|“Go down]] [[H854|with him.]] [[H408|Do not]] [[H3372|be afraid]] [[H6440|of him.”]] [[H6965|So arose]] ⟨Elijah⟩ [[H3381|and went down]] [[H854|with him]] [[H413|to]] [[H4428|the king.]] ^0115

[[H1696|And Elijah said]] [[H413|to King Ahaziah,]] [[H3541|“This is what]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H559|says:]] [[H1097|‘Is there really no]] [[H430|God]] [[H3478|in Israel]] [[H1875|for you to inquire]] [[H1697|of His word?]] [[H3282|Is that why]] [[H7971|you have sent]] [[H4397|messengers]] [[H1875|to inquire]] [[H1176|of  Baal-zebub,]] [[H430|the god]] [[H6138|of Ekron?]] [[H3651|Therefore]] [[H3808|you will not]] [[H3381|get up from]] [[H4296|the bed]] [[H834|on which]] [[H5927|you are lying.]] [[H4191|You will surely die.]] ^0116

[[H4191|So died]] ⟨Ahaziah⟩ [[H1697|according to the word]] [[H3068|of the LORD]] [[H834|that]] [[H452|Elijah]] [[H1696|had spoken.]] [[H3588|Since]] [[H1961|he had]] [[H3808|no]] [[H1121|son,]] [[H3088|Jehoram]] [[H4427|succeeded him]] [[H8147|in the second]] [[H8141|year]] [[H4428|of the reign]] [[H3088|of Jehoram]] [[H1121|son]] [[H3092|of Jehoshaphat]] [[H3063|over Judah.]] ^0117

[[H3499|As for the rest]] [[H1697|of the acts]] [[H274|of Ahaziah,]] [[H834|along with his accomplishments,]] [[H1992|are they]] [[H3808|not]] [[H3789|written]] [[H5921|in]] [[H5612|the Book]] [[H1697|of the Chronicles]] [[H4428|of the Kings]] [[H3478|of Israel?]] ^0118



[[H1961|Shortly before]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H5927|took]] [[H452|Elijah]] [[H8064|up to heaven]] [[H5591|in a whirlwind,]] [[H452|Elijah]] [[H477|and Elisha]] [[H1980|were on their way]] [[H4480|from]] [[H1537|Gilgal,]] ^0201

[[H452|and Elijah]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H477|Elisha,]] [[H4994|“Please]] [[H3427|stay]] [[H6311|here,]] [[H3588|for]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H7971|has sent me]] [[H5704|on to]] [[H1008|Bethel.”]] [[H477|But Elisha]] [[H559|replied,]] [[H3068|“As surely as the LORD]] [[H2416|lives]] [[H5315|and as you yourself]] [[H2416|live,]] [[H518|I will not]] [[H5800|leave you.”]] [[H3381|So they went down]] [[H1008|to  Bethel.]] ^0202

[[H1121|Then the sons]] [[H5030|of the prophets]] [[H1008|at  Bethel]] [[H3318|came out]] [[H413|to]] [[H477|Elisha]] [[H559|and said,]] [[H3045|“Do you know]] [[H3588|that]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H3947|will take]] [[H113|your master]] [[H5921|away from]] [[H7218|you]] [[H3117|today?”]] [[H1571|“Yes,]] [[H589|I]] [[H3045|know,”]] [[H559|he replied.]] [[H2814|“Do not speak.”]] ⟨of it⟩ ^0203

[[H452|And Elijah]] [[H559|said to]] [[H477|Elisha,]] [[H4994|“Please]] [[H3427|stay]] [[H6311|here,]] [[H3588|for]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H7971|has sent me]] [[H3405|on to Jericho.”]] [[H559|But Elisha replied,]] [[H3068|“As surely as the LORD]] [[H2416|lives]] [[H5315|and as you yourself]] [[H2416|live,]] [[H518|I will not]] [[H5800|leave you.”]] [[H935|So they went]] [[H3405|to Jericho.]] ^0204

[[H1121|Then the sons]] [[H5030|of the prophets]] [[H3405|at Jericho]] [[H5066|came up]] [[H413|to]] [[H477|Elisha]] [[H559|and said,]] [[H3045|“Do you know]] [[H3588|that]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H3947|will take]] [[H113|your master]] [[H5921|away from]] [[H7218|you]] [[H3117|today?”]] [[H1571|“Yes,]] [[H589|I]] [[H3045|know,”]] [[H559|he replied.]] [[H2814|“Do not speak.”]] ⟨of it⟩ ^0205

[[H452|And Elijah]] [[H559|said]] [[H4994|to,  “Please]] ⟨Elisha⟩ [[H3427|stay]] [[H6311|here,]] [[H3588|for]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H7971|has sent me]] [[H3383|on to the Jordan.”]] [[H559|But Elisha replied,]] [[H3068|“As surely as the LORD]] [[H2416|lives]] [[H5315|and as you]] [[H2416|yourself live,]] [[H518|I will not]] [[H5800|leave you.”]] [[H8147|So the two of them]] [[H1980|went on.]] ^0206

[[H582|Then a company]] [[H2572|of fifty]] [[H1121|of the sons]] [[H5030|of the prophets]] [[H1980|went]] [[H5975|and stood]] [[H5048|at a distance,]] [[H7350|facing]] ⟨Elijah and Elisha⟩ [[H8147|as the two]] [[H5975|of them stood]] [[H5921|by]] [[H3383|the Jordan.]] ^0207

[[H452|And Elijah]] [[H3947|took]] [[H155|his cloak,]] [[H1563|rolled it up,]] [[H5221|and struck]] [[H4325|the waters,]] [[H2673|which parted]] [[H2008|to the right]] [[H2008|and to the left,]] [[H8147|so that the two]] [[H5674|of them crossed over]] [[H2724|on dry ground.]] ^0208

[[H1961|After]] [[H5674|they had crossed over,]] [[H452|Elijah]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H477|Elisha,]] [[H7592|“Tell me,]] [[H4100|what]] [[H6213|can I do]] [[H2962|for you  before]] [[H3947|I am taken away]] [[H5973|from you?”]] [[H4994|“Please,]] [[H1961|let]] [[H413|me inherit]] [[H8147|a double]] [[H6310|portion]] [[H7307|of your spirit,”]] [[H477|Elisha]] [[H559|replied.]] ^0209

[[H1992|As they]] [[H1980|were walking along]] [[H1696|and talking together,]] [[H2009|suddenly]] [[H7393|a chariot]] [[H784|of fire]] [[H5483|with horses]] [[H784|of fire]] [[H6504|appeared and separated]] [[H8147|the two of them,]] [[H452|and Elijah]] [[H5927|went up]] [[H8064|into heaven]] [[H5591|in a whirlwind.]] ^0211

[[H477|As Elisha]] [[H7200|watched,]] [[H1931|he]] [[H6817|cried out,]] [[H1|“My father,]] [[H1|my father,]] [[H7393|the chariots]] [[H6571|and horsemen]] [[H3478|of Israel!”]] [[H7200|And he saw]] ⟨Elijah⟩ [[H3808|no]] [[H5750|more.]] [[H2388|So taking hold]] [[H899|of his own clothes,]] [[H7167|he tore them]] [[H8147|in two.]] ^0212

[[H7311|Elisha also picked up]] [[H155|the cloak]] [[H834|that]] [[H5307|had fallen]] [[H5921|from]] [[H452|Elijah,]] [[H7725|and he went back]] [[H5975|and stood]] [[H5921|on]] [[H8193|the bank]] [[H3383|of the Jordan.]] ^0213

[[H3947|Then he took]] [[H155|the cloak]] [[H452|of Elijah]] [[H834|that]] [[H5307|had fallen]] [[H5921|from him]] [[H5221|and struck]] [[H4325|the waters.]] [[H346|“Where now]] ⟨is⟩ [[H3068|the LORD,]] [[H430|the God]] [[H452|of Elijah?”]] [[H559|he asked.]] [[H5221|And when he had struck]] [[H4325|the waters,]] [[H2673|they parted]] [[H2008|to the right]] [[H2008|and to the left,]] [[H477|and Elisha]] [[H5674|crossed over.]] ^0214

[[H1121|When the sons]] [[H5030|of the prophets]] [[H834|who]] ⟨were⟩ [[H5048|facing him]] [[H3405|from Jericho]] [[H7200|saw what had happened,]] [[H559|they said,]] [[H7307|“The spirit]] [[H452|of Elijah]] [[H5117|rests]] [[H5921|on]] [[H477|Elisha.”]] [[H935|And they went]] [[H7125|to meet him]] [[H7812|and bowed down]] [[H776|to the ground]] ^0215

[[H2009|“Look]] [[H4994|now,”]] [[H559|they said]] [[H413|to Elisha,]] [[H5650|“we your servants]] [[H3426|have]] [[H2572|fifty]] [[H2428|valiant]] [[H376|men.]] [[H4994|Please]] [[H1980|let them go]] [[H1245|and search for]] [[H113|your master.]] [[H6435|Perhaps]] [[H7307|the Spirit]] [[H3068|of the LORD]] [[H5375|has taken him up]] [[H7993|and put him]] [[H259|on one]] [[H2022|of the mountains]] [[H176|or]] [[H259|in one]] [[H1516|of the valleys.”]] [[H3808|“Do not]] [[H7971|send them,”]] ⟨Elisha⟩ [[H559|replied.]] ^0216

[[H6484|But when they pressed]] [[H5704|him  to the point of]] [[H954|embarrassment,]] [[H559|he said,]] [[H7971|“Send.”]] ⟨them⟩ [[H7971|And they sent]] [[H2572|fifty]] [[H376|men,]] [[H1245|who searched for]] [[H7969|three]] [[H3117|days]] [[H3808|but did not]] [[H4672|find]] ⟨Elijah⟩. ^0217

[[H7725|When they returned]] [[H413|to]] ⟨Elisha⟩, [[H1931|who]] [[H3427|was staying]] [[H3405|in Jericho,]] [[H559|he said]] [[H413|to them,]] [[H3808|“Didn't]] [[H559|I tell]] [[H413|you]] [[H408|not]] [[H1980|to go?”]] ^0218

[[H376|Then the men]] [[H5892|of the city]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H477|Elisha,]] [[H4994|“Please]] [[H2009|note,]] [[H113|our lord,]] [[H5892|that the city’s]] [[H4186|location]] [[H2896|is good,]] [[H4325|but the water]] ⟨is⟩ [[H7451|bad]] [[H776|and the land]] [[H7921|is unfruitful.”]] ^0219

[[H3947|“Bring]] [[H2319|me  a new]] [[H6746|bowl,”]] [[H559|he replied,]] [[H7760|“and put]] [[H4417|some salt]] [[H8033|in it.”]] [[H3947|So they brought]] ⟨it⟩ [[H413|to him,]] ^0220

[[H1931|So at that]] [[H3117|time]] [[H4428|King]] [[H3088|Jehoram]] [[H3318|set out]] [[H8111|from Samaria]] [[H6485|and mobilized]] [[H3605|all]] [[H3478|Israel.]] ^0306

[[H7971|And he sent]] [[H413|a message to]] [[H4428|King]] [[H3092|Jehoshaphat]] [[H3063|of Judah:]] [[H4428|“The king]] [[H4124|of Moab]] [[H6586|has rebelled]] [[H1980|against me.  Will you go]] [[H854|with me]] [[H4421|to fight]] [[H413|against]] [[H4124|Moab?”]] [[H5927|“I will go,”]] [[H559|replied Jehoshaphat.]] [[H3644|“I]] ⟨am⟩ [[H3644|as you]] ⟨are⟩, [[H5971|my people]] [[H5971|as your people,]] [[H5483|my horses]] [[H5483|as your horses.”]] ^0307

[[H559|Then he asked,]] [[H335|“Which]] [[H1870|way]] [[H5927|shall we go up?”]] [[H1870|“By way]] [[H4057|of the Desert]] [[H123|of Edom,”]] [[H559|replied Joram.]] ^0308

[[H4428|So the king]] [[H3478|of Israel,]] [[H4428|the king]] [[H3063|of Judah,]] [[H4428|and the king]] [[H123|of Edom]] [[H1980|set out,]] [[H5437|and after they had traveled a roundabout]] [[H1870|route]] [[H7651|for seven]] [[H3117|days,]] [[H3808|they had no]] [[H4325|water]] [[H4264|for their army]] [[H834|or for their]] [[H929|animals.]] ^0309

[[H162|“Alas,”]] [[H559|said]] [[H4428|the king]] [[H3478|of Israel,]] [[H3588|“for]] [[H3069|the LORD]] [[H7121|has summoned]] [[H428|these]] [[H7969|three]] [[H4428|kings]] [[H5414|to deliver]] [[H853|them]] [[H3027|into the hand]] [[H4124|of Moab!”]] ^0310

[[H3092|But Jehoshaphat]] [[H559|asked,]] [[H369|“Is there no]] [[H5030|prophet]] [[H3068|of the LORD]] [[H6311|here?]] [[H1875|Let us inquire]] [[H3068|of the LORD]] [[H854|through him.”]] [[H259|And one]] [[H5650|of the servants]] [[H4428|of the king]] [[H3478|of Israel]] [[H6030|answered,]] [[H477|“Elisha]] [[H1121|son]] [[H8202|of Shaphat]] [[H6311|is here.]] ⟨He⟩ [[H834|]] [[H3332|used to pour]] [[H4325|water]] [[H5921|on]] [[H3027|the hands]] [[H452|of Elijah.”]] ^0311

[[H3092|Jehoshaphat]] [[H559|affirmed,]] [[H1697|“The word]] [[H3068|of the LORD]] [[H3426|is]] [[H854|with him.”]] [[H4428|So the king]] [[H3478|of Israel]] [[H3092|and Jehoshaphat]] [[H4428|and the king]] [[H123|of Edom]] [[H3381|went down]] [[H413|to him.]] ^0312

[[H477|Elisha, however,]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H4428|the king]] [[H3478|of Israel,]] [[H4100|“What have we to do]] [[H1980|with?  Go]] ⟨each other⟩ [[H413|to]] [[H5030|the prophets]] [[H1|of your father]] [[H413|and]] [[H517|of your mother!”]] [[H408|“No,”]] [[H559|replied]] [[H4428|the king]] [[H3478|of Israel,]] [[H3588|“for]] [[H3068|it is the LORD]] [[H7121|who has summoned]] [[H428|these]] [[H7969|three]] [[H4428|kings]] [[H5414|to deliver]] [[H853|them]] [[H3027|into the hand]] [[H4124|of Moab.”]] ^0313

[[H477|Then Elisha]] [[H559|said,]] [[H3068|“As surely as the LORD]] [[H6635|of Hosts]] [[H2416|lives,]] [[H6440|before]] [[H834|whom]] [[H5975|I stand,]] [[H3884|were it not]] [[H5375|for my regard]] [[H6440|for the presence]] [[H3092|of Jehoshaphat]] [[H4428|king]] [[H3063|of Judah,]] [[H518|I would not]] [[H5027|look]] [[H413|at you]] [[H518|or]] [[H7200|acknowledge you.]] ^0314

[[H6258|But now,]] [[H3947|bring]] [[H5059|me  a harpist.”]] [[H5059|And while the harpist]] [[H5059|played,]] [[H3027|the hand]] [[H3068|of the LORD]] [[H1961|came]] [[H5921|upon Elisha]] ^0315

[[H559|and he said,]] [[H3541|“This is what]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H559|says:]] [[H6213|‘Dig]] [[H2088|this]] [[H5158|valley]] [[H1356|full of ditches.’]] ^0316

[[H3588|For]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H559|says,]] [[H3808|‘You will not]] [[H7200|see]] [[H7307|wind]] [[H1653|or rain,]] [[H1931|but the]] [[H5158|valley]] [[H4390|will be filled]] [[H4325|with water,]] [[H8354|and you will drink—]] [[H859|you]] [[H4735|and your cattle]] [[H929|and your animals.’]] ^0317

[[H2063|This]] [[H7043|is a simple matter]] [[H5869|in the sight]] [[H3068|of the LORD,]] [[H5414|and He will also deliver]] [[H4124|the Moabites]] [[H3027|into your hand.]] ^0318

[[H5221|And you shall attack]] [[H3605|every]] [[H4013|fortified]] [[H5892|city]] [[H3605|and every]] [[H5892|city]] [[H4004|of importance.]] [[H5307|You shall cut down]] [[H3605|every]] [[H2896|good]] [[H6086|tree,]] [[H5640|stop up]] [[H3605|every]] [[H4599|spring,]] [[H3510|and ruin]] [[H3605|every]] [[H2896|good]] [[H2513|field]] [[H68|with stones.”]] ^0319

[[H1242|The next morning,]] [[H5927|at the time of the morning sacrifice,]] [[H4325|water]] [[H2009|suddenly]] [[H935|flowed]] [[H1870|from the direction]] [[H123|of Edom]] [[H4390|and filled]] [[H776|the land.]] ^0320

[[H3605|Now all]] [[H4124|the Moabites]] [[H8085|had heard]] [[H3588|that]] [[H4428|the kings]] [[H5927|had come up]] [[H3898|to fight against them.]] [[H3605|So all]] [[H2296|who could bear arms,]] ⟨young⟩ [[H4605|and old,]] [[H6817|were summoned]] [[H5975|and stationed]] [[H5921|at]] [[H1366|the border.]] ^0321

[[H7925|When they got up early]] [[H1242|in the morning,]] [[H8121|the sun]] [[H2224|was shining]] [[H5921|on]] [[H4325|the water,]] [[H4325|and]] ⟨it⟩ [[H7200|looked]] ⟨as⟩ [[H122|red]] [[H1818|as blood]] [[H4124|to the Moabites]] [[H5048|across the way.]] ^0322

[[H2088|“This]] [[H1818|is blood!”]] [[H559|they exclaimed.]] [[H4428|“The kings]] [[H2717|have clashed swords]] [[H5221|and slaughtered]] [[H376|each]] [[H7453|other.]] [[H6258|Now]] [[H7998|to the plunder,]] [[H4124|Moab!”]] ^0323

[[H935|But when the Moabites came]] [[H413|to]] [[H4264|the camp]] [[H3478|of Israel,]] [[H3478|the Israelites]] [[H6965|rose up]] [[H5221|and attacked]] [[H4124|them,]] [[H5127|and they fled]] [[H6440|before them.]] [[H935|So invaded land]] ⟨the Israelites⟩ ⟨their⟩ [[H5221|and struck down]] [[H4124|the Moabites.]] ^0324

[[H2040|They destroyed]] [[H5892|the cities,]] [[H376|and each man]] [[H7993|threw]] [[H68|stones]] [[H3605|on every]] [[H2896|good]] [[H2513|field]] [[H4390|until it was covered.]] [[H5640|They stopped up]] [[H3605|every]] [[H4599|spring]] [[H5307|and cut down]] [[H3605|every]] [[H2896|good]] [[H6086|tree.]] [[H5704|Only]] [[H7025|Kir-haraseth]] [[H7604|was left]] [[H68|with stones in place,]] [[H7051|but men with slings]] [[H5437|surrounded it]] [[H5221|and attacked it]] ⟨as well⟩. ^0325

[[H4428|When the king]] [[H4124|of Moab]] [[H7200|saw]] [[H3588|that]] [[H4421|the battle]] [[H2388|was too fierce]] [[H4480|for him,]] [[H3947|he took]] [[H854|with him]] [[H7651|seven]] [[H3967|hundred]] [[H376|swordsmen]] [[H1234|to break through]] [[H413|to]] [[H4428|the king]] [[H123|of Edom,]] [[H3201|but they could not prevail.]] ^0326

[[H3947|So he took]] [[H1060|his firstborn]] [[H1121|son,]] [[H834|who]] [[H4427|was to succeed him,]] [[H5927|and offered]] [[H5930|him as a burnt offering]] [[H5921|on]] [[H2346|the city wall.]] [[H1961|And there was]] [[H1419|great]] [[H7110|fury]] [[H5921|against]] [[H3478|the Israelites,]] [[H5265|so they withdrew]] [[H7725|and returned]] [[H776|to land.]] ⟨their own⟩ ^0327

[[H802|Now the wife]] [[H259|of one]] [[H1121|of the sons]] [[H5030|of the prophets]] [[H6817|cried out]] [[H413|to]] [[H477|Elisha,]] [[H5650|“Your servant,]] [[H376|my husband,]] [[H4191|is dead,]] [[H859|and you]] [[H3045|know]] [[H3588|that]] [[H5650|your servant]] [[H3372|feared]] [[H3068|the LORD.]] [[H5383|And now his creditor]] [[H935|is coming]] [[H3947|to take]] [[H8147|my two]] [[H3206|children]] [[H5650|as his slaves!]] ^0401

[[H4100|“How]] [[H6213|can I]] [[H559|help you?”  asked]] [[H477|Elisha.]] [[H5046|“Tell me,]] [[H4100|what]] [[H3426|do you have]] [[H1004|in the house?”]] [[H559|She answered,]] [[H8198|“Your servant]] [[H369|has nothing]] [[H1004|in the house]] [[H518|but]] [[H610|a jar]] [[H8081|of oil.”]] ^0402

[[H1980|“Go,”]] [[H559|said]] ⟨Elisha⟩, [[H7592|“borrow]] [[H7386|empty]] [[H3627|jars]] [[H4480|from]] [[H3605|all]] [[H7934|your neighbors.]] [[H408|Do not]] [[H4591|gather just a few.]] ^0403

[[H935|Then go inside,]] [[H5462|shut]] [[H1817|the door]] [[H1157|behind you]] [[H1157|and]] [[H1121|your sons,]] [[H3332|and pour]] [[H5921|oil into]] [[H3605|all]] [[H428|these]] [[H3627|jars,]] [[H4392|setting the full ones]] [[H5265|aside.”]] ^0404

[[H1980|So she left]] [[H853|him,]] [[H5462|and after she had shut]] [[H1817|the door]] [[H1157|behind her]] [[H1157|and]] [[H1121|her sons,]] [[H1992|they]] [[H5066|kept bringing]] ⟨jars⟩ [[H413|to her,]] [[H1931|and she]] [[H3332|kept pouring.]] ^0405

[[H1961|When]] [[H3627|all the jars]] [[H4390|were full,]] [[H559|she said]] [[H413|to]] [[H1121|her son,]] [[H5066|“Bring]] [[H5750|me another.”]] [[H559|But he replied,]] [[H369|“There are no]] [[H5750|more]] [[H3627|jars.”]] [[H8081|Then the oil]] [[H5975|stopped flowing.]] ^0406

[[H935|She went]] [[H5046|and told]] [[H376|the man]] [[H430|of God,]] [[H559|and he said,]] [[H1980|“Go,]] [[H4376|sell]] [[H8081|the oil]] [[H7999|and pay]] [[H5386|your debt,]] [[H859|and you]] [[H1121|and your sons]] [[H2421|can live]] [[H3498|on the remainder.”]] ^0407

[[H3117|One day]] [[H477|Elisha]] [[H5674|went]] [[H413|to]] [[H7766|Shunem,]] [[H1419|and a prominent]] [[H802|woman]] [[H8033|who lived there]] [[H2388|persuaded]] [[H398|him  to have a meal.]] [[H1961|So whenever]] [[H5674|he would pass by,]] [[H5493|he would stop]] [[H8033|there]] [[H398|to eat.]] ^0408

[[H559|Then said]] ⟨the woman⟩ [[H413|to]] [[H376|her husband,]] [[H2009|“Behold,]] [[H4994|now]] [[H3045|I know]] [[H3588|that]] [[H1931|the one]] [[H8548|who often]] [[H5674|comes our way]] [[H6918|is a holy]] [[H376|man]] [[H430|of God.]] ^0409

[[H4994|Please]] [[H6213|let us make]] [[H6996|a small]] [[H5944|room upstairs]] [[H7760|and put]] [[H8033|in it]] [[H4296|a bed,]] [[H7979|a table,]] [[H3678|a chair,]] [[H4501|and a lamp]] [[H935|for him.  Then when he comes]] [[H413|to us,]] [[H5493|he can stay]] [[H8033|there.”]] ^0410

[[H3117|One day]] ⟨Elisha⟩ [[H935|came to visit]] [[H5493|and went]] [[H413|to]] [[H5944|his upper room]] [[H7901|to lie down.]] ^0411

[[H559|And he said]] [[H413|to]] [[H1522|Gehazi]] [[H5288|his servant,]] [[H7121|“Call]] [[H2063|the]] [[H7767|Shunammite woman.”]] [[H7121|And when he had called]] [[H5975|her,  she stood]] [[H6440|before him,]] ^0412

[[H559|and said]] ⟨Elisha⟩ [[H4994|to Gehazi,  “Now]] [[H559|tell]] [[H413|her,]] [[H2009|‘Look,]] [[H3605|you have gone to all]] [[H2063|this]] [[H2729|trouble]] [[H413|for us.]] [[H4100|What]] [[H6213|can we do for you?]] [[H1696|Can we speak]] [[H413|on your behalf to]] [[H4428|the king]] [[H176|or]] [[H8269|the commander]] [[H6635|of the army?’”]] [[H595|“I]] [[H3427|have a home]] [[H8432|among]] [[H5971|my own people,”]] [[H559|she replied.]] ^0413

[[H559|So he asked,]] [[H4100|“Then what]] [[H6213|should be done]] [[H61|for her?”  “Well,]] [[H369|she has  no]] [[H1121|son,”]] [[H1522|Gehazi]] [[H559|replied,]] [[H376|“and her husband]] [[H2204|is old.”]] ^0414

[[H7121|“Call]] [[H559|her,”  said Elisha.]] [[H7121|So Gehazi called]] [[H5975|her,  and she stood]] [[H6607|in the doorway.]] ^0415

[[H559|And Elisha declared,]] [[H2088|“At this]] [[H4150|time]] [[H6256|next year,]] [[H859|you]] [[H2263|will hold]] [[H1121|a son.”]] ⟨in your arms⟩ [[H408|“No,]] [[H113|my lord,”]] [[H559|she said.]] [[H408|“Do not]] [[H3576|lie]] [[H8198|to your maidservant,]] [[H376|O man]] [[H430|of God.”]] ^0416

[[H802|But the woman]] [[H2029|did conceive,]] [[H2088|and at that]] [[H4150|time]] [[H6256|the next year]] [[H3205|she gave birth to]] [[H1121|a son,]] [[H834|just as]] [[H477|Elisha]] [[H1696|had told]] [[H413|her.]] ^0417

[[H1961|And]] [[H3206|the child]] [[H1431|grew,]] [[H3117|and one day]] [[H3318|he went out]] [[H413|to]] [[H1|his father,]] [[H413|who was with]] [[H7114|the harvesters.]] ^0418

[[H7218|“My head!]] [[H7218|My head!”]] [[H559|he complained]] [[H413|to]] [[H1|his father.]] [[H559|So his father told]] [[H5288|a servant,]] [[H5375|“Carry him]] [[H413|to]] [[H517|his mother.”]] ^0419

[[H5375|After had picked him up]] ⟨the servant⟩ [[H935|and carried him]] [[H413|to]] [[H517|his mother,]] ⟨the boy⟩ [[H3427|sat]] [[H5921|on]] [[H1290|her lap]] [[H5704|until]] [[H6672|noon,]] [[H4191|and then he died.]] ^0420

[[H5927|And she went up]] [[H7901|and laid]] [[H5921|him on]] [[H4296|the bed]] [[H376|of the man]] [[H430|of God.]] [[H5462|Then she shut]] ⟨the door⟩ [[H3318|and went out.]] ^0421

[[H7121|And the woman called]] [[H376|her husband]] [[H559|and said,]] [[H4994|“Please]] [[H7971|send]] [[H259|me  one]] [[H4480|of]] [[H5288|the servants]] [[H259|and one]] [[H860|of the donkeys,]] [[H7323|that I may go quickly]] [[H5704|to]] [[H376|the man]] [[H430|of God]] [[H7725|and return.”]] ^0422

[[H4069|“Why]] [[H859|would you]] [[H1980|go]] [[H413|to him]] [[H3117|today?”]] [[H559|he replied.]] [[H3808|“It is not]] [[H2320|a New Moon]] [[H7676|or a Sabbath.”]] [[H7965|“Everything is all right,”]] [[H559|she said.]] ^0423

[[H2280|Then she saddled]] [[H860|the donkey]] [[H559|and told]] [[H5288|her servant,]] [[H5090|“Drive]] [[H1980|onward;]] [[H408|do not]] [[H6113|slow]] [[H7392|the pace]] [[H518|for me  unless]] [[H559|I tell]] ^0424

[[H1980|So she set out]] [[H935|and went]] [[H413|to]] [[H376|the man]] [[H430|of God]] [[H413|at]] [[H2022|Mount]] [[H3760|Carmel.]] [[H376|When the man]] [[H430|of God]] [[H7200|saw]] [[H853|her]] [[H5048|at a distance,]] [[H559|he said]] [[H413|to]] [[H5288|his servant]] [[H1522|Gehazi,]] [[H2009|“Look,]] [[H1975|there is]] [[H7767|the Shunammite woman.]] ^0425

[[H4994|Please]] [[H7323|run out]] [[H6258|now]] [[H7125|to meet her]] [[H559|and ask,]] [[H7965|‘Are you all right?]] [[H376|Is your husband]] [[H7965|all right?]] [[H3206|Is your child]] [[H7965|all right?’”]] [[H559|And she answered,]] [[H7965|“Everything is all right.”]] ^0426

[[H935|When she reached]] [[H376|the man]] [[H430|of God]] [[H413|at]] [[H2022|the mountain,]] [[H2388|she clung]] [[H7272|to his feet.]] [[H1522|Gehazi]] [[H5066|came over]] [[H1920|to push her away,]] [[H376|but the man]] [[H430|of God]] [[H559|said,]] [[H7503|“Leave her alone,]] [[H3588|for]] [[H5315|her soul]] ⟨is⟩ [[H3069|in deep distress,  and the LORD]] [[H5956|has hidden]] [[H4480|it from me]] [[H3808|and has not]] [[H5046|told]] ^0427

[[H559|Then she said,]] [[H113|“Did I ask my lord]] [[H7592|for]] [[H1121|a son?]] [[H3808|Didn’t]] [[H559|I say,]] [[H3808|‘Do not]] [[H7952|deceive me?’”]] ^0428

[[H559|So Elisha said]] [[H1522|to Gehazi,]] [[H2296|“Tie up]] [[H4975|your garment,]] [[H3947|take]] [[H4938|my staff]] [[H3027|in your hand,]] [[H1980|and go!]] [[H3588|If]] [[H4672|you meet]] [[H376|anyone,]] [[H3808|do not]] [[H1288|greet him,]] [[H3588|and if]] [[H376|anyone]] [[H1288|greets you,]] [[H3808|do not]] [[H6030|answer him.]] [[H7760|Then lay]] [[H4938|my staff]] [[H5921|on]] [[H5288|the boys]] [[H6440|face.]] ^0429

[[H517|And the mother]] [[H5288|of the boy]] [[H559|said,]] [[H3068|“As surely as the LORD]] [[H2416|lives]] [[H5315|and as you yourself]] [[H2416|live,]] [[H518|I will not]] [[H5800|leave you.”]] [[H6965|So he got up]] [[H1980|and followed]] [[H310|her.]] ^0430

[[H1522|Gehazi]] [[H5674|went on]] [[H6440|ahead of them]] [[H7760|and laid]] [[H4938|the staff]] [[H5921|on]] [[H5288|the boy’s]] [[H6440|face,]] [[H369|but there was no]] [[H6963|sound]] ⟨or⟩ [[H369|]] [[H7182|response.]] [[H7725|So he went back]] [[H7125|to meet]] ⟨Elisha⟩ [[H5046|and told him,]] [[H5288|“The boy]] [[H3808|has not]] [[H6974|awakened.”]] ^0431

[[H477|When Elisha]] [[H935|reached]] [[H1004|the house,]] [[H2009|there was]] [[H5288|the boy]] [[H7901|lying]] [[H4191|dead]] [[H5921|on]] [[H4296|his bed.]] ^0432

[[H935|So he went in,]] [[H5462|closed]] [[H1817|the door]] [[H1157|behind]] [[H8147|the two of them,]] [[H6419|and prayed]] [[H413|to]] [[H3068|the LORD.]] ^0433

[[H5927|Then got on the bed]] ⟨Elisha⟩ [[H7901|and lay]] [[H5921|on]] [[H3206|the boy,]] [[H6310|mouth]] [[H5921|to]] [[H6310|mouth,]] [[H5869|eye]] [[H5921|to]] [[H5869|eye,]] [[H3709|and hands]] [[H5921|to]] [[H3709|hands.]] [[H1457|As he stretched himself out]] [[H5921|over him,]] [[H3206|the boy’s]] [[H1320|body]] [[H2552|became warm.]] ^0434

[[H7725|Elisha turned away]] [[H1980|and paced]] [[H259|back and forth]] [[H1004|across the room.]] [[H5927|Then he got on the bed]] [[H1457|and stretched himself out]] [[H5921|over again,]] ⟨the boy⟩ [[H5288|and the boy]] [[H2237|sneezed]] [[H7651|seven]] [[H6471|times]] [[H6491|and opened]] [[H5869|his eyes.]] ^0435

[[H7121|Elisha summoned]] [[H1522|Gehazi]] [[H559|and said,]] [[H7121|“Call]] [[H2063|the]] [[H7767|Shunammite woman.”]] [[H7121|So he called]] [[H935|her and she came.]] [[H559|Then Elisha said,]] [[H5375|“Pick up]] [[H1121|your son.”]] ^0436

[[H935|She came in,]] [[H5307|fell]] [[H5921|at]] [[H7272|his feet,]] [[H7812|and bowed]] [[H776|to the ground.]] [[H5375|Then she picked up]] [[H1121|her son]] [[H3318|and went out.]] ^0437

[[H477|When Elisha]] [[H7725|returned]] [[H1537|to Gilgal,]] [[H7458|there was a famine]] [[H776|in the land.]] [[H1121|As the sons]] [[H5030|of the prophets]] [[H3427|were sitting]] [[H6440|at his feet,]] [[H559|he said]] [[H5288|to his attendant,]] [[H8239|“Put on]] [[H1419|the large]] [[H5518|pot]] [[H1310|and boil]] [[H5138|some stew]] [[H1121|for the sons]] [[H5030|of the prophets.”]] ^0438

[[H259|One]] ⟨of them⟩ [[H3318|went out]] [[H413|to]] [[H7704|the field]] [[H3950|to gather]] [[H219|herbs,]] [[H4672|and he found]] [[H7704|a wild]] [[H1612|vine]] [[H4480|from]] [[H3950|which he gathered]] [[H7704|as many wild]] [[H6498|gourds]] [[H899|as his garment [could hold.]] [[H935|Then he came back]] [[H6398|and cut them up]] [[H413|into]] [[H5518|the pot]] [[H5138|of stew,]] [[H3588|though]] [[H3808|no one]] [[H3045|knew]] ⟨what they were⟩. ^0439

[[H3332|And they poured it out]] [[H376|for the men]] [[H398|to eat,]] [[H398|but when they tasted]] [[H5138|the stew]] [[H1992|they]] [[H6817|cried out,]] [[H4194|“There is death]] [[H5518|in the pot,]] [[H376|O man]] [[H430|of God!”]] [[H3808|And they could not]] [[H398|eat]] ⟨it⟩. ^0440

[[H559|Then Elisha said,]] [[H3947|“Get]] [[H7058|some flour.”]] [[H7993|He threw]] [[H413|it into]] [[H5518|the pot]] [[H559|and said,]] [[H3332|“Pour it out]] [[H5971|for the people]] [[H398|to eat.”]] [[H1961|And there was]] [[H3808|nothing]] [[H7451|harmful]] [[H5518|in the pot.]] ^0441

[[H376|Now a man]] [[H1190|from  Baal-shalishah]] [[H935|came]] [[H376|to the man]] [[H430|of God]] [[H6861|with a sack]] [[H6242|of twenty]] [[H3899|loaves]] [[H8184|of barley]] [[H3899|bread]] [[H1061|from the first]] [[H3759|ripe grain.]] [[H5414|“Give]] [[H5971|it to the people]] [[H398|to eat,”]] [[H559|said Elisha.]] ^0442

[[H8334|But his servant]] [[H559|asked,]] [[H4100|“How]] [[H5414|am I to set]] [[H2088|twenty loaves]] [[H6440|before]] [[H3967|a hundred]] [[H376|men?”]] [[H5414|“Give]] [[H5971|it to the people]] [[H398|to eat,”]] [[H559|said Elisha,]] [[H3588|“for]] [[H3541|this is what]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H559|says:]] [[H398|‘They will eat]] [[H3498|and have left over.’”]] ⟨some⟩ ^0443

[[H5414|So he set]] ⟨it⟩ [[H6440|before them,]] [[H398|and they ate]] [[H3498|and had left over,]] ⟨some⟩ [[H1697|according to the word]] [[H3068|of the LORD.]] ^0444

[[H5283|Now Naaman,]] [[H8269|the commander]] [[H6635|of the army]] [[H4428|of the king]] [[H758|of Aram,]] [[H1961|was]] [[H1419|a great]] [[H376|man]] [[H113|in his master’s]] [[H6440|sight]] [[H5375|and highly regarded;]] [[H3588|for]] [[H3068|through him  the LORD]] [[H5414|had given]] [[H8668|victory]] [[H758|to Aram.]] [[H1961|And he was]] [[H1368|a mighty warrior,]] ⟨but he was⟩ [[H6879|a leper.]] ^0501

[[H758|At this time the Arameans]] [[H3318|had gone]] [[H1416|out in bands]] [[H7617|and had taken]] [[H6996|a young]] [[H5291|girl]] [[H776|from the land]] [[H3478|of Israel,]] [[H1961|and she was serving]] [[H5283|Naaman’s]] [[H802|wife.]] ^0502

[[H559|She said]] [[H413|to]] [[H1404|her mistress,]] [[H305|“If only]] [[H113|my master]] [[H5030|would go to the prophet]] [[H834|who]] [[H8111|is in Samaria,]] [[H622|he would cure]] [[H853|him]] [[H6883|of his leprosy.”]] ^0503

[[H935|And Naaman went]] [[H5046|and told]] [[H113|his master]] [[H2063|what]] [[H5291|the girl]] [[H776|from the land]] [[H3478|of Israel]] [[H1696|had said.]] ^0504

[[H1980|“Go now,”]] [[H559|said]] [[H4428|the king]] [[H758|of Aram,]] [[H7971|“and I will send you with]] [[H5612|a letter]] [[H413|to]] [[H4428|the king]] [[H3478|of Israel.”]] [[H1980|So departed,]] ⟨Naaman⟩ [[H3947|taking]] [[H3027|with him]] [[H6235|ten]] [[H3603|talents]] [[H3701|of silver,]] [[H8337|six]] [[H505|thousand]] ⟨shekels⟩ [[H2091|of gold,]] [[H6235|and ten]] [[H2487|sets]] [[H899|of clothing.]] ^0505

[[H5612|And the letter]] [[H935|that he took]] [[H413|to]] [[H4428|the king]] [[H3478|of Israel]] [[H559|stated:]] [[H6258|“With]] [[H2088|this]] [[H5612|letter]] [[H7971|I have sent]] [[H5650|my servant]] [[H5283|Naaman,]] [[H622|so that you may cure him]] [[H6883|of his leprosy.”]] ^0506

[[H4428|When the king]] [[H3478|of Israel]] [[H7121|read]] [[H5612|the letter,]] [[H7167|he tore]] [[H899|his clothes]] [[H559|and asked,]] [[H589|“Am I]] [[H430|God,]] [[H4191|killing]] [[H2421|and giving life,]] [[H3588|that]] [[H2088|this]] ⟨man⟩ [[H7971|expects]] [[H413|me]] [[H622|to cure]] [[H6883|a leper?]] [[H3045|Surely you can]] [[H7200|see]] [[H3588|that]] [[H1931|he]] [[H579|is seeking a quarrel]] ^0507

[[H1961|Now]] [[H477|when Elisha]] [[H376|the man]] [[H430|of God]] [[H8085|heard]] [[H3588|that]] [[H4428|the king]] [[H3478|of Israel]] [[H7167|had torn]] [[H899|his clothes,]] [[H7971|he sent]] [[H413|a message to]] [[H4428|the king:]] [[H4100|“Why]] [[H7167|have you torn]] [[H899|your clothes?]] [[H4994|Please]] [[H935|let come]] ⟨the man⟩ [[H413|to me,]] [[H3045|and he will know]] [[H3588|that]] [[H3426|there is]] [[H5030|a prophet]] [[H3478|in Israel.]] ^0508

[[H5283|So Naaman]] [[H935|came]] [[H5483|with his horses]] [[H7393|and chariots]] [[H5975|and stood]] [[H6607|at the door]] [[H477|of Elisha’s]] [[H1004|house.]] ^0509

[[H477|Then Elisha]] [[H7971|sent]] [[H413|him]] [[H4397|a messenger,]] [[H559|who said,]] [[H1980|“Go]] [[H7364|and wash yourself]] [[H7651|seven]] [[H6471|times]] [[H3383|in the Jordan,]] [[H1320|and your flesh]] [[H7725|will be restored,]] [[H2891|and you will be clean.”]] ^0510

[[H5283|But Naaman]] [[H1980|went away]] [[H7107|angry,]] [[H559|saying,]] [[H559|“I thought that]] [[H3318|he would surely come out,]] [[H5975|stand]] [[H7121|and call]] [[H8034|on the name]] [[H3068|of the LORD]] [[H430|his God,]] [[H5130|and wave]] [[H3027|his hand]] [[H413|over]] [[H4725|the spot]] [[H622|to cure]] [[H6879|my leprosy.]] ^0511

⟨Are⟩ [[H3808|not]] [[H71|Abanah]] [[H6554|and Pharpar,]] [[H5104|the rivers]] [[H1834|of Damascus,]] [[H2896|better]] [[H3605|than all]] [[H4325|the waters]] [[H3478|of Israel?]] [[H3808|Could I not]] [[H7364|have washed]] [[H2891|in them  and been cleansed?”]] [[H6437|So he turned]] [[H1980|and went away]] [[H2534|in a rage.]] ^0512

[[H5650|Naaman's servants, however,]] [[H5066|approached him]] [[H1696|and said,]] [[H1|“My father,]] [[H5030|if the prophet]] [[H1696|had told]] [[H413|you]] [[H1419|to do some great]] [[H1697|thing,]] [[H3808|would you not]] [[H6213|have done]] ⟨it⟩?

[[H3381|So Naaman went down]] [[H2881|and dipped himself]] [[H3383|in the Jordan]] [[H7651|seven]] [[H6471|times,]] [[H1697|according to the word]] [[H376|of the man]] [[H430|of God,]] [[H1320|and his flesh]] [[H7725|was restored]] [[H1320|and became like]] ⟨that⟩ [[H6996|of a little]] [[H5288|child,]] [[H2891|and he was clean.]] ^0514

[[H1931|Then Naaman]] [[H3605|and all]] [[H4264|his attendants]] [[H7725|went back]] [[H413|to]] [[H376|the man]] [[H430|of God,]] [[H5975|stood]] [[H6440|before him,]] [[H559|and declared,]] [[H4994|“Now]] [[H3045|I know]] [[H2009|for sure]] [[H369|that there is no]] [[H430|God]] [[H3605|in all]] [[H776|the earth]] [[H3588|except]] [[H3478|in Israel.]] [[H6258|So]] [[H4994|please]] [[H3947|accept]] [[H1293|a gift]] [[H853|from]] [[H5650|your servant.]] ^0515

[[H559|But Elisha replied,]] [[H3068|“As surely as the LORD]] [[H2416|lives,]] [[H6440|before whom]] [[H5975|I stand,]] [[H518|I will not]] [[H3947|accept it.”]] [[H6484|And although Naaman urged]] [[H3947|him  to accept it,]] [[H3985|he refused.]] ^0516

[[H3808|“If you will not,”]] [[H559|said]] [[H5283|Naaman,]] [[H4994|“please]] [[H5650|let me, your servant,]] [[H5414|be given]] [[H127|as much soil]] [[H6776|as a pair]] [[H6505|of mules]] [[H4853|can carry.]] [[H3588|For]] [[H5650|your servant]] [[H3808|will never]] [[H5750|again]] [[H6213|make]] [[H5930|a burnt offering]] [[H2077|or a sacrifice]] [[H312|to any other]] [[H430|god]] [[H3588|but]] [[H3068|the LORD.]] ^0517

[[H3068|Yet may the LORD]] [[H5545|forgive]] [[H5650|your servant]] [[H2088|this]] [[H1697|one thing:]] [[H113|When my master]] [[H935|goes into]] [[H1004|the temple]] [[H7417|of Rimmon]] [[H7812|to worship]] [[H8033|there,]] [[H1931|and he]] [[H8172|leans]] [[H5921|on]] [[H3027|my arm,]] [[H7812|and I bow down]] [[H1004|in the temple]] [[H7417|of Rimmon,]] [[H3068|may the LORD]] [[H5545|forgive]] [[H5650|your servant]] [[H2088|in this]] [[H1697|matter.]] ^0518

[[H1980|“Go]] [[H7965|in peace,”]] [[H559|said]] ⟨Elisha⟩, [[H1980|and departed.]] ⟨Naaman⟩ [[H776|But after he had traveled a short distance,]] ^0519

[[H1522|Gehazi,]] [[H5288|the servant]] [[H477|of Elisha]] [[H376|the man]] [[H430|of God,]] [[H559|said,]] [[H2009|“Look,]] [[H113|my master]] [[H2820|has spared]] [[H2088|this]] [[H761|Aramean,]] [[H5283|Naaman,]] [[H3947|while not accepting]] [[H834|what]] [[H935|he brought.]] [[H3068|As surely as the LORD]] [[H2416|lives,]] [[H7323|I will run]] [[H310|after him]] [[H3947|and get]] [[H3972|something]] [[H853|from him.]] ^0520

[[H1522|So Gehazi]] [[H7291|pursued]] [[H5283|Naaman.]] [[H5283|And when Naaman]] [[H7200|saw]] ⟨him⟩ [[H7323|running]] [[H310|toward him,]] [[H5307|he got down]] [[H5921|from]] [[H4818|the chariot]] [[H7125|to meet him]] [[H559|and asked,]] [[H7965|“Is everything all right?”]] ^0521

[[H7965|“Everything all right,”]] ⟨is⟩ [[H559|Gehazi replied.]] [[H113|“My master]] [[H7971|has sent]] [[H559|me to say,]] [[H6258|‘I have just now]] [[H2009|discovered]] [[H8147|that two]] [[H5288|young men]] [[H1121|from the sons]] [[H5030|of the prophets]] [[H935|have come]] [[H413|to me]] [[H2022|from the hill country]] [[H669|of Ephraim.]] [[H4994|Please]] [[H5414|give]] [[H3603|them  a talent]] [[H3701|of silver]] [[H8147|and two]] [[H2487|sets]] [[H899|of clothing.”]] ^0522

[[H5283|But Naaman]] [[H559|insisted,]] [[H2974|“Please,]] [[H3947|take]] [[H3603|two talents.”]] [[H6555|And he urged]] [[H6887|Gehazi.  Then he tied up]] ⟨to accept them⟩ [[H3603|two talents]] [[H3701|of silver]] [[H8147|in two]] [[H2754|bags]] [[H8147|along with two]] [[H2487|sets]] [[H899|of clothing]] [[H5414|and gave]] [[H413|them to]] [[H8147|two]] [[H5288|of his servants,]] [[H5375|who carried them]] [[H6440|ahead of Gehazi.]] ^0523

[[H935|When Gehazi came]] [[H413|to]] [[H6076|the hill,]] [[H3947|he took]] [[H3027|the gifts from]] ⟨the servants⟩ [[H6485|and stored them]] [[H1004|in the house.]] [[H7971|Then he dismissed]] [[H582|the men,]] [[H1980|and they departed.]] ^0524

[[H1931|When Gehazi]] [[H935|went in]] [[H5975|and stood]] [[H413|before]] [[H113|his master,]] [[H477|Elisha]] [[H559|asked]] [[H413|him,]] [[H1522|“Gehazi,]] [[H575|where?”]] ⟨have you been⟩ [[H5650|“Your servant]] [[H3808|did not]] [[H1980|go]] [[H575|anywhere,”]] [[H559|he replied.]] ^0525

[[H559|But Elisha questioned him,]] [[H3808|“Did not]] [[H3820|my spirit]] [[H1980|go]] ⟨with you⟩ [[H834|when]] [[H376|the man]] [[H2015|got down]] [[H5921|from]] [[H4818|his chariot]] [[H7125|to meet you?]] [[H6256|Is this the time]] [[H3947|to accept]] [[H3701|money]] [[H899|and clothing,]] [[H2132|olive groves]] [[H3754|and vineyards,]] [[H6629|sheep]] [[H1241|and oxen,]] [[H5650|menservants]] [[H8198|and maidservants?]] ^0526

[[H6883|Therefore, the leprosy]] [[H5283|of Naaman]] [[H1692|will cling]] [[H2233|to you  and your descendants]] [[H5769|forever!”]] [[H3318|And as Gehazi left]] [[H6440|his presence,]] ⟨he was⟩ [[H6879|leprous—]] ⟨as white⟩ [[H7950|as snow.]] ^0527

[[H1121|Now the sons]] [[H5030|of the prophets]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H477|Elisha,]] [[H4994|“Please]] [[H2009|take note]] [[H4725|that the place]] [[H834|where]] [[H587|we]] [[H3427|meet]] [[H6440|with you]] [[H6862|is too small]] [[H4480|for us.]] ^0601

[[H4994|Please]] [[H1980|let us go]] [[H5704|to]] [[H3383|the Jordan,]] [[H8033|where]] [[H376|each of us]] [[H3947|can get]] [[H259|a]] [[H6982|log]] [[H6213|so we can build]] [[H4725|ourselves a place]] [[H3427|to live]] [[H8033|there.”]] [[H1980|“Go,”]] [[H559|said]] ⟨Elisha⟩. ^0602

[[H259|Then one of them]] [[H559|said,]] [[H4994|“Please]] [[H1980|come]] [[H854|with]] [[H5650|your servants.”]] [[H589|“I will]] [[H1980|come,”]] [[H559|he replied.]] ^0603

[[H1980|So went]] ⟨Elisha⟩ [[H854|with them,]] [[H935|and when they came]] [[H3383|to the Jordan,]] [[H1504|they began to cut down]] [[H6086|some trees.]] ^0604

[[H259|As one]] [[H5307|of them was cutting down]] [[H6982|a tree,]] [[H1270|the iron]] ⟨axhead⟩ [[H5307|fell]] [[H413|into]] [[H4325|the water.]] [[H162|“Oh,]] [[H113|my master,”]] [[H6817|he cried out,]] [[H1931|“it]] [[H7592|was borrowed!”]] ^0605

[[H575|“Where]] [[H5307|did it fall?”]] [[H559|asked]] [[H376|the man]] [[H430|of God.]] [[H7200|And when he showed]] [[H4725|him the place,]] [[H7094|the man of God cut]] [[H6086|a stick,]] [[H7993|threw]] [[H8033|it there,]] [[H1270|and made the iron]] [[H6687|float.]] ^0606

[[H7311|“Lift out,”]] ⟨it⟩ [[H559|he said,]] [[H7971|and reached out]] ⟨the man⟩ [[H3027|his hand]] [[H3947|and took it.]] ^0607

[[H4428|Now the king]] [[H758|of Aram]] [[H1961|was]] [[H3898|at war]] [[H3478|against Israel.]] [[H3289|After consulting]] [[H413|with]] [[H5650|his servants,]] [[H559|he said,]] [[H8466|“My camp]] ⟨will be⟩ [[H413|in]] [[H6423|such]] [[H492|and such]] [[H4725|a place.”]] ^0608

[[H376|Then the man]] [[H430|of God]] [[H7971|sent]] [[H413|word to]] [[H4428|the king]] [[H3478|of Israel:]] [[H8104|“Be careful]] [[H5674|passing by]] [[H2088|this]] [[H4725|place,]] [[H3588|for]] [[H758|the Arameans]] [[H5181|are going down]] [[H8033|there.”]] ^0609

[[H4428|So the king]] [[H3478|of Israel]] [[H7971|sent]] [[H413|word to]] [[H4725|the place]] [[H376|the man]] [[H430|of God]] [[H559|had pointed out.]] [[H259|Time and again]] ⟨Elisha⟩ [[H2094|warned the king,]] [[H8104|so that he was on his guard]] [[H8033|in such places.]] ^0610

[[H5921|For]] [[H2088|this]] [[H1697|reason,]] [[H4428|the king]] [[H758|of Aram]] [[H5590|became enraged]] [[H7121|and called]] [[H5650|his servants]] [[H559|to demand]] [[H413|of them,]] [[H5046|“Tell me,]] [[H4310|which one]] [[H7945|of us]] ⟨is⟩ [[H413|on the side]] [[H4428|of the king]] [[H3478|of Israel?”]] ^0611

[[H259|But one]] [[H5650|of his servants]] [[H559|replied,]] [[H3808|“No one,]] [[H113|my lord]] [[H4428|the king.]] [[H3588|For]] [[H477|Elisha,]] [[H5030|the prophet]] [[H3478|in Israel,]] [[H5046|tells]] [[H4428|the king]] [[H3478|of Israel]] [[H1697|the very words]] [[H1696|you speak]] [[H2315|in your bedroom.”]] ^0612

[[H559|So the king said,]] [[H1980|“Go]] [[H7200|and see]] [[H351|where]] [[H1931|he]] ⟨is⟩, [[H7971|that I may send]] [[H3947|men to capture him.”]] [[H5046|On receiving the report,]] [[H1886|“Elisha is in Dothan,”]] ^0613

⟨the king of Aram⟩ [[H7971|sent]] [[H5483|horses,]] [[H7393|chariots,]] [[H3515|and a great]] [[H2428|army.]] [[H935|They went there]] [[H3915|by night]] [[H5362|and surrounded]] [[H5892|the city.]] ^0614

[[H8334|When the servant]] [[H376|of the man]] [[H430|of God]] [[H6965|got up]] [[H3318|and went out]] [[H7925|early in the morning,]] [[H2428|an army]] [[H5483|with horses]] [[H7393|and chariots]] [[H5437|had surrounded]] [[H5892|the city.]] [[H5288|So he]] [[H559|asked Elisha,]] [[H162|“Oh,]] [[H113|my master,]] [[H349|what]] [[H6213|are we to do?”]] ^0615

[[H408|“Do not]] [[H3372|be afraid,”]] [[H559|Elisha answered,]] [[H3588|“for]] [[H834|those who]] ⟨are⟩ [[H854|with us]] ⟨are⟩ [[H7227|more]] [[H834|than those who]] ⟨are⟩ [[H854|with them.”]] ^0616

[[H477|Then Elisha]] [[H6419|prayed,]] [[H3068|“O LORD,]] [[H4994|please]] [[H6491|open]] [[H5869|his eyes]] [[H7200|that he may see.”]] [[H3068|And the LORD]] [[H6491|opened]] [[H5869|the eyes]] [[H5288|of the young man,]] [[H7200|and he saw that]] [[H2022|the hills]] [[H4390|were full of]] [[H5483|horses]] [[H7393|and chariots]] [[H784|of fire]] [[H5439|all around]] [[H477|Elisha.]] ^0617

[[H3381|As the Arameans came down]] [[H413|against him,]] [[H477|Elisha]] [[H6419|prayed]] [[H413|to]] [[H3068|the LORD,]] [[H4994|“Please]] [[H5221|strike]] [[H2088|these]] [[H1471|people]] [[H5575|with blindness.”]] [[H5221|So He struck]] [[H5575|them with blindness,]] [[H1697|according to the word]] [[H477|of Elisha.]] ^0618

[[H477|And Elisha]] [[H559|told]] [[H413|them,]] [[H2088|“This]] [[H3808|is not]] [[H1870|the way,]] [[H2090|and this]] [[H3808|is not]] [[H5892|the city.]] [[H1980|Follow]] [[H310|me,]] [[H1980|and I will take]] [[H413|you to]] [[H376|the man]] [[H1245|you are seeking.”]] [[H1980|And he led]] [[H8111|them to Samaria.]] ^0619

[[H935|When they had entered]] [[H8111|Samaria,]] [[H477|Elisha]] [[H559|said,]] [[H3068|“O LORD,]] [[H6491|open]] [[H5869|the eyes]] [[H428|of these]] ⟨men⟩ [[H7200|that they may see.”]] [[H3068|Then the LORD]] [[H6491|opened]] [[H5869|their eyes,]] [[H7200|and they looked around]] [[H2009|and discovered]] [[H8432|they were in]] [[H8111|Samaria.]] ^0620

[[H4428|And when the king]] [[H3478|of Israel]] [[H7200|saw]] [[H853|them,]] [[H559|he asked]] [[H477|Elisha,]] [[H1|“My father,]] [[H5221|shall I kill]] ⟨them⟩? [[H5221|Shall I kill?”]] ⟨them⟩ ^0621

[[H3808|“Do not]] [[H5221|kill them,”]] [[H559|he replied.]] [[H859|“Would you]] [[H5221|kill]] [[H834|those]] [[H7617|you have captured]] [[H2719|with your own sword]] [[H7198|or bow?]] [[H7760|Set]] [[H3899|food]] [[H4325|and water]] [[H6440|before them,]] [[H398|that they may eat]] [[H8354|and drink]] [[H1980|and then return]] [[H413|to]] [[H113|their master.”]] ^0622

[[H1419|So prepared a great]] ⟨the king⟩ [[H3739|feast]] [[H3740|for them,]] [[H398|and after they had finished eating]] [[H8354|and drinking,]] [[H7971|he sent them away,]] [[H1980|and they returned]] [[H413|to]] [[H113|their master.]] [[H758|And the Aramean]] [[H1416|raiders]] [[H3808|did not]] [[H935|come]] [[H776|into the land]] [[H3478|of Israel]] [[H3254|again.]] ^0623

[[H310|Some time later,]] [[H1130|Ben-hadad]] [[H4428|king]] [[H758|of Aram]] [[H6908|assembled]] [[H3605|his entire]] [[H4264|army]] [[H5927|and marched up]] [[H6696|to besiege]] [[H8111|Samaria.]] ^0624

[[H1961|So there was]] [[H1419|a great]] [[H7458|famine]] [[H8111|in Samaria.]] [[H2009|Indeed,]] [[H6696|they besieged]] ⟨the city⟩ [[H5921|]] [[H5704|so long that]] [[H2543|a donkey’s]] [[H7218|head]] [[H1961|sold]] [[H8084|for eighty]] ⟨shekels⟩ [[H3701|of silver,]] [[H7255|and a quarter]] [[H6894|cab]] [[H2755|of dove’s dung]] [[H2568|sold for five]] ⟨shekels⟩ [[H3701|of silver.]] ^0625

[[H4428|As the king]] [[H3478|of Israel]] [[H5674|was passing by]] [[H5921|on]] [[H2346|the wall,]] [[H802|a woman]] [[H6817|cried out]] [[H413|to him,]] [[H3467|“Help me,]] [[H113|my lord]] [[H4428|the king!”]] ^0626

[[H559|He answered,]] [[H3068|“If the LORD]] [[H408|does not]] [[H3467|help you,]] [[H370|where]] [[H3467|can I find help for you?]] [[H4480|From]] [[H1637|the threshing floor]] [[H176|or]] [[H3342|the winepress?”]] ^0627

[[H4428|Then the king]] [[H559|asked her,]] [[H4100|“What is the matter?”]] [[H559|And she answered,]] [[H2063|“This]] [[H802|woman]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to me,]] [[H5414|‘Give up]] [[H1121|your son,]] [[H398|and we will eat him today,]] [[H853|and]] [[H4279|tomorrow]] [[H398|we will eat]] [[H1121|my son.’]] ^0628

[[H1310|So we boiled]] [[H1121|my son]] [[H398|and ate him,]] [[H312|and the next]] [[H3117|day]] [[H559|I said]] [[H413|to her,]] [[H5414|‘Give up]] [[H1121|your son,]] [[H398|and we will eat him.’]] [[H2244|But she has hidden]] [[H1121|her son.”]] ^0629

[[H4428|When the king]] [[H8085|heard]] [[H1697|the words]] [[H802|of the woman,]] [[H7167|he tore]] [[H899|his clothes.]] [[H1931|And as he]] [[H5674|passed by]] [[H5921|on]] [[H2346|the wall,]] [[H5971|the people]] [[H7200|saw]] [[H8242|the sackcloth]] [[H1004|under his clothes]] [[H5921|next to]] [[H1320|his skin.]] ^0630

[[H559|He announced,]] [[H430|“May God]] [[H3541|punish]] [[H3541|me,  and ever so]] [[H3254|severely,]] [[H518|if]] [[H7218|the head]] [[H477|of Elisha]] [[H1121|son]] [[H8202|of Shaphat]] [[H5975|remains]] [[H5921|on his shoulders]] [[H3117|through this day!”]] ^0631

[[H477|Now Elisha]] [[H3427|was sitting]] [[H1004|in his house,]] [[H2205|and the elders]] [[H3427|were sitting]] [[H854|with him.]] [[H7971|The king sent]] [[H376|a messenger]] [[H6440|ahead,]] [[H2962|but before]] ⟨he⟩ [[H4397|]] [[H935|arrived,]] [[H1931|Elisha]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H2205|the elders,]] [[H7200|“Do you see]] [[H3588|how]] [[H2088|this]] [[H1121|murderer]] [[H7971|has sent]] [[H5493|someone to cut off]] [[H7218|my head?]] [[H7200|Look,]] [[H4397|when the messenger]] [[H935|comes,]] [[H5462|shut]] [[H1817|the door]] [[H3905|to keep him out.]] [[H3808|Is not]] [[H6963|the sound]] [[H113|of his masters]] [[H7272|footsteps]] [[H310|behind him?]] ^0632

[[H5750|While Elisha was still]] [[H1696|speaking]] [[H5973|with them,]] [[H4397|the messenger]] [[H3381|came down]] [[H413|to him.]] [[H559|And said,]] ⟨the king⟩ [[H2063|“This]] [[H7451|calamity]] ⟨is⟩ [[H853|from]] [[H3068|the LORD.]] [[H4100|Why]] [[H3176|should I wait]] [[H3068|for the LORD]] [[H5750|any longer?”]] ^0633

[[H477|Then Elisha]] [[H559|said,]] [[H8085|“Hear]] [[H1697|the word]] [[H3068|of the LORD!]] [[H3541|This is what]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H559|says:]] [[H6256|‘About this time]] [[H4279|tomorrow]] [[H8179|at the gate]] [[H8111|of Samaria,]] [[H5429|a seah]] [[H5560|of fine flour]] ⟨will sell⟩ [[H8255|for a shekel,]] [[H5429|and two seahs]] [[H8184|of barley]] [[H8255|will sell for a shekel.’”]] ^0701

[[H7991|But the officer]] [[H5921|on]] [[H3027|whose arm]] [[H4428|the king]] [[H8172|leaned]] [[H6030|answered]] [[H376|the man]] [[H430|of God,]] [[H2009|“Look,]] [[H3068|even if the LORD]] [[H6213|were to make]] [[H699|windows]] [[H8064|in heaven,]] [[H2088|could this]] [[H1961|really happen?”]] [[H7200|“You will see]] ⟨it⟩ [[H5869|with your own eyes,”]] [[H559|replied]] ⟨Elisha⟩, [[H398|“but you will not eat]] [[H8033|any of it.”]] ^0702

[[H702|Now there were four]] [[H376|men]] [[H6879|with leprosy]] [[H6607|at the entrance]] [[H8179|to the gate,]] [[H559|and they said]] [[H413|to]] [[H376|one]] [[H7453|another,]] [[H4100|“Why]] [[H3427|just sit]] [[H6311|here]] [[H5704|until]] [[H4191|we die?]] ^0703

[[H518|If]] [[H559|we say,]] [[H935|‘Let us go into]] [[H5892|the city,’]] [[H4191|we will die]] [[H8033|there]] [[H7458|from the famine]] [[H5892|in the city;]] [[H518|but if]] [[H3427|we sit]] [[H6311|here,]] [[H4191|we will also die.]] [[H6258|So come now,]] [[H5307|let us go over]] [[H413|to]] [[H4264|the camp]] [[H758|of the Arameans.]] [[H518|If]] [[H2421|they let us live,]] [[H2421|we will live;]] [[H518|if]] [[H4191|they kill us,]] [[H4191|we will die.]] ^0704

[[H6965|So they arose]] [[H5399|at twilight]] [[H935|and went]] [[H413|to]] [[H4264|the camp]] [[H758|of the Arameans.]] [[H935|But when they came]] [[H5704|to]] [[H7097|the outskirts]] [[H4264|of the camp,]] [[H369|there was not]] [[H376|a man]] [[H2009|to be found.]] ^0705

[[H136|For the LORD]] ⟨had caused⟩ [[H758|the Arameans]] [[H8085|to hear]] [[H6963|the sound]] [[H7393|of chariots,]] [[H5483|horses,]] [[H1419|and a great]] [[H2428|army,]] [[H559|so that they said]] [[H413|to]] [[H376|each]] [[H251|other,]] [[H2009|“Look,]] [[H4428|the king]] [[H3478|of Israel]] [[H7936|must have hired]] [[H4428|the kings]] [[H2850|of the Hittites]] [[H853|and]] [[H4714|Egyptians]] [[H935|to attack]] [[H5921|us.]] ^0706

[[H6965|Thus had arisen]] ⟨the Arameans⟩ [[H5127|and fled]] [[H5399|at twilight,]] [[H5800|abandoning]] [[H168|their tents]] [[H853|and]] [[H5483|horses]] [[H853|and]] [[H2543|donkeys.]] [[H4264|The camp was intact,]] [[H5127|and they had run]] [[H413|for]] [[H5315|their lives.]] ^0707

[[H428|When the]] [[H6879|lepers]] [[H935|reached]] [[H7097|the edge]] [[H4264|of the camp,]] [[H935|they went]] [[H413|into]] [[H259|a]] [[H168|tent]] [[H398|to eat]] [[H8354|and drink.]] [[H5375|Then they carried off]] [[H3701|the silver,]] [[H2091|gold,]] [[H899|and clothing,]] [[H1980|and went]] [[H2934|and hid]] ⟨them⟩. [[H7725|On returning,]] [[H935|they entered]] [[H312|another]] [[H168|tent,]] [[H5375|carried off]] ⟨some items⟩ [[H8033|from there,]] [[H2934|and hid them.]] ^0708

[[H559|Finally, they said]] [[H413|to]] [[H376|one]] [[H7453|another,]] [[H587|“We are]] [[H3808|not]] [[H6213|doing]] [[H3651|what is right.]] [[H3117|Today]] [[H3117|is a day]] [[H1309|of good news.]] [[H587|If we]] [[H2814|are silent]] [[H2442|and wait]] [[H5704|until]] [[H1242|morning]] [[H216|light,]] [[H5771|our sin]] [[H4672|will overtake us.]] [[H6258|Now, therefore,]] [[H935|let us go]] [[H5046|and tell]] [[H4428|the kings]] [[H1004|household.]] ^0709

[[H935|So they went]] [[H7121|and called out]] [[H413|to]] [[H7778|the gatekeepers]] [[H5892|of the city,]] [[H5046|saying,]] [[H935|“We went]] [[H413|to]] [[H758|the Aramean]] [[H4264|camp]] [[H369|and no]] [[H376|one]] ⟨was⟩ [[H8033|there—]] [[H6963|not a trace—]] [[H518|only]] [[H631|tethered]] [[H5483|horses]] [[H2543|and donkeys,]] [[H168|and the tents]] [[H1992|were intact.”]] ^0710

[[H7778|The gatekeepers]] [[H7121|shouted the news,]] [[H5046|and it was reported]] [[H4428|to the king’s]] [[H1004|household.]] ^0711

[[H4428|So the king]] [[H6965|got up]] [[H3915|in the night]] [[H559|and said]] [[H413|to]] [[H5650|his servants,]] [[H5046|“Let me tell]] [[H834|you  what]] [[H758|the Arameans]] [[H6213|have done to us.]] [[H3045|They know]] [[H587|we]] [[H7457|are starving,]] [[H3318|so they have left]] [[H4264|the camp]] [[H2247|to hide]] [[H7704|in the field,]] [[H559|thinking,]] [[H3588|‘When]] [[H3318|they come out]] [[H4480|of]] [[H5892|the city,]] [[H8610|we will take them]] [[H2416|alive]] [[H935|and enter]] [[H5892|the city.]] ^0712

[[H259|But one]] [[H4480|of]] [[H5650|his servants]] [[H6030|replied,]] [[H4994|“Please,]] [[H3947|have take]] ⟨scouts⟩ [[H2568|five]] [[H5483|of the horses]] [[H834|that]] [[H7604|remain]] [[H2009|in the city.  Their plight]] [[H3605|will be no worse than all]] [[H3478|the Israelites]] [[H834|who]] [[H7604|are left]] [[H2005|here.  You can see]] [[H3605|that]] [[H3478|all the Israelites]] [[H834|here]] [[H8552|are doomed.]] [[H7971|So let us send them]] [[H7200|and find out.]] ^0713

[[H3947|Then took]] ⟨the scouts⟩ [[H8147|two]] [[H7393|chariots]] [[H5483|with horses,]] [[H4428|and the king]] [[H7971|sent]] [[H310|them after]] [[H758|the Aramean]] [[H4264|army,]] [[H559|saying,]] [[H1980|“Go]] [[H7200|and see.”]] ^0714

[[H1980|And they tracked]] [[H5704|them as]] [[H3383|far as the Jordan,]] [[H2009|and indeed,]] [[H3605|the whole]] [[H1870|way]] [[H4392|was littered with]] [[H899|the clothing]] [[H3627|and equipment]] [[H758|the Arameans]] [[H7993|had thrown off]] [[H2648|in haste.]] [[H4397|So the scouts]] [[H7725|returned]] [[H5046|and told]] [[H4428|the king.]] ^0715

[[H5971|Then the people]] [[H3318|went out]] [[H962|and plundered]] [[H4264|the camp]] [[H758|of the Arameans.]] [[H1961|It was then that]] [[H5429|a seah]] [[H5560|of fine flour]] ⟨sold⟩ [[H8255|for a shekel,]] [[H5429|and two seahs]] [[H8184|of barley]] ⟨sold⟩ [[H8255|for a shekel,]] [[H1697|according to the word]] [[H3068|of the LORD.]] ^0716

[[H4428|Now the king]] [[H6485|had appointed]] [[H7991|the officer]] [[H5921|on]] [[H3027|whose arm]] [[H8172|he leaned]] [[H5921|to be in charge of]] [[H8179|the gate,]] [[H5971|but the people]] [[H7429|trampled him]] [[H8179|in the gateway,]] [[H4191|and he died,]] [[H834|just as]] [[H376|the man]] [[H430|of God]] [[H1696|had foretold]] [[H4428|when the king]] [[H3381|had come]] [[H413|to him.]] ^0717

[[H1961|It happened]] [[H376|just as the man]] [[H430|of God]] [[H1696|had told]] [[H4428|the king:]] [[H6256|“About this time]] [[H4279|tomorrow]] [[H8179|at the gate]] [[H8111|of Samaria,]] [[H5429|two seahs]] [[H8184|of barley]] [[H8255|will sell for a shekel,]] [[H5429|and a seah]] [[H5560|of fine flour]] [[H1961|will sell]] [[H8255|for a shekel.”]] ^0718

[[H7991|And the officer]] [[H6030|had answered]] [[H376|the man]] [[H430|of God,]] [[H2009|“Look,]] [[H3068|even if the LORD]] [[H6213|were to make]] [[H699|windows]] [[H8064|in heaven,]] [[H2088|could this]] [[H1961|really happen?”]] [[H559|So Elisha had replied,]] [[H7200|“You will see]] ⟨it⟩ [[H5869|with your own eyes,]] [[H3808|but you will not]] [[H398|eat]] [[H8033|any of it.”]] ^0719

[[H3651|And this]] [[H1961|is just what happened]] [[H5971|to him.  The people]] [[H7429|trampled]] [[H8179|him in the gateway,]] [[H4191|and he died.]] ^0720

[[H477|Now Elisha]] [[H1696|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H802|the woman]] [[H1121|whose son]] [[H2421|he had restored to life,]] [[H6965|“Arise,]] [[H859|you]] [[H1004|and your household,]] [[H1980|and go]] [[H1481|and live as a foreigner]] [[H834|wherever]] [[H1481|you can.]] [[H3588|For]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H7121|has decreed]] [[H7651|a seven-year]] [[H7458|famine,]] [[H935|and it has already come]] [[H413|to]] [[H776|the land.]] ^0801

[[H802|So the woman]] [[H6965|got ready]] [[H6213|and did]] [[H376|as the man]] [[H430|of God]] [[H1697|had instructed.]] [[H1931|She]] [[H1004|and her household]] [[H1481|lived as foreigners]] [[H7651|for seven]] [[H8141|years]] [[H776|in the land]] [[H6430|of the Philistines.]] ^0802

[[H7097|At the end]] [[H7651|of seven]] [[H8141|years,]] [[H802|when the woman]] [[H7725|returned]] [[H776|from the land]] [[H6430|of the Philistines,]] [[H3318|she went]] [[H413|to]] [[H4428|the king]] [[H6817|to appeal]] [[H413|for]] [[H1004|her house]] [[H413|and]] [[H7704|her land.]] ^0803

[[H4428|Now the king]] [[H1696|had been speaking]] [[H413|to]] [[H1522|Gehazi,]] [[H5288|the servant]] [[H376|of the man]] [[H430|of God,]] [[H559|saying,]] [[H4994|“Please]] [[H5608|relate]] [[H3605|to me  all]] [[H1419|the great things]] [[H477|Elisha]] [[H6213|has done.”]] ^0804

[[H1961|And as]] [[H1931|Gehazi]] [[H5608|was telling]] [[H4428|the king]] [[H834|how]] [[H4191|Elisha had brought the dead]] [[H2421|back to life,]] [[H802|the woman]] [[H1121|whose son]] [[H2421|he had revived]] [[H6817|came to appeal]] [[H413|to]] [[H4428|the king]] [[H5921|for]] [[H1004|her house]] [[H5921|and]] [[H7704|her land.]] [[H1522|So Gehazi]] [[H559|said,]] [[H113|“My lord]] [[H4428|the king,]] [[H2063|this]] [[H802|is the woman,]] [[H2088|and this]] [[H1121|is the son]] [[H477|Elisha]] [[H2421|restored to life.]] ^0805

[[H4428|When the king]] [[H7592|asked]] [[H802|the woman,]] [[H5608|she confirmed it.]] [[H4428|So the king]] [[H5414|appointed]] [[H259|for her  an]] [[H5631|officer,]] [[H559|saying,]] [[H7725|“Restore]] [[H3605|all]] [[H834|that was hers,]] [[H3605|along with all]] [[H8393|the proceeds]] [[H7704|of the field]] [[H3117|from the day]] [[H5800|that she left]] [[H776|the country]] [[H5704|until]] [[H6258|now.]] ^0806

[[H477|Then Elisha]] [[H935|came]] [[H1834|to Damascus]] [[H1130|while Ben-hadad]] [[H4428|king]] [[H758|of Aram]] [[H2470|was sick,]] [[H5046|and the king was told,]] [[H376|“The man]] [[H430|of God]] [[H935|has come]] [[H2008|here.”]] ^0807

[[H4428|So the king]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H2371|Hazael,]] [[H3947|“Take]] [[H4503|a gift]] [[H3027|in your hand,]] [[H1980|go]] [[H7125|to meet]] [[H376|the man]] [[H430|of God,]] [[H1875|and inquire of]] [[H3069|the LORD]] [[H853|through him,]] [[H2421|‘Will I recover]] [[H2088|from this]] [[H2483|illness?’”]] ^0808

[[H2371|So Hazael]] [[H1980|went]] [[H7125|to meet Elisha,]] [[H3947|taking]] [[H3027|with him]] [[H4503|a gift]] [[H705|of forty]] [[H4853|camel-loads]] [[H3605|of every]] [[H2898|good thing]] [[H1834|from Damascus.]] [[H935|And he went in]] [[H5975|and stood]] [[H6440|before him]] [[H559|and said,]] [[H1121|“Your son]] [[H1130|Ben-hadad]] [[H4428|king]] [[H758|of Aram]] [[H7971|has sent]] [[H559|me to ask,]] [[H2421|Will I recover]] [[H2088|from this]] [[H2483|illness?]] ^0809

[[H477|Elisha]] [[H559|answered,]] [[H1980|“Go]] [[H559|and say to him,]] [[H2421|‘You will surely recover.’]] [[H3068|But the LORD]] [[H7200|has shown me]] [[H3588|that]] [[H4191|in fact]] [[H4191|he will die.”]] ^0810

⟨Elisha⟩ [[H5975|fixed]] [[H6440|his gaze]] [[H7760|steadily]] ⟨on him⟩ [[H5704|until]] [[H954|Hazael became uncomfortable.]] [[H376|Then the man]] [[H430|of God]] [[H1058|began to weep.]] ^0811

[[H4069|“Why]] [[H113|is my lord]] [[H1058|weeping?”]] [[H559|asked]] [[H2371|Hazael.]] [[H3588|“Because]] [[H3045|I know]] [[H7451|the evil]] [[H6213|you will do]] [[H3478|to the Israelites,”]] ⟨Elisha⟩ [[H559|replied.]] [[H7971|“You will set]] [[H784|fire]] [[H4013|to their fortresses,]] [[H2026|kill]] [[H970|their young men]] [[H2719|with the sword,]] [[H5768|dash their little ones]] [[H7376|to pieces,]] [[H1234|and rip open]] [[H2030|their pregnant women.”]] ^0812

[[H3588|“But]] [[H4100|what]] ⟨is⟩ [[H5650|your servant,]] [[H3611|a mere dog,]] [[H3588|that]] [[H6213|he should do]] [[H2088|this]] [[H1419|monstrous]] [[H1697|thing?”]] [[H559|said]] [[H2371|Hazael.]] [[H477|And Elisha]] [[H559|answered,]] [[H3068|“The LORD]] [[H7200|has shown me]] [[H854|that you]] ⟨will become⟩ [[H4428|king]] [[H5921|over]] [[H758|Aram.”]] ^0813

[[H1980|So Hazael left]] [[H477|Elisha]] [[H935|and went]] [[H113|to  his master,]] [[H559|who asked him,]] [[H4100|“What]] [[H477|did Elisha]] [[H559|say to you?”]] [[H559|And he replied,]] [[H559|“He told]] [[H2421|me  you would surely recover.”]] ^0814

[[H1961|But]] [[H4283|the next day]] [[H3947|Hazael took]] [[H4346|a thick cloth,]] [[H2881|dipped]] [[H4325|it in water,]] [[H6566|and spread]] [[H5921|it over]] [[H6440|the king’s face.]] [[H4191|So Ben-hadad died,]] [[H2371|and Hazael]] [[H4427|reigned]] [[H8478|in his place.]] ^0815

[[H2568|In the fifth]] [[H8141|year]] [[H4428|of the reign]] [[H3141|of Joram]] [[H1121|son]] [[H256|of Ahab]] [[H3478|over Israel,]] [[H3088|Jehoram]] [[H1121|son]] [[H3092|of Jehoshaphat]] [[H4427|succeeded his father]] [[H4428|as king]] [[H3063|of Judah.]] ^0816

[[H1961|Jehoram]] ⟨was⟩ [[H7970|thirty-two]] [[H1121|years old]] [[H4427|when he became king,]] [[H4427|and he reigned]] [[H3389|in Jerusalem]] [[H8083|eight]] [[H8141|years.]] ^0817

[[H1980|And walked]] ⟨Jehoram⟩ [[H1870|in the way]] [[H4428|of the kings]] [[H3478|of Israel,]] [[H834|just as]] [[H1004|the house]] [[H256|of Ahab]] [[H6213|had done.]] [[H3588|For]] [[H802|he married]] [[H1323|a daughter]] [[H256|of Ahab]] [[H6213|and did]] [[H7451|evil]] [[H5869|in the sight]] [[H3068|of the LORD.]] ^0818

[[H4616|Yet for the sake]] [[H5650|of His servant]] [[H1732|David,]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H3808|was unwilling]] [[H7843|to destroy]] [[H3063|Judah,]] [[H834|since]] [[H559|He had promised]] [[H5414|to maintain]] [[H5216|a lamp]] [[H1121|for David his descendants]] ⟨and⟩ [[H3605|forever.]] ^0819

[[H3117|In the days of Jehoram,]] [[H123|Edom]] [[H6586|rebelled]] [[H8478|against]] [[H3027|the hand]] [[H3063|of Judah]] [[H4427|and appointed]] [[H5921|their own]] [[H4428|king.]] ^0820

[[H3141|So Joram]] [[H5674|crossed over]] [[H6811|to Zair]] [[H5973|with]] [[H3605|all]] [[H7393|his chariots.]] [[H123|When the Edomites]] [[H5437|surrounded]] [[H413|him]] [[H853|and]] [[H7393|his chariot]] [[H8269|commanders,]] [[H1931|he]] [[H6965|rose up]] [[H5221|and attacked]] [[H3915|by night.]] [[H5971|His troops, however,]] [[H5127|fled]] [[H168|to their homes.]] ^0821

[[H5704|So to]] [[H2088|this]] [[H3117|day]] [[H123|Edom]] [[H6586|has been in rebellion]] [[H8478|against]] [[H3027|the hand of]] [[H3063|Judah.]] [[H227|Likewise,]] [[H3841|Libnah]] [[H6586|rebelled]] [[H1931|at the same]] [[H6256|time.]] ^0822

[[H8147|In the twelfth]] [[H8141|year]] [[H4428|of the reign]] [[H3141|of Joram]] [[H1121|son]] [[H256|of Ahab]] [[H3478|over Israel,]] [[H274|Ahaziah]] [[H1121|son]] [[H3088|of Jehoram]] [[H4427|became king]] [[H3063|of Judah.]] ^0825

[[H1980|And walked]] ⟨Ahaziah⟩ [[H1870|in the way]] [[H1004|of the house]] [[H256|of Ahab]] [[H6213|and did]] [[H7451|evil]] [[H5869|in the sight]] [[H3068|of the LORD]] [[H1004|like the house]] [[H256|of Ahab,]] [[H3588|for]] [[H1931|he]] [[H2860|was a son-in-law]] [[H1004|of the house]] [[H256|of Ahab.]] ^0827

[[H1980|Then Ahaziah went]] [[H854|with]] [[H3141|Joram]] [[H1121|son]] [[H256|of Ahab]] [[H4421|to fight]] [[H5973|against]] [[H2371|Hazael]] [[H4428|king]] [[H758|of Aram]] [[H7433|at Ramoth-gilead,]] [[H761|and the Arameans]] [[H5221|wounded]] [[H3141|Joram.]] ^0828

[[H3947|Then take]] [[H6378|the flask]] [[H8081|of oil,]] [[H3332|pour]] [[H5921|it on]] [[H7218|his head,]] [[H559|and declare,]] [[H3541|‘This is what]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H559|says:]] [[H4886|I anoint]] [[H4428|you king]] [[H413|over]] [[H3478|Israel.’]] [[H6605|Then open]] [[H1817|the door]] [[H5127|and run.]] [[H3808|Do not]] [[H2442|delay!”]] ^0903

[[H5288|So the young]] [[H5030|prophet]] [[H1980|went]] [[H7433|to Ramoth-gilead,]] ^0904

[[H935|and when he arrived,]] [[H2428|the army]] [[H8269|commanders]] [[H3427|were sitting]] [[H2009|there.]] [[H1697|“I have a message]] [[H413|for you,]] [[H8269|commander,”]] [[H559|he said.]] [[H413|“For]] [[H4310|which]] [[H3605|of us?”]] [[H559|asked]] [[H3058|Jehu.]] [[H413|“For you,]] [[H8269|commander,”]] [[H559|he replied.]] ^0905

[[H7392|So a horseman]] [[H1980|rode off]] [[H7125|to meet Jehu]] [[H559|and said,]] [[H3541|“This is what]] [[H4428|the king]] [[H559|asks:]] [[H7965|‘Have you come in peace?’”]] [[H4100|“What]] [[H7965|do you  know about peace?”]] [[H3058|Jehu]] [[H559|replied.]] [[H5437|“Fall in]] [[H310|behind me.”]] [[H6822|And the watchman]] [[H5046|reported,]] [[H4397|“The messenger]] [[H935|reached]] [[H1992|them,]] [[H3808|but he is not]] [[H7725|coming back.”]] ^0918

[[H6822|Again the watchman]] [[H5046|reported,]] [[H935|“He reached]] [[H413|them,]] [[H3808|but he is not]] [[H7725|coming back.]] [[H4491|And the charioteer]] [[H4491|is driving like]] [[H3058|Jehu]] [[H1121|son]] [[H5250|of Nimshi—]] [[H5090|he drives]] [[H7697|like a madman.”]] ^0920

[[H631|“Harness!”]] [[H3088|Joram]] [[H559|shouted,]] [[H631|and they harnessed]] [[H7393|his chariot.]] [[H3088|Then Joram]] [[H4428|king]] [[H3478|of Israel]] [[H274|and Ahaziah]] [[H4428|king]] [[H3063|of Judah]] [[H3318|set out,]] [[H376|each]] [[H7393|in his own chariot,]] [[H3318|and met]] [[H3058|Jehu]] [[H2513|on the property]] [[H5022|of Naboth]] [[H3158|the Jezreelite.]] ^0921

[[H3088|When Joram]] [[H7200|saw]] [[H3058|Jehu,]] [[H559|he asked,]] [[H7965|“Have you come in peace,]] [[H3058|Jehu?”]] [[H4100|“How]] [[H5704|can there be]] [[H7965|peace,”]] [[H559|he replied,]] [[H7227|“as long as]] [[H2183|the idolatry]] [[H3785|and witchcraft]] [[H517|of your mother]] [[H348|Jezebel abound?”]] ^0922

[[H3088|Joram]] [[H2015|turned around]] [[H5127|and fled,]] [[H559|calling out]] [[H413|to]] [[H274|Ahaziah,]] [[H4820|“Treachery,]] [[H274|Ahaziah!”]] ^0923

[[H3058|Then Jehu]] [[H4390|drew]] [[H7198|his bow]] [[H5221|and shot]] [[H3088|Joram]] [[H996|between]] [[H2220|the shoulders.]] [[H2678|The arrow]] [[H3318|pierced]] [[H3820|his heart,]] [[H3766|and he slumped down]] [[H7393|in his chariot.]] ^0924

[[H559|And said]] ⟨Jehu⟩ [[H413|to]] [[H920|Bidkar]] [[H7991|his officer,]] [[H5375|“Pick him up]] ⟨and⟩ [[H7993|throw him]] [[H7704|into the field]] [[H5022|of Naboth]] [[H3158|the Jezreelite.]] [[H3588|For]] [[H2142|remember that]] [[H859|when you]] [[H589|and I]] [[H7392|were riding]] [[H6776|together]] [[H310|behind]] [[H1|his father]] [[H256|Ahab,]] [[H3069|the LORD]] [[H5375|lifted up]] [[H2088|this]] [[H4853|oracle]] [[H5921|against him:]] ^0925

[[H518|‘As surely]] [[H7200|as I saw]] [[H1818|the blood]] [[H5022|of Naboth]] [[H1818|and the blood]] [[H1121|of his sons]] [[H570|yesterday,]] [[H5002|declares]] [[H3068|the LORD,]] [[H7999|so will I repay]] [[H2063|you on this]] [[H2513|plot of land,]] [[H5002|declares]] [[H3068|the LORD.’]] [[H6258|Now then,]] [[H1697|according to the word]] [[H3068|of the LORD,]] [[H5375|pick him up]] ⟨and⟩ [[H7993|throw him]] [[H2513|on the plot.”]] ⟨of land⟩ ^0926

[[H4428|When King]] [[H274|Ahaziah]] [[H3063|of Judah]] [[H7200|saw]] ⟨this⟩, [[H5127|he fled]] [[H1870|up the road]] [[H1588|toward Beth-haggan.]] [[H3058|And Jehu]] [[H7291|pursued him,]] [[H559|shouting,]] [[H5221|“Shoot]] [[H853|him]] [[H1571|too!”]] ⟨So they shot Ahaziah⟩ [[H413|in]] [[H4818|his chariot]] [[H4608|on the Ascent]] [[H1483|of Gur,]] [[H2991|near Ibleam,]] [[H5127|and he fled]] [[H4023|to Megiddo]] [[H4191|and died]] [[H8033|there.]] ^0927

[[H5650|Then his servants]] [[H7392|carried him by chariot]] [[H3389|to Jerusalem]] [[H6912|and buried]] [[H853|him]] [[H1|with his fathers]] [[H6900|in his tomb]] [[H5892|in the City]] [[H1732|of David.]] ^0928

[[H3058|Now when Jehu]] [[H935|arrived]] [[H3157|in Jezreel,]] [[H348|Jezebel]] [[H8085|heard]] ⟨of it⟩. [[H7760|So she painted]] [[H5869|her eyes,]] [[H3190|adorned]] [[H7218|her head,]] [[H8259|and looked down]] [[H1157|from]] [[H2474|a window.]] ^0930

[[H3058|And as Jehu]] [[H935|entered]] [[H8179|the gate,]] [[H559|she asked,]] [[H7965|“Have you come in peace,]] [[H2174|O Zimri,]] [[H2026|murderer]] [[H113|of your master?”]] ^0931

[[H5375|He looked up]] [[H413|at]] [[H2474|the window]] [[H559|and called out,]] [[H4310|“Who]] [[H854|is on my side?]] [[H4310|Who?”]] [[H8147|And two]] [[H7969|or three]] [[H5631|eunuchs]] [[H8259|looked down]] [[H413|at him.]] ^0932

[[H8058|“Throw her down!”]] [[H559|yelled]] ⟨Jehu⟩. [[H8058|So they threw her down,]] [[H1818|and her blood]] [[H5137|splattered]] [[H413|on]] [[H7023|the wall]] [[H413|and on]] [[H5483|the horses]] [[H7429|as they trampled her underfoot.]] ^0933

[[H935|Then went in]] ⟨Jehu⟩ [[H398|and ate]] [[H8354|and drank.]] [[H6485|“Take care of]] [[H2063|this]] [[H779|cursed,”]] ⟨woman⟩ [[H559|he said,]] [[H6912|“and bury her,]] [[H3588|for]] [[H1931|she]] ⟨was⟩ [[H1323|the daughter]] [[H4428|of a king.”]] ^0934

[[H1980|But when they went out]] [[H6912|to bury her,]] [[H4672|they found]] [[H3808|nothing but]] [[H1538|her skull,]] [[H7272|her feet,]] [[H3709|and the palms]] [[H3027|of her hands.]] ^0935

[[H7725|So they went back]] [[H5046|and told]] ⟨Jehu⟩ [[H559|,  who replied,]] [[H1931|“This]] [[H1697|is the word]] [[H3068|of the LORD,]] [[H834|which]] [[H1696|He spoke]] [[H3027|through]] [[H5650|His servant]] [[H452|Elijah]] [[H8664|the Tishbite:]] [[H2506|‘On the plot]] ⟨of land⟩ [[H3157|at Jezreel]] [[H3611|the dogs]] [[H398|will devour]] [[H348|Jezebel’s]] [[H1320|flesh.]] ^0936

[[H348|And Jezebel’s]] [[H5038|body]] [[H1961|will lie]] [[H1828|like dung]] [[H7704|in the field]] [[H2506|in the plot]] [[H3157|at Jezreel,]] [[H834|so that]] [[H3808|no one]] [[H559|can say:]] [[H2063|This]] [[H348|is Jezebel.’”]] ^0937

[[H256|Now Ahab]] [[H7657|had seventy]] [[H1121|sons]] [[H8111|in Samaria.]] [[H3058|So Jehu]] [[H3789|wrote]] [[H5612|letters]] [[H7971|and sent]] [[H8111|them to Samaria]] [[H413|to]] [[H8269|the officials]] [[H3157|of Jezreel,]] [[H2205|to the elders,]] [[H413|and to]] [[H539|the guardians]] ⟨of the sons⟩ [[H256|of Ahab,]] [[H559|saying:]] ^1001

[[H2088|“When this]] [[H5612|letter]] [[H935|arrives,]] [[H6258|since]] [[H113|your master’s]] [[H1121|sons]] [[H854|are with you]] [[H854|and you have]] [[H7393|chariots]] [[H5483|and horses,]] [[H4013|a fortified]] [[H5892|city]] [[H5402|and weaponry,]] ^1002

[[H7200|select]] [[H2896|the best]] [[H3477|and most worthy]] [[H1121|son]] [[H113|of your master,]] [[H7760|set]] [[H5921|him on]] [[H1|his father’s]] [[H3678|throne,]] [[H3898|and fight]] [[H5921|for]] [[H113|your master’s]] [[H1004|house.”]] ^1003

[[H3372|But they were terrified]] [[H559|and reasoned,]] [[H2009|“If]] [[H8147|two]] [[H4428|kings]] [[H3808|could not]] [[H5975|stand]] [[H6440|against him,]] [[H349|how]] [[H587|can we?”]] ^1004

[[H1004|So the palace]] [[H834|administrator,]] [[H834|the overseer]] [[H5892|of the city,]] [[H2205|the elders,]] [[H539|and the guardians]] [[H7971|sent]] [[H413|a message to]] [[H3058|Jehu:]] [[H587|“We]] [[H5650|are your servants,]] [[H6213|and we will do]] [[H3605|whatever]] [[H559|you say.]] [[H3808|We will not]] [[H376|make anyone]] [[H4427|king.]] [[H6213|Do]] ⟨whatever is⟩ [[H2896|good]] [[H5869|in your sight.”]] ^1005

[[H3789|Then Jehu wrote]] [[H413|them]] [[H8145|a second]] [[H5612|letter]] [[H559|and said:]] [[H518|“If]] [[H859|you are on my side,]] [[H859|and if you]] [[H8085|will obey me,]] [[H3947|then bring]] [[H7218|the heads]] [[H113|of your master’s]] [[H1121|sons]] [[H853|to me]] [[H3157|at Jezreel]] [[H6256|by this time]] [[H4279|tomorrow.”]] [[H4428|Now the king’s]] [[H1121|sons,]] [[H7657|seventy]] [[H376|in all,]] [[H1431|were being brought up]] [[H1419|by the leading men]] [[H5892|of the city.]] ^1006

[[H1961|And]] [[H5612|when the letter]] [[H935|arrived,]] [[H3947|they took]] [[H4428|the king’s]] [[H1121|sons]] [[H7819|and slaughtered]] [[H7657|all seventy]] [[H376|of them,]] [[H7760|put]] [[H7218|their heads]] [[H1731|in baskets,]] [[H7971|and sent]] [[H413|them to Jehu]] [[H3157|at Jezreel.]] ^1007

[[H4397|When the messenger]] [[H935|arrived,]] [[H5046|he told]] ⟨Jehu⟩ [[H935|,  “They have brought]] [[H7218|the heads]] [[H4428|of the king’s]] [[H1121|sons.”]] [[H559|And ordered,]] ⟨Jehu⟩ [[H7760|“Pile]] [[H8147|them in two]] [[H6652|heaps]] [[H6607|at the entrance]] [[H8179|of the gate]] [[H5704|until]] [[H1242|morning.”]] ^1008

[[H1242|The next morning,]] ⟨Jehu⟩ [[H3318|went out]] [[H5975|and stood]] [[H413|before]] [[H3605|all]] [[H5971|the people]] [[H559|and said,]] [[H859|“You]] [[H6662|are innocent.]] [[H589|It was I]] [[H7194|who conspired]] [[H5921|against]] [[H113|my master]] [[H2026|and killed him.]] [[H4310|But who]] [[H5221|killed]] [[H3605|all]] [[H428|these?]] ^1009

[[H3058|So Jehu]] [[H5221|killed]] [[H3605|everyone]] [[H3157|in Jezreel]] [[H7604|who remained]] [[H1004|of the house]] [[H256|of Ahab,]] [[H3605|as well as all]] [[H1419|his great men]] [[H3045|and close friends]] [[H3548|and priests,]] [[H7604|leaving]] [[H1115|him  without]] ⟨a single⟩ [[H8300|survivor.]] ^1011

[[H6965|Then set out]] ⟨Jehu⟩ [[H8111|toward Samaria.]] [[H1004|At]] [[H7462|Beth-eked of the Shepherds,]] ^1012

[[H3058|Jehu]] [[H4672|met]] [[H251|some relatives]] [[H274|of Ahaziah]] [[H4428|king]] [[H3063|of Judah]] [[H559|and asked,]] [[H4310|“Who]] [[H859|are you?”]] [[H587|“We are]] [[H251|relatives]] [[H274|of Ahaziah,”]] [[H559|they answered,]] [[H3381|“and we have come down]] [[H7965|to greet]] [[H1121|the sons]] [[H4428|of the king]] ⟨and⟩ [[H1121|]] [[H1377|of the queen mother.”]] ^1013

[[H559|Then Jehu ordered,]] [[H8610|“Take]] [[H2416|them alive.”]] [[H8610|So took]] ⟨his men⟩ [[H2416|them alive,]] [[H7819|then slaughtered them]] [[H413|at]] [[H953|the well]] [[H1044|of  Beth-eked—]] [[H705|forty-two]] [[H376|men.]] [[H3808|He]] [[H7604|spared]] [[H376|none]] [[H1992|of them.]] ^1014

[[H1980|When he left]] [[H8033|there,]] [[H4672|he found]] [[H3082|Jehonadab]] [[H1121|son]] [[H7394|of Rechab,]] [[H7125|who was coming to meet him.]] ⟨Jehu⟩ [[H1288|greeted him]] [[H559|and asked,]] [[H3426|“Is]] [[H3824|your heart]] [[H3477|as true to mine]] [[H834|as]] [[H3824|my heart]] [[H5973|is]] [[H3824|to yours?”]] [[H3426|“It is!”]] [[H3082|Jehonadab]] [[H559|replied.]] [[H3426|“If it is,” said Jehu,]] [[H5414|“give]] [[H3027|me your hand.”]] [[H5414|So he gave]] [[H3027|him his hand,]] [[H5927|and Jehu helped him]] [[H413|into]] [[H4818|his chariot,]] ^1015

[[H935|When Jehu came]] [[H8111|to Samaria,]] [[H5221|he struck down]] [[H3605|everyone]] [[H256|belonging to Ahab]] [[H7604|who remained]] ⟨there⟩ [[H8111|,]] [[H5704|until]] [[H8045|he had destroyed them,]] [[H1697|according to the word]] [[H834|that]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H1696|had spoken]] [[H413|to]] [[H452|Elijah.]] ^1017

[[H3058|Then Jehu]] [[H3605|brought all]] [[H5971|the people]] [[H6908|together]] [[H559|and said,]] [[H256|“Ahab]] [[H5647|served]] [[H1168|Baal]] [[H4592|a little,]] [[H3058|but Jehu]] [[H5647|will serve him]] [[H7235|a lot.]] ^1018

[[H6258|Now, therefore,]] [[H7121|summon]] [[H413|to]] [[H3605|me all]] [[H5030|the prophets]] [[H1168|of Baal,]] [[H3605|all]] [[H5647|his servants,]] [[H3605|and all]] [[H3548|his priests.]] [[H376|See that no one]] [[H6485|is missing,]] [[H3588|for]] [[H1419|I have  a great]] [[H2077|sacrifice]] [[H1168|for Baal.]] [[H3605|Whoever]] [[H6485|is missing]] [[H3808|will not]] [[H2421|live.”]] [[H3058|But Jehu]] [[H6213|was acting]] [[H6122|deceptively]] [[H4616|in order to]] [[H6|destroy]] [[H5647|the servants]] [[H1168|of Baal.]] ^1019

[[H3058|And Jehu]] [[H559|commanded,]] [[H6942|“Proclaim]] [[H6116|a solemn assembly]] [[H1168|for Baal.”]] [[H7121|So they called one.]] ^1020

[[H3058|Then Jehu]] [[H7971|sent word]] [[H3605|throughout]] [[H3478|Israel,]] [[H3605|and all]] [[H5647|the servants]] [[H1168|of Baal]] [[H935|came;]] [[H3808|there was not]] [[H376|a man]] [[H834|who]] [[H3808|failed]] [[H935|to show up.]] [[H935|They entered]] [[H1004|the temple]] [[H1168|of Baal,]] [[H1004|and it]] [[H4390|was filled]] [[H6310|from end]] [[H6310|to end.]] ^1021

[[H559|And said]] ⟨Jehu⟩ [[H834|to the keeper]] [[H4458|of the wardrobe,]] [[H3318|“Bring out]] [[H3830|garments]] [[H3605|for all]] [[H5647|the servants]] [[H1168|of Baal.”]] [[H3318|So he brought out]] [[H4403|garments]] ^1022

[[H7535|but]] [[H3058|he]] [[H3808|did not]] [[H5493|turn away]] [[H310|from]] [[H2399|the sins]] [[H3379|that Jeroboam]] [[H1121|son]] [[H5028|of Nebat]] [[H3478|had caused Israel]] [[H2398|to commit—]] [[H2091|the worship of the golden]] [[H5695|calves]] [[H1008|at Bethel]] [[H1835|and Dan.]] ^1029

[[H3068|Nevertheless, the LORD]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H3058|Jehu,]] [[H3282|“Because]] [[H2895|you have done well]] [[H6213|in carrying out]] [[H3477|what is right]] [[H5869|in My sight]] [[H6213|and have done]] [[H1004|to the house]] [[H256|of Ahab]] [[H3605|all]] [[H834|that]] [[H3824|was in My heart,]] [[H7243|four generations]] [[H1121|of your sons]] [[H3427|will sit]] [[H5921|on]] [[H3678|the throne]] [[H3478|of Israel.]] ^1030

[[H3058|Yet Jehu]] [[H3808|was not]] [[H8104|careful]] [[H1980|to follow]] [[H8451|the instruction]] [[H3068|of the LORD,]] [[H430|the God]] [[H3478|of Israel,]] [[H3605|with all]] [[H3824|his heart.]] [[H3808|He did not]] [[H5493|turn away]] [[H5921|from]] [[H2403|the sins]] [[H834|that]] [[H3379|Jeroboam]] [[H3478|had caused Israel]] [[H2398|to commit.]] ^1031

[[H3117|So the time]] [[H3058|of Jehu’s]] [[H4427|reign]] [[H5921|over]] [[H3478|Israel]] [[H8111|in Samaria]] ⟨was⟩ [[H6242|twenty-eight]] [[H8141|years.]] ^1036

[[H7637|Then in the seventh]] [[H8141|year,]] [[H3077|Jehoiada]] [[H7971|sent for]] [[H8269|the captains]] [[H3967|of hundreds,]] [[H3746|the Carites,]] [[H7323|and the guards,]] [[H935|and had them brought]] [[H1004|into the house]] [[H3068|of the LORD.]] ⟨There⟩ [[H1004|]] [[H3772|he made]] [[H1285|a covenant]] [[H1992|with them]] [[H7650|and put them under oath.]] [[H7200|He showed]] [[H853|them]] [[H4428|the king's]] [[H1121|son]] ^1104

[[H8147|the two]] [[H3027|divisions]] [[H3318|that would go off duty]] [[H7676|on the Sabbath]] [[H8104|are to guard]] [[H1004|the house]] [[H3068|of the LORD]] [[H413|for]] [[H4428|the king.]] ^1107

[[H8269|So the commanders]] [[H3967|of hundreds]] [[H6213|did]] [[H3605|everything]] [[H834|that]] [[H3077|Jehoiada]] [[H3548|the priest]] [[H6680|had ordered.]] [[H376|Each of them]] [[H3947|took]] [[H376|his men—]] [[H935|those coming on duty]] [[H7676|on the Sabbath]] [[H5973|and]] [[H3318|those going off duty—]] [[H935|and came]] [[H413|to]] [[H3077|Jehoiada]] [[H3548|the priest.]] ^1109

[[H3548|Then the priest]] [[H5414|gave]] [[H8269|to the commanders]] [[H3967|of hundreds]] [[H2595|the spears]] [[H853|and]] [[H7982|shields]] [[H4428|of King]] [[H1732|David]] [[H834|from]] [[H1004|the house]] [[H3068|of the LORD.]] ^1110

[[H7323|And the guards]] [[H5975|stood]] [[H3627|with weapons]] [[H3027|in hand]] [[H5439|surrounding]] [[H4428|the king]] [[H4196|by the altar]] [[H1004|and the temple,]] [[H3233|from the south]] [[H3802|side]] [[H5704|to]] [[H8042|the north]] [[H3802|side]] [[H1004|of the temple.]] ^1111

[[H3318|Then brought out]] ⟨Jehoiada⟩ [[H4428|the king’s]] [[H1121|son,]] [[H5414|put]] [[H5145|the crown]] [[H5921|on him,]] [[H5715|presented him with the Testimony,]] [[H4427|and proclaimed him king.]] [[H4886|They anointed him,]] [[H5221|and clapped]] ⟨the people⟩ [[H3709|their hands]] [[H559|and declared,]] [[H2421|“Long live]] [[H4428|the king!”]] ^1112

[[H6271|When Athaliah]] [[H8085|heard]] [[H6963|the noise]] [[H7323|from the guards]] ⟨and⟩ [[H5971|the people,]] [[H935|she went out]] [[H413|to]] [[H5971|the people]] [[H1004|in the house]] [[H3068|of the LORD.]] ^1113

[[H7200|And she looked out]] [[H2009|and saw]] [[H4428|the king,]] [[H5975|standing]] [[H5921|by]] [[H5982|the pillar,]] [[H4941|according to the custom.]] [[H8269|The officers]] [[H2689|and trumpeters]] [[H413|were beside]] [[H4428|the king,]] [[H3605|and all]] [[H5971|the people]] [[H776|of the land]] [[H8056|were rejoicing]] [[H8628|and blowing]] [[H2689|trumpets.]] [[H6271|Then Athaliah]] [[H7167|tore]] [[H899|her clothes]] [[H7121|and screamed,]] [[H7195|Treason!]] [[H7195|Treason!]] ^1114

[[H3077|And Jehoiada]] [[H3548|the priest]] [[H6680|ordered]] [[H8269|the commanders]] [[H3967|of hundreds]] [[H6485|in charge of]] [[H2428|the army,]] [[H3318|“Bring her out]] [[H7713|between the ranks,]] [[H4191|and put to]] [[H2719|the sword]] [[H935|anyone who follows]] [[H310|her.”]] [[H3588|For]] [[H3548|the priest]] [[H559|had said,]] [[H408|“She must not]] [[H4191|be put to death]] [[H1004|in the house]] [[H3068|of the LORD.”]] ^1115

[[H7760|So they seized]] ⟨Athaliah⟩ [[H3027|]] [[H935|as she reached]] [[H5483|the horses']] [[H3996|entrance]] [[H4428|to the palace grounds,]] [[H8033|and there]] [[H4191|she was put to death.]] ^1116

[[H3077|Then Jehoiada]] [[H3772|made]] [[H1285|a covenant]] [[H996|between]] [[H3068|the LORD,]] [[H4428|the king,]] [[H5971|and the people]] [[H1961|that they would be]] [[H3068|the LORD’s]] [[H5971|people.]] [[H996|He also made a covenant between]] [[H4428|the king]] [[H996|and]] [[H5971|the people.]] ^1117

[[H3605|So all]] [[H5971|the people]] [[H776|of the land]] [[H935|went]] [[H1004|to the temple]] [[H1168|of Baal]] [[H5422|and tore it down.]] [[H4196|They smashed the altars]] [[H6754|and idols]] [[H7665|into pieces,]] [[H2026|and they killed]] [[H4977|Mattan]] [[H3548|the priest]] [[H1168|of Baal]] [[H6440|in front of]] [[H4196|the altars.]] [[H3548|And Jehoiada the priest]] [[H7760|posted]] [[H6486|guards]] [[H5921|for]] [[H1004|the house]] [[H3068|of the LORD.]] ^1118

[[H7535|Nevertheless,]] [[H1116|the high places]] [[H3808|were not]] [[H5493|removed;]] [[H5971|the people]] [[H5750|continued]] [[H2076|sacrificing]] [[H6999|and burning incense]] ⟨there⟩ [[H1116|.]] ^1203

[[H3060|Then Joash]] [[H559|said]] [[H413|to]] [[H3548|the priests,]] [[H3605|“ all]] ⟨Collect⟩ [[H3701|the money]] [[H935|brought]] [[H6944|as sacred gifts]] [[H1004|into the house]] [[H3068|of the LORD—]] [[H5674|the census]] [[H3701|money,]] [[H3701|the money]] [[H5315|from vows,]] ⟨and⟩ [[H3605|]] [[H3701|the money]] [[H935|brought]] [[H5927|voluntarily]] [[H1004|into the house]] [[H3068|of the LORD.]] ^1204

[[H376|Let every]] [[H3548|priest]] [[H3947|receive]] ⟨it⟩ [[H4378|from his constituency,]] [[H1992|and let it be used]] [[H2388|to repair]] [[H919|any damage]] [[H4672|found]] [[H1004|in the temple.”]] ^1205

[[H4428|So King]] [[H3060|Joash]] [[H7121|called]] [[H3077|Jehoiada]] [[H3548|and the other priests]] [[H559|and said,]] [[H4069|“Why]] [[H369|have you not]] [[H2388|repaired]] [[H919|the damage]] [[H1004|in the temple?]] [[H6258|Now, therefore,]] [[H3947|take]] [[H408|no more]] [[H3701|money]] [[H853|from]] [[H4378|your constituency,]] [[H3588|but]] [[H5414|hand it over]] [[H919|for the repair]] [[H1004|of the temple.]] ^1207

[[H3588|Instead,]] [[H5414|it was paid]] [[H6213|to those doing]] [[H4399|the work,]] [[H2388|and with it  they repaired]] [[H1004|the house]] [[H3068|of the LORD.]] ^1214

[[H6213|And he did]] [[H7451|evil]] [[H5869|in the sight]] [[H3068|of the LORD,]] [[H7535|but]] [[H3808|not]] [[H4428|like the kings]] [[H3478|of Israel]] [[H834|who]] [[H1961|preceded]] [[H6440|him.]] ^1702

[[H8022|Shalmaneser]] [[H4428|king]] [[H804|of Assyria]] [[H5921|attacked]] [[H5927|him,]] [[H1954|and Hoshea]] [[H1961|became]] [[H5650|his vassal]] [[H7725|and paid]] [[H4503|him tribute.]] ^1703

[[H4428|But the king]] [[H804|of Assyria]] [[H4672|discovered]] [[H1954|that Hoshea]] [[H7195|had conspired]] [[H7971|to send]] [[H4397|envoys]] [[H413|to]] [[H4428|King]] [[H5471|So]] [[H4714|of Egypt,]] [[H3808|and that he had not]] [[H5927|paid]] [[H4503|tribute]] [[H4428|to the king]] [[H804|of Assyria]] [[H8141|as in previous years.]] [[H4428|Therefore the king]] [[H804|of Assyria]] [[H6113|arrested]] ⟨Hoshea⟩ [[H631|and put him]] [[H3608|in prison.]] ^1704

[[H4428|Then the king]] [[H804|of Assyria]] [[H5927|invaded]] [[H3605|the whole]] [[H776|land,]] [[H5927|marched up]] [[H8111|to Samaria,]] [[H6696|and besieged]] [[H5921|it]] [[H7969|for three]] [[H8141|years.]] ^1705

[[H1961|All this happened]] [[H3588|because]] [[H1121|the people]] [[H3478|of Israel]] [[H2398|had sinned]] [[H3068|against the LORD]] [[H430|their God,]] [[H5927|who had brought]] [[H853|them]] [[H776|out of the land]] [[H4714|of Egypt]] [[H8478|from under]] [[H3027|the hand]] [[H6547|of Pharaoh]] [[H4428|king]] [[H4714|of Egypt.]] [[H3372|They had worshiped]] [[H312|other]] [[H430|gods,]] ^1707

[[H1121|The Israelites]] [[H2644|secretly did]] [[H5921|things against]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H430|their God]] [[H834|that]] ⟨were⟩ [[H3808|not]] [[H3651|right.]] [[H4026|From watchtower]] [[H5704|to]] [[H4013|fortified]] [[H5892|city,]] [[H1129|they built]] [[H1116|high places]] [[H3605|in all]] [[H5892|their cities.]] ^1709

[[H5324|They set up]] [[H4676|for themselves pillars]] ⟨sacred⟩ [[H842|and Asherah poles]] [[H5921|on]] [[H3605|every]] [[H1364|high]] [[H1389|hill]] [[H8478|and under]] [[H3605|every]] [[H7488|green]] [[H6086|tree.]] ^1710

[[H6999|They burned incense]] [[H3605|on all]] [[H1116|the high places]] [[H1471|like the nations]] [[H834|whom]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H1540|had driven out]] [[H6440|before them.]] [[H6213|They did]] [[H7451|wicked]] [[H1697|things,]] [[H3707|provoking]] [[H3068|the LORD]] ⟨to anger⟩. ^1711

[[H5647|They served]] [[H1544|idols,]] [[H3068|although the LORD]] [[H559|had told them,]] [[H3808|“You shall not]] [[H6213|do]] [[H2088|this.”]] ^1712

[[H3027|Yet through]] [[H3605|all]] [[H5030|His prophets]] ⟨and⟩ [[H3605|]] [[H2374|seers,]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H5749|warned]] [[H3478|Israel]] [[H3063|and Judah,]] [[H559|saying,]] [[H7725|“Turn]] [[H7451|from your wicked]] [[H1870|ways]] [[H8104|and keep]] [[H4687|My commandments]] [[H2708|and statutes,]] [[H3605|according to the entire]] [[H8451|Law]] [[H834|that]] [[H6680|I commanded]] [[H1|your forefathers]] [[H7971|and delivered]] [[H413|to you]] [[H3027|through]] [[H5650|My servants]] [[H5030|the prophets.]] ^1713

[[H3808|But they would not]] [[H8085|listen,]] [[H7185|and they stiffened]] [[H6203|their necks]] [[H1|like their fathers,]] [[H834|who]] [[H3808|did not]] [[H539|believe]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H430|their God.]] ^1714

[[H3988|They rejected]] [[H2706|His statutes]] [[H1285|and the covenant]] [[H3772|He had made]] [[H854|with]] [[H1|their fathers,]] [[H5715|as well as the decrees]] [[H5749|He had given them.]] [[H1980|They pursued]] [[H1892|worthless idols]] [[H1891|and themselves became worthless,]] [[H310|going after]] [[H5439|the surrounding]] [[H1471|nations]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H6680|had commanded]] [[H1115|them not]] [[H6213|to imitate.]] ^1715

[[H5800|They abandoned]] [[H3605|all]] [[H4687|the commandments]] [[H3068|of the LORD]] [[H430|their God]] [[H6213|and made]] [[H8147|for themselves  two]] [[H4541|cast idols]] [[H5695|of calves]] [[H842|and an Asherah pole.]] [[H7812|They bowed down to]] [[H3605|all]] [[H6635|the host]] [[H8064|of heaven]] [[H5647|and served]] [[H1168|Baal.]] ^1716

[[H5674|They sacrificed]] [[H1121|their sons]] [[H1323|and daughters]] [[H784|in the fire]] [[H7080|and practiced]] [[H7081|divination]] [[H5172|and soothsaying.]] [[H4376|They devoted themselves]] [[H6213|to doing]] [[H7451|evil]] [[H5869|in the sight]] [[H3068|of the LORD,]] [[H3707|provoking Him to anger.]] ^1717

[[H3068|So the LORD]] [[H3966|was very]] [[H599|angry]] [[H3478|with Israel,]] [[H5493|and He removed]] [[H5921|them from]] [[H6440|His presence.]] [[H7535|Only]] [[H7626|the tribe]] [[H3063|of Judah]] [[H7604|remained,]] ^1718

[[H1571|and even]] [[H3063|Judah]] [[H3808|did not]] [[H8104|keep]] [[H4687|the commandments]] [[H3068|of the LORD]] [[H430|their God,]] [[H1980|but lived]] [[H2708|according to the customs]] [[H3478|Israel]] [[H6213|had introduced.]] ^1719

[[H3068|So the LORD]] [[H3988|rejected]] [[H3605|all]] [[H2233|the descendants]] [[H3478|of Israel.]] [[H6031|He afflicted them]] [[H5414|and delivered them]] [[H3027|into the hands]] [[H8154|of plunderers,]] [[H834|until]] [[H7993|He had banished them]] [[H6440|from His presence.]] ^1720

[[H3588|When]] ⟨the LORD⟩ [[H7167|had torn]] [[H3478|Israel]] [[H5921|away from]] [[H1004|the house]] [[H1732|of David,]] [[H3379|they made Jeroboam]] [[H1121|son]] [[H5028|of Nebat]] [[H4427|king,]] [[H3379|and Jeroboam]] [[H3478|led Israel]] [[H310|away from following]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H2398|and caused them to commit]] [[H1419|a great]] [[H2401|sin.]] ^1721

[[H1121|The Israelites]] [[H1980|persisted]] [[H3605|in all]] [[H2403|the sins]] [[H834|that]] [[H3379|Jeroboam]] [[H6213|committed]] [[H3808|and did not]] [[H5493|turn away]] [[H4480|from them.]] ^1722

[[H5704|Finally,]] [[H3068|the LORD]] [[H5493|removed]] [[H3478|Israel]] [[H5921|from]] [[H6440|His presence,]] [[H834|as]] [[H1696|He had declared]] [[H3027|through]] [[H3605|all]] [[H5650|His servants]] [[H5030|the prophets.]] [[H3478|So Israel]] [[H1540|was exiled]] [[H5921|from]] [[H127|their homeland]] [[H804|into Assyria,]] ⟨where they are⟩ [[H5704|to]] [[H2088|this]] [[H3117|day.]] ^1723

[[H4428|Then the king]] [[H804|of Assyria]] [[H935|brought]] [[H894|people from Babylon,]] [[H3575|Cuthah,]] [[H5755|Avva,]] [[H2574|Hamath,]] [[H5617|and Sepharvaim]] [[H3427|and settled them]] [[H5892|in the towns]] [[H8111|of Samaria]] [[H8478|to replace]] [[H1121|the Israelites.]] [[H3423|They took possession of]] [[H8111|Samaria]] [[H3427|and lived]] [[H5892|in its towns.]] ^1724

[[H1961|Now]] [[H8462|when first]] ⟨the settlers⟩ [[H3427|lived]] [[H8033|there,]] [[H3808|they did not]] [[H3372|worship]] [[H3068|the LORD,]] [[H3068|so He]] [[H7971|sent]] [[H738|lions among them,]] [[H1961|which]] [[H2026|killed]] ⟨some⟩ ^1725

[[H4428|Then the king]] [[H804|of Assyria]] [[H6680|commanded:]] [[H1980|“Send back]] [[H259|one]] [[H3548|of the priests]] [[H1540|you carried off]] [[H8033|from]] ⟨Samaria⟩, [[H1980|and have him go back]] [[H3427|to live]] [[H8033|there]] [[H3384|and teach]] [[H4941|the requirements]] [[H430|of the God]] [[H776|of the land.”]] ^1727

[[H1961|Nevertheless,]] [[H1471|the people of each nation]] [[H6213|continued to make]] [[H430|their own gods]] [[H5892|in the cities]] [[H834|where]] [[H1992|they]] [[H3427|had settled,]] [[H3240|and they set them up]] [[H1004|in the shrines]] [[H834|that]] [[H1471|the people]] [[H8118|of Samaria]] [[H6213|had made]] [[H1116|on the high places.]] ^1729

[[H935|Then Josiah brought]] [[H3605|all]] [[H3548|the priests]] [[H5892|from the cities]] [[H3063|of Judah]] [[H2930|and desecrated]] [[H1116|the high places,]] [[H834|from]] [[H1387|Geba]] [[H5704|to]] [[H884|Beersheba,]] [[H8033|where]] [[H3548|the priests]] [[H6999|had burned incense.]] [[H5422|He tore down]] [[H1116|the high places]] [[H8179|of the gates]] [[H6607|at the entrance]] [[H8179|of the gate]] [[H3091|of Joshua,]] [[H8269|the governor]] [[H5892|of the city,]] [[H834|which was]] [[H5921|to]] [[H8040|the left]] [[H5892|of the city]] [[H8179|gate.]] ^2308

[[H559|Then asked,]] ⟨the king⟩ [[H4100|“What]] [[H1975|is this]] [[H6725|monument]] [[H589|I]] [[H7200|see?”]] [[H376|And the men]] [[H5892|of the city]] [[H559|replied,]] [[H6913|“It is the tomb]] [[H376|of the man]] [[H430|of God]] [[H834|who]] [[H935|came]] [[H3063|from Judah]] [[H7121|and pronounced]] [[H428|these]] [[H1697|things]] [[H834|that]] [[H6213|you have done]] [[H5921|to]] [[H4196|the altar]] [[H1008|of  Bethel.”]] ^2317

[[H1540|He carried into exile]] [[H3605|all]] [[H3389|Jerusalem—]] [[H3605|all]] [[H8269|the commanders]] [[H853|and]] [[H1368|mighty warriors,]] [[H3605|all]] [[H2796|the craftsmen]] [[H4525|and metalsmiths—]] [[H6235|ten]] [[H505|thousand]] [[H1473|captives]] ⟨in all⟩.

[[H4428|Then the king]] [[H894|of Babylon]] [[H4983|made Mattaniah,]] ⟨Jehoiachin's⟩ [[H1730|uncle,]] [[H4427|king]] [[H8478|in his place]] [[H5437|and changed]] [[H8034|his name]] [[H6667|to Zedekiah.]] ^2417

[[H6667|Zedekiah]] [[H6242|was twenty-one]] [[H1121|years old]] [[H4427|when he became king,]] [[H4427|and he reigned]] [[H3389|in Jerusalem]] [[H259|eleven]] [[H8141|years.]] [[H517|His mother’s]] [[H8034|name]] [[H2537|was Hamutal]] [[H1323|daughter]] [[H3414|of Jeremiah;]] [[H3841|she was from Libnah.]] ^2418

[[H6213|And did]] ⟨Zedekiah⟩ [[H7451|evil]] [[H5869|in the sight]] [[H3068|of the LORD,]] [[H3605|just as]] [[H3079|Jehoiakim]] [[H6213|had done.]] ^2419

[[H3588|For]] [[H5921|because]] [[H639|of the anger]] [[H3068|of the LORD,]] ⟨all this⟩ [[H1961|happened]] [[H3389|in Jerusalem]] [[H3063|and Judah,]] [[H5704|until]] [[H7993|He finally banished]] [[H853|them]] [[H5921|from]] [[H6440|His presence.]] [[H6667|And Zedekiah also]] [[H4775|rebelled]] [[H4428|against the king]] [[H894|of Babylon.]] ^2420

[[H5892|Then the city]] [[H1234|was breached;]] [[H3778|and though the Chaldeans]] [[H5439|had surrounded]] [[H5892|the city,]] [[H3605|all]] [[H376|the men]] [[H4421|of war]] [[H3915|fled by night]] [[H1870|by way]] [[H8179|of the gate]] [[H996|between]] [[H2346|the two walls]] [[H5921|near]] [[H4428|the king’s]] [[H1588|garden.]] [[H1980|They fled]] [[H1870|toward]] [[H6160|the Arabah,]] ^2504

[[H8610|The Chaldeans seized]] [[H4428|the king]] [[H5927|and brought him up]] [[H413|to]] [[H4428|the king]] [[H894|of Babylon]] [[H7247|at Riblah,]] [[H1696|where they pronounced]] [[H4941|judgment]] [[H854|on him.]] ^2506

[[H853|And]] [[H7819|they slaughtered]] [[H1121|the sons]] [[H6667|of Zedekiah]] [[H5869|before his eyes.]] [[H853|Then]] [[H5786|they put out]] ⟨his⟩ [[H6667|]] [[H5869|eyes,]] [[H631|bound him]] [[H5178|in bronze shackles,]] [[H935|and took]] [[H894|him to Babylon.]] ^2507

[[H7651|On the seventh]] [[H2549|day of the fifth]] [[H2320|month,]] [[H8672|in the nineteenth]] [[H8141|year]] [[H5019|of Nebuchadnezzar's]] [[H4428|reign]] [[H894|over Babylon,]] [[H5018|Nebuzaradan]] [[H7227|the captain]] [[H2876|of the guard,]] [[H5650|a servant]] [[H4428|of the king]] [[H894|of Babylon,]] [[H935|entered]] [[H3389|Jerusalem.]] ^2508

[[H8313|He burned down]] [[H1004|the house]] [[H3068|of the LORD,]] [[H4428|the royal]] [[H1004|palace,]] [[H3605|and all]] [[H1004|the houses]] [[H3389|of Jerusalem—]] [[H3605|every]] [[H1419|significant]] [[H1004|building.]] ^2509

[[H5018|Then Nebuzaradan]] [[H7227|the captain]] [[H2876|of the guard]] [[H1540|carried into exile]] [[H5971|the people]] [[H7604|who remained]] [[H5892|in the city,]] [[H853|along with]] [[H5307|the deserters]] [[H834|who]] [[H5307|had defected]] [[H5921|to]] [[H4428|the king]] [[H894|of Babylon]] [[H3499|and the rest]] [[H1995|of the population.]] ^2511

[[H7227|But the captain]] [[H2876|of the guard]] [[H7604|left behind]] [[H1803|some of the poorest]] [[H776|of the land]] [[H3755|to tend the vineyards]] [[H1461|and fields.]] ^2512

[[H853|Moreover,]] [[H3778|the Chaldeans]] [[H7665|broke up]] [[H5178|the bronze]] [[H5982|pillars]] [[H853|and]] [[H4350|the stands]] [[H5178|and the bronze]] [[H3220|sea]] [[H1004|in the house]] [[H3068|of the LORD,]] [[H5375|and they carried]] [[H5178|the bronze]] [[H894|to Babylon.]] ^2513

[[H3947|They also took away]] [[H5518|the pots,]] [[H3257|shovels,]] [[H4212|wick trimmers,]] [[H3709|dishes,]] [[H3605|and all]] [[H3627|the articles]] [[H5178|of bronze]] [[H8334|used in temple service.]] ^2514
